Present \\nconsumption is sacrificed to get a return in the future. The sacrifice that has to be borne is \\ncertain but the return in the future may be uncertain. This attribute of investment indicates \\nthe risk factor. The risk is undertaken with a view to reap some return from the investment. \\nFor a layman, investment means some monetary commitment. A person’s commitment to \\nbuy a flat or a house for his personal use may be an investment from his point of view. This \\ncannot be considered as an actual investment as it involves sacrifice but does not yield any \\nfinancial return.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='4\\n To the economist, investment is the net addition made to the nation’s capital stock \\nthat consists of goods and services that are used in the production process. A net addition \\nto the capital stock means an increase in the buildings, equipments or inventories. These \\ncapital stocks are used to produce other goods and services.\\n Financial investment is the allocation of money of assets that are expected to yield \\nsome gain over a period of time. It is an exchange of financial claims such as stocks and \\nbonds for money. They are expected to yield returns and experience capital growth over the \\nyears.\\n The financial and economic meanings are related to each other because the savings of \\nthe individual flow into the capital market as financial investments, to be used in economic \\ninvestment. Even though they are related to each other, we are concerned only about the \\nfinancial investment made on securities.\\n Thus, investment may be defined as “a commitment of funds made in the expectation \\nof some positive rate of return” . Expectation of return is an essential element of investment. \\n Since the return is expected to be realized in future, there is a possibility that the \\nreturn actually realized is lower than the return expected to be realized. This possibility of \\nvariation in the actual return is known as investment risk. Thus, every investment involves \\nreturn and risk.\\nCharacteristics of Investment\\nAll investments are characterized by certain features. Let us analyse these \\ncharacteristic features of investment.\\nReturn\\nAll investments are characterized by the expectation of a return. In fact, investments \\nare made with the primary objective of deriving a return. The return may be received in the \\nform of yield plus capital appreciation. \\nThe difference between the sale price and the purchase price is capital appreciation. \\nThe dividend or interest received from the investment is the yield. Different types of \\ninvestments promise different rates of return. The return from an investment depends upon \\nthe nature of the investment, the maturity period and a host of other factors. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='5\\nRisk\\nRisk is inherent in any investment. This risk may relate to loss of capital, delay \\nin repayment of capital, non-payment of interest, or variability of returns. While some \\ninvestments like government securities and bank deposits are almost riskless, others are \\nmore risky. \\nThe risk of an investment depends on the following factors.\\n1. The longer the maturity period, the larger is the risk.\\n2. The lower the credit worthiness of the borrower, the higher is the risk.\\n3. The risk varies with the nature of investment. Investments in ownership securities \\nlike equity shares carry higher risk compared to investments in debt instruments \\nlike debentures and bonds.\\n Risk and return of an investment are related. Normally, the higher the risk, the \\nhigher is the return.\\nSafety\\nThe safety of on investment implies the certainty of return of capital without loss \\nof money or time. Safety is another feature which an investor desires for his investments. \\nEvery investor expects to get back his capital on maturity without loss and without delay.\\nLiquidity\\nAn investment which is easily saleable or marketable without loss of money and \\nwithout loss of time is said to possess liquidity. Some investments like company deposits, \\nbank deposits, P .O. Deposits, NSC, NSS, etc. are not marketable. \\nSome investment instruments like preference shares and debentures are marketable, \\nbut there are no buyers in many cases and hence their liquidity is negligible. Equity shares \\nof companies listed on stock exchanges are easily marketable through the stock exchanges.\\n An investor generally prefers liquidity for his investments, safety of his funds, a good \\nreturn with minimum risk or minimization of risk and maximization of return.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='6\\nObjectives of Investment\\n An investor has various alternative avenues of investment for his savings to flow to. \\nSavings kept as cash are barren and do not earn anything. Hence, savings are invested in \\nassets depending on their risk and return characteristics. The objectives of the investor are \\nminimizing the risk involved in investment and maximize the return from the investment.\\n Our savings kept as cash are not only barren because they do not earn anything, but \\nalso loses its value to the extent of rise in prices. Thus, rise in prices or inflation erodes the \\nvalue of money. Savings are invested to provide a hedge or protection against inflation. If \\nthe investment cannot earn as much as the rise in prices, the real rate of return would be \\nnegative. Thus, if inflation is at an average annual rate of ten percent, then the return from \\nan investment should be above ten percent to induce savings to flow into investment. \\nThus, the objectives of an investor can be stated as:\\n  ➢ Maximisation of return.\\n  ➢ Minimization of risk\\n  ➢ Hedge against inflation.\\nInvestors, in general, desire to earn as large returns as possible with the minimum \\nof risk. Risk here may be understood as the probability that actual returns realized from an \\ninvestment may be different from the expected return. If we consider the financial assets \\navailable for investment, we can classify them into different risk categories. Government \\nsecurities would constitute the low risk category as they are practically risk free. Debentures \\nand preference shares of companies may be classified as medium risk assets. Equity shares \\nof companies would form the high risk category of financial assets. An investor would be \\nprepared to assume higher risk only if he expects to get proportionately higher returns. \\nThere is a trade-off between risk and return. The expected return of an investment is \\ndirectly proportional to its risk. Thus, in the financial market, there are different financial \\nassets with varying risk-return combinations.\\nInvestment Vs Speculation\\nInvestment and speculation are two terms which are closely related. Both involve \\npurchase of assets like shares and securities. Traditionally, investment is distinguished from \\nspeculation with respect to three factors, viz. (1) risk, (2) capital gain and (3) time period.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='7\\nRisk\\nIt refers to the possibility of incurring a loss in a financial transaction. It arises \\nfrom the possibility of variation in returns from an investment. Risk is invariably related to \\nreturn. Higher return is associated with higher risk.\\nNo investment is completely risk free. An investor generally commits his funds to \\nlow risk investment, whereas a speculator commits his funds to higher risk investments. A \\nspeculator is prepared to take higher risks in order to achieve higher returns.\\nCapital Gain\\nThe speculator’s motive is to achieve profits through price charges, i.e. he is \\ninterested in capital gains rather than the income from the investment. If purchase of \\nsecurities is preceded by proper investigation and analysis to receive a stable return and \\ncapital appreciation over a period of time, it is investment. \\nThus, speculation is associated with buying low and selling high with the hope \\nof making large capital gains. A speculator consequently engages in frequent buying and \\nselling transactions.\\nTime Period\\nInvestment is long-term in nature, whereas speculation is short-term. An investor \\ncommits his funds for a longer period and waits for his return. But a speculator is interested \\nin short-term trade gains through buying and selling of investment instruments.\\nAnalysis of these distinctions helps us to identify the role of an investor and a \\nspeculator. An investor is interested in a good rate of return earned on a rather consistent \\nbasis for a relatively longer period of time. He evaluates the worth of a security before \\ninvesting in it. A speculator seeks opportunities promising very large returns earned rather \\nquickly. He is interested in market action and price movements. Consequently, speculation \\nis more risky than investment. \\n Basically, both investment and speculation aim at good returns. The difference is in \\nmotives and methods. As a result, the distinction between investment and speculation is \\nnot very wide. Investment is sometimes described as a well grounded and carefully planned \\nspeculation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='8\\nInvestment Vs Gambling\\nInvestment has also to be distinguished from gambling. Typical examples of gambling \\nare horse races, card games, lotteries, etc. Gambling consists in taking high risks not only for \\nhigh returns, but also for thrill and excitement. Gambling is unplanned and non scientific, \\nwithout knowledge of the nature of the risk involved. It is surrounded by uncertainty and \\nis based on tips and rumors. In gambling artificial and unnecessary risks are created for \\nincreasing the returns.\\n Investment is an attempt to carefully plan, evaluate and allocate funds to various \\ninvestment outlets which offer safety of principal and moderate and continuous return over \\na long period of time. Gambling is quite the opposite of investment.\\nTypes of Investors\\nInvestors may be individuals and institutions. Individual investors operate alongside \\ninstitutional investors in the investment arena. However, their characteristics are different.\\n Individual investors are large in number but their investable resources are \\ncomparatively smaller. They generally lack the skill to carry out extensive evaluation and \\nanalysis before investing. Moreover, they do not have the time and resources to engage in \\nsuch an analysis.\\n Institutional investors, on the other hand, are the organizations with surplus funds \\nwho engage in investment activities. Mutual funds, investment companies, banking and \\nnon-banking companies, insurance corporations, etc. are the organizations with large \\namounts of surplus funds to be invested in various profitable avenues. \\n These institutional investors are fewer in number compared to individual investors, \\nbut their investable resources are much larger. The institutional investors engage professional \\nfund managers to carry out extensive analysis and evaluation of different investment \\nopportunities. \\n As a result their investment activity tends to be more rational and scientific. They \\nhave a better chance of maximizing returns and minimizing risk.\\n The professional investors and the unskilled individual investors combine to make \\nthe investment arena dynamic.'),\n",

Some of them \\nare marketable and liquid while others are non marketable. Some of them are highly risky \\nwhile some others are almost riskless. The investor has to choose proper avenues from \\namong them depending on his preferences, needs and ability to assume risk.\\nThe investment avenues can be broadly categorized under the following heads:\\n1. Corporate securities \\n2. Deposits in banks and non-banking companies\\n3. UTI and other mutual fund schemes\\n4. Post office deposits and certificates\\n5. Life insurance polices\\n6. Provident fund schemes\\n7. Government and semi-government securities.\\nCorporate Securities\\nCorporate securities are the securities issued by joint stock companies in the private \\nsector. These include equity shares, preference shares and debentures. Equity shares have \\nvariable divided and hence belong to the high risk-high return category, while preference \\nshares and debentures have fixed returns with lower risk.\\nDeposits\\nAmong the non-corporate investments, the most popular are deposits with banks \\nsuch as savings accounts and fixed deposits. Savings deposits have low interest rates whereas \\nfixed deposits have higher interest rates varying with the period of maturity. \\nInterest is payable quarterly or half-yearly. Fixed deposits may also be recurring \\ndeposits wherein savings are deposited at regular intervals. Some banks have reinvestment \\nplans wherein the interest is reinvested as it gets accrued. The principal and accumulated \\ninterests are paid on maturity.\\nJoint stock companies also accept fixed deposits from the public. The maturity \\nperiod varies from three to five years. Fixed deposits in companies have high risk since they \\nare unsecured, but they promise higher returns than bank deposits.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='10\\nFixed deposit in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is another investment \\navenue open to savers. NBFCs include leasing companies, investment companies, chit funds, \\netc. Deposits in NSFCs carry higher returns with higher risk compared to bank deposits. \\nUTI and Other Mutual Fund Schemes\\nMutual funds offer various investment schemes to investors. UTI is the oldest and \\nthe largest mutual fund in the country. Unit Scheme 1964, Unit Linked Insurance Plan \\n1971, Master Share, Master Equity Plans, Master gain, etc. are some of the popular schemes \\nof UTI. A number of commercial banks and financial institutions have set up mutual funds. \\nRecently mutual funds have been set up in the private sector also.\\nPost Office Deposits and Certificates\\nThe investment avenues provided by post offices are generally non-marketable. \\nMoreover, the major investments in post office enjoy tax concessions also. Post office \\naccepts savings deposits as well as fixed deposits from the public. There is also recurring \\ndeposit scheme which is an instrument of regular monthly savings.\\n Six-year National Savings Certificates (NSC) are issued by post office to investors. \\nThe interest on the amount invested is compounded half-yearly and to payable along with \\nthe principal at the time of maturity which is six years from the date of issue.\\nIndira Vikas Patra and Kissan Vikas Patra are savings certificates issued by post officers.\\nLife Insurance Policies\\nThe Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) offers many investment schemes to investors. \\nThese schemes have the additional facility of life insurance cover. Some of the schemes \\nof LIC are whole Life Polices, Convertible Whole Life Assurance Polices, Endowment \\nAssurance Polices, Jeevan Saathi, Money Back Plan, Jeevan Dhara, Marriage Endownment \\nPlan etc.\\nProvident Fund Schemes\\n Provident fund schemes are compulsory deposit schemes applicable to employees \\nin the public and private sectors. There are three kinds of provident funds applicable to \\ndifferent sectors of employment, namely Statutory Provident Fund, Recognised Provident \\nFund and Unrecognised Provident Fund.'),\n",

This is known as the Public Provident Fund (PPF). \\nAny member of the public can join the scheme which is operated by the post offices and the \\nState Bank of India.\\nGovernment and Semi-Government Securities\\nThe government and semi-Government bodies like the public sector undertakings \\nborrow money from the public through the issue of government securities and public \\nsector bonds. These are less risky avenues of investment because of the credibility of the \\ngovernment and government undertakings.\\n****'),\n",

In the early nineties, the stock market \\nwas the best and safety place for the common individual to invest. Since 1996 the share \\nmarket prices have been low. This made the retail investors to turn away from the stock \\nmarket. The characteristic features of the equity are given in the previous chapter.\\n The stock market classifies shares into Growth shares, Income shares, Defensive \\nshares, Cyclical shares and Speculative shares.\\n1) Growth Shares The stocks that have higher rate of growth than the industrial growth \\nrate in profitability are referred to as growth shares. For example, the list of major \\ngainers for 1996 is dominated by software sector stocks. The HCL and Info systems \\nshare prices increased sharply.\\n2) Income Shares These stocks belong to companies that have comparatively stable \\noperations and limited growth opportunities. The bank shares and some of the fast \\nmoving consumer goods stocks such as Cadburys, Nestle and Hindustan Lever may \\nbe termed as income shares.\\n3) Defensive Shares Defensive stocks are relatively unaffected by the market movements. \\nFor example, a host of pharmaceutical stocks posted returns in excess of 50 per cent \\nin 1998. The pharmaceutical industry owing to its inherent nature of demand is not \\naffected by the down turn in the economy.\\n4) Cyclical Shares The business cycle affects the cyclical shares. The upward and \\ndownward movements of the business cycle affect the business prospects of certain \\ncompanies and their stock prices. Such shares provide low to moderate current yield. \\nCapital gain may be highly variable. For example, the automobile sector stocks are \\naffected by the business cycles.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='13\\n5) Speculative Shares Shares that have lot of speculative trading in them are reffered \\nto as speculative shares. During the bull and bear phases of the market, this type of \\nshares attracts the attention of the trades.\\nThe stocks, which fall under one category in one period, may switch over to another \\ncategory in another period. The classification should not be considered rigid. For example, \\ngrowth shares may be speculative shares.\\nFixed Income Securities\\nI) Preference Shares\\nA detailed description of the preference shares is given in chapter 1. Preference \\nshares are no longer regarded as inferior to the equity capital. Corporate like Siemens has \\nplaced ` 150 Cr. Worth of preference shares. High tax paying companies or investors prefer \\nto subscribe to the preference shares and investors with a low tax burden would prefer to go \\nin for debt instruments. The conversion options provided in the by preference shares also \\nmake it attractive. The biggest advantage is the tax-exempt status of the preference share’s \\ndividend.\\nII) Debentures\\nCorporate debentures are an option available to the investors who are sacrifice \\nliquidity for higher return. Manufacturing companies like Gujarat Industries Power and \\nTISCO have issued debentures. If the debentures are not actively traded in the debt segment \\nof the capital market, the investors may have to hold the instrument till maturity. If the \\ninstruments were actively traded in the secondary market, it would have perhaps changed \\nhands at a considerable premium, thereby lowering the yield on par with the present interest \\nrate. These reasons contribute towards high coupon rates on debentures.\\nIII) Bonds\\nBonds are similar to the debentures but they are issued by the public sector un -\\ndertakings. The value of the bond in the market depends upon the interest rate and the \\nmaturity. The coupon rate is the nominal interest rate offered on the bonds. The coupon \\nrate is contractual involving the terms and conditions of the issuance of the debt security. \\nBeing contractual it cannot be changed during the tenure of the instrument. The investors \\nare not affected by lowering of the bank rates. When the bank rates are lowered, actually,  \\nthe value of the bonds, which are carrying interest rates above the bank rate would appreci -'),\n",

IDBI and ICICI have issued various bonds to suit the needs of the investors. Some of \\nthem are deep discount bond, education benefit bond, retirement benefit bond and index \\nbond.\\nIV) IVPs AND KVPs\\nThese are saving certificates issued by the post office with the name Indira VikasPatra \\n(IVP) and KisanVikasPatra (KVP). The IVPs are in the face value of ` 500, 1000 and 5000. \\nThe KVPs are in the denomination of ` 1000, 5000 and 10000. The capital is doubled in 5.5 \\nyears with the return of 13.47%. IVPs are like bearer bounds, transferable by hand delivery \\nand therefore are attractive to the persons who prefer cash transactions. No income tax \\nconcession is available for this type of investment.\\n6) Government Securities  The securities issued by the Central, State Government \\nand Quasi Government agencies are known as Government securities or gilt edged \\nsecurities. As Government guaranteed security is a claim on the Government, it is a \\nsecured financial instrument, which guarantees the income and the capital. The rate \\nof interest on these securities is relatively lower because of their high liquidity and \\nsafety.\\n7) Money Market Securities  Money market securities have very short term maturity \\nsay less than a year. Common money market instruments are:\\n  ➢ Treasury bills\\n  ➢ Commercial paper\\n  ➢ Certificate of deposit \\nTreasury Bills\\nA treasury bill is basically an instrument of short term borrowing by the Government \\nof India. To develop the Treasury bill market and provide investors with financial instruments \\nof varying short-term maturities and to facilitate the cash management requirements of \\nvarious segments of the economy, in April 1997 treasury bills of varied maturities were \\nintroduced. 14-day Treasury bill on a weekly basis was introduced from June 6, 1997. In the \\nsecond half of 1997-98, Treasury bill of 28-day was introduced on auction basis. Further, \\nit was decided to reintroduced 182-day treasury bills through auctions. Generally, treasury \\nbills are of 91-days. Since the interest rates offered on the offered on the treasury bills are \\nvery low, individuals very rarely invest in them.'),\n",

The maturity period of commercial paper was originally three (minimum) \\nto six (maximum) months from the date of issue. In Oct 1993, the maximum period was \\nextended to one year. The commercial papers are sold at a discount and redeemed at \\ntheir face value. The discounted value implicated the interest rate. The denomination of \\ncommercial paper is high. Mostly the companies and institutional investors favour them. \\nThe minimum maturity of CP was brought down from 3 months to 30 days.\\nCertificate of Deposit\\nThe certificate of deposit is a marketable receipt of funds deposited in a bank for a \\nfixed period at a specified rate of interest. They are bearer documents and readily negotiable. \\nThe denominations of the CD and the interest rate on them are high. It is mainly preferred \\nby institutional investors and companies rather than the individuals. The minimum size of \\nthe certificate is ` 10 lakh. The additional amount is issued in multiples of ` 5 lakh.\\nNon-Negotiable Securities \\nDeposits\\nDeposits earn fixed rate of return. Even though bank deposits resemble fixed income \\nsecurities they are not negotiable instruments. Some of the deposits are dealt subsequently.\\na) Bank Deposits \\nIt is the simple investment avenue open for the investors. He has to open an account \\nand deposit the money. Traditionally the banks offered current account, savings account \\nand fixed deposit account. Current account does not offer any interest rate. The drawback \\nof having large amounts in savings accounts is that the return is just 4.5 per cent. The \\nsavings account interest rate is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and kept low because \\nof the high cost of servicing them. The savings account is more liquid and convenient to \\nhandle. The fixed account carries high interest rate and the money is locked up for a fixed \\nperiod. With increasing competition among the banks, the banks have bundled the plain \\nsavings account with the fixed account to cater to the needs of the small savers.

The NBFCs not having net owned funds of ` 25 lakh are not \\nentitled to accept deposits.\\nc. Internet  NBFCs offer interest rate higher than the commercial bank on public \\ndeposit. The interest rate differs according to maturity period. There is a disparity \\nin the interest rate among the companies in accordance with the credit ratings and \\npolicies of the companies. Even the companies with similar credit ratings provide \\ndifferent interest rates for their deposits. Generally, companies with lower credit \\nratings offer higher interest rates to cover the risk.

To improve the liquidity of NBFCs the percentage of liquid assets required \\nto be maintained by them has been enhanced from 12.5 percent to 15 percent with \\neffect from April 1999 respectively. Company Law Board is authorised to direct the \\ndefaulting NBFCs to repay the deposits. In spite of the strict rules and regulations \\nlaid down by RBI the default rate is high in the case of NBFCs.\\nTax Sheltered Savings Scheme\\nTax sheltered savings schemes are of great importance to the investors in the tax-\\npaying category. The tax sheltered savings schemes offer tax relief to those who participate \\nin their schemes according to the income tax laws. The important tax sheltered savings \\nschemes are\\n  ➢ Public Provident Fund Scheme\\n  ➢ National Savings Scheme\\n  ➢ National Savings Certificate VIII series\\na) Public Provident Fund Scheme (PPF)  \\nPPF earns an interest rate of 12 percent per year, which is exempted from the \\nincome tax under sec 88. The individuals and Hindu undivided families can participate \\nin this scheme. The maximum limit per annum for the deposit is ` 60,000. The interest is \\naccumulated in the deposit. It provides early withdrawal facilities from 7(1 year and every \\nyear thereafter, the account holder has an option to withdraw 50 per cent of the balance \\nto his credit 4 years ago or 1 year ago whichever is lower. The facility makes PPF a self-\\nsustaining account from 71h year onwards.\\nb) National Savings Scheme (NSS)  \\nThis scheme helps in deferring the tax payment. Individuals and 1-IUF are eligible \\nto open NSS account in the designated post office. The NSS-87 gives 100 per cent income \\ntax rebate but the interest as well as the capital are fully taxable if withdrawn during  \\ntheir lifetime. Investments in the NSS scheme, with a lock in period of 4 years qualify  \\nfor a rebate of 20 per cent under Section 88 of the Income Tax Act, subject to a maximum \\nof ` 12,000. The investment also earns an interest rate of 11 per cent pr year covered by  \\nSec 80L. Compared to other tax savings’ instruments the return offered by this scheme is \\nlower.'),\n",

The entire amount can be \\nwithdrawn. The account can be closed on the expiry of 4 years. There is no fixed tenure for \\ninvestment. One can also keep the account alive and earn interest at 11 percent per annum.\\nAs a tax saving instrument “anytime” withdrawal after 4 years is the only interesting \\nfeature to the prospective investor. The tax deduction at source at the rate of 20 percent on \\nthe entire amount withdrawn has proved too costly to the investors.\\nc) National Savings Certificate (NSC)\\nThis scheme is offered by the post office. These certificates come in the denominations \\nof ` 500, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000. The contribution and the interest for the first 5 years are \\ncovered by Sec 88. The interest is cumulative at the rate of 12% per annum and payable \\nbiannually is covered by Sec 80L. No withdrawals are permitted. There is no deduction at \\nmaturity.\\nLife Insurance\\nLife insurance is a contract for payment of a sum of money to the person assured \\n(or to the person entitled to receive the same) on the happening of event insured against. \\nUsually the contract provides for the payment of an amount on the date of maturity or at \\nspecified dates at periodic intervals or if unfortunate death occurs. Among other things, the \\ncontracts also provide for the payment of premium periodically to the corporation by the \\npolicy holders. Life insurance eliminates risk. \\nThe major advantages of life insurance are given below:\\ni) Protection  Saving through life insurance guarantees full protection against risk of \\ndeath of the saver. The full assured sum is paid, whereas in other schemes only the \\namount saved is paid.\\nii) Easy Payments  For the salaried people the salary savings’ schemes are introduced. \\nFurther, there is an easy instalment facility method of payment through monthly, \\nquarterly, half yearly or yearly mode.\\niii) Liquidity  Loans can be raised on the security of the policy.\\niv) Tax Relief Tax relief in Income Tax and Wealth Tax is available for amounts paid by \\nway of premium for life insurance subject to the tax rates in force.'),\n",

The funds collected from the investors are placed under \\nprofessional management for the benefit of the investors. The mutual funds are broadly \\nclassified into open-ended scheme and close-ended scheme.\\nOpen-Ended Schemes\\nThe open-ended scheme offers its units on a continuous basis and accepts funds \\nfrom investors continuously. Repurchase is carried out on a continuing basis thus, helping \\nthe investors to withdraw their money at any time. In other words, there is an uninterrupted \\nentry and exit into the funds. The open-end scheme has no maturity period and they are not \\nlisted into stock exchanges. Investor can deal directly with the mutual fund for investment \\nas well as redemption. The open-ended fund provides liquidity to the investors since the \\nrepurchase facility is available. Repurchase price is fixed on the basis of net asset value of \\nthe unit. In 1998 the open-ended schemes have crossed 80 in number.\\nClosed – Ended Funds\\nThe close-ended funds have a fixed maturity period. The first time investments are \\nmade when the close end scheme is kept open for a limited period. Once closed, the units \\nare listed on a stock exchange. Investors can buy and sell their units only through stock \\nexchanges. The demand and supply factors influence the prices of the units. The investor’s \\nexpectation also affects the unit prices. The market price may not be the same as the net \\nasset value.\\n Sometimes mutual funds with the features of close-ended and open-ended schemes \\nare launched, known as interval funds. They can be listed in the stock exchange or may be \\navailable for repurchase during specific periods at net asset value or related prices.'),\n",

Some of them are given below\\ni) Growth Scheme Aims to provide capital appreciation over medium to long term. \\nGenerally these funds invest their money in equities.\\nii) Income Scheme This scheme aims to provide a regular return to its unit holders. \\nMostly these funds deploy their funds in fixed income securities.\\niii) Balanced Scheme A combination of steady return as well as reasonable growth. The \\nfunds of these schemes are invested in equities and debt instruments.\\niv) Money Market Scheme This type of fund invests its money on money market \\ninstruments like treasury bills, commercial paper, etc.\\nv) Tax Saving Schemes  This type of scheme offers tax rebates to investors. Equity \\nlinked savings schemes and pension schemes provide exemption from capital gains \\non specific investment.\\nvi) Index Scheme Here investment is made on the equities of the index. Benchmark \\nindex is BSE sensex or NSE-50. The return are approximately equal to the return on \\nthe index.\\nReal Assets\\nGold and Silver\\nFor ages, gold and silver have been considered as a form of investment. They are \\nconsidered as best hedge against inflation. This is a favourite form of investment amongst \\nthe rural and semi-urban population. Besides, investors tend to invest in jewellery instead \\nof pure gold. As a result, when they buy jewellery, the price realization is usually less than \\ntotal purchase price (this is due to higher making charge of jewellery). The price of gold \\nhas declined in the later part of the nineties. Gold prices are suppressed because of large \\nsupplies overtaking the demand. The government has allowed imports of gold to certain \\nbanks and agencies and they have huge stocks of gold. The gold prices remained depressed \\nin the international markets too in the late nineties. The following reasons are cited for the \\nlow price of gold in the international market.\\ni) Weak demand from Asian countries which are the largest consumers of gold.\\nii) Continuing pressure on central banks to dishoard gold'),\n",

The substantial increase in domestic demand for gold was met by ease \\nof supply facilities by (i) allowing non-resident Indians to import 10kg. of gold (as against \\n5kg. earlier) once in every six months with effect from January 1, 1997, (ii) allowing 12 \\nauthorised agencies to import gold under Open General Licence (OGL) without any limit \\non quantity and sell it in the local market against rupees after payment of approximately \\n5 percent duty and (iii) lower prices in the international market.

They are optimistic about the rise in silver price.\\nReal Estate\\nThe real estate market offers a high return to the investors. The word real estate \\nmeans land and buildings. There is a normal notion that the price of the real estate has \\nincreased by more than 12 percent over the past ten years. The population growth and the \\nexodus of people towards the urban cities have made the prices to increase manifold. The \\nprice of the residential area land generally in South Mumbai ranges from a high of ` 19,400 \\nper sq.ft. at Kemps Corner to a low of ` 8,400 per sq.ft. at Cuffe Parke in 1998. Recently, \\nthe recession in the economy has affected the price of the real estate. Prices, marked a \\nsubstantial fall in 1998 from the 1997 prices. Reasons for investing in real estate are give \\nbelow:\\n1. High capital appreciation compared to gold or silver particularly in the urban area. \\n2. Availability of loans for the construction of houses. The 1999-2000 budget provides \\nhuge incentives to the middle class to avail of housing loans. Scheduled banks now \\nhave to disburse 3 percent of their incremental deposits in housing finance.\\n3. Tax rebate is given to the interest paid on the housing loan. Further ` 75,000 tax \\nrebate on a loan upto ` 5 lakhs which is availed of after April 1999. If an invests in \\na house for about ` 6-7 lakh, he provides a seed capital of about ` 1-2 lakh. The ` 5 \\nlakh loan, which draws an interest rate of 15 percent, will work out to be less than 9.6 \\npercent because of the ` 75,000 exempted from tax annually. In assessing the wealth \\ntax, the value of the residential home is estimated at its historical cost and not on its \\npresent market value.\\n4. The possession of a house gives an investor a psychologically secure feeling and a \\nstanding among his friends and relatives.\\nApart from making investment in the residential houses, the people in the higher \\nincome bracket invest their money in time share plans of the holiday resorts and land \\nsituated near the city limit with the anticipation of a capital appreciation. Farm houses and \\nplantations also fall in the line. In spite of the fast capital appreciation investors generally do \\nnot invest in the real estate apart from owning one or two houses. The reasons are:\\nRequirement of Huge Capital:  To purchase a land or house in the urban area, the \\ninvestor needs money in lakhs whereas he can buy equity, gold or other form of \\ninvestment by investing thousands of rupees.'),\n",

The waiting period may be months or years.\\nThe points to be taken care of while purchasing the real estate are:\\n1. The plots should be approved by the local authority because on the unapproved \\nlayout construction of a house is not permitted.\\n2. Possibility of capital appreciation- It depends upon the locality and other facilities \\nof the site.\\n3. Originality of title deeds- The site should be free from encumbrance. Encumbrance \\ncertificate for a minimum period of latest 15 years should be got from the Registrars \\nOffice.\\n4. Plinth area should be verified.\\n5. Credibility of the broker\\n The role of broker cannot be undermined because it is he who introduces to the \\nparties and location of site. He should be faithful and loyal otherswise the investor finds \\nhimself in trouble.\\nArt\\nPaintings are most sought after form of art. The price in the art market are rising \\nand this rise is expected to continue. The trend in the market today is to invest in young \\nupcoming painters whose prices will soar over the years.

Paintings of the young painters - The works of established painters are costly and \\nscope for appreciation in their values are limited. But prices of the good quality \\npaintings of the young painters may increase quickly.\\n2. Should possess the basic idea of the painting - This is needed to decide the quality \\nof the paintings. He should be able to judge the primary attributes of the paintings \\nsuch as spontaneity, nature of strokes, colour combination and originality.\\n3. The investor should have aestheticsense -because he may or may not be able to \\nresell the paintings.

It may be a coin, sculpture, manuscript \\nor any other object of olden days. The owner of the antique has to register himself with \\nArcheological Society of India. The society after examining the authenticity of the antique \\nissues a “Certificate of registration” . Any dealings I.e. purchase and sale of antique should be \\ninformed to the society. The government has the right to buy the antique from the owner, if \\nit wants to keep it in the museum. In the case of investment, the investor has to be careful \\nabout the fake antique and the risk in the price of the antique is uncertain.\\n****'),\n",

These are traded in the securities market. Creation of a portfolio and \\nperiodic revision of the portfolio involves buying and selling of securities in the securities \\nmarket. An understanding of the working of securities market is, therefore, essential for \\npracticing portfolio management. However, the functioning of the securities market is too \\nvast a subject to be confined within a single chapter. An attempt is made in this chapter to \\nexplain the basic features of securities market.\\nFinancial Market\\nA market is a place used for buying and selling goods. This is the commonest meaning \\nof the word ‘market’ . The usual features of a market are a place, some buyers, some sellers, \\nsome commodity to be exchanged for money or some other commodity. What transpires \\nin a market is an exchange of a commodity between a buyer and a seller. However, such an \\nexchange can take place even without a common meeting place or physical space. Hence, \\na physical place is not an essential constituent of a market. It is rather the mechanism used \\nfor the exchange of goods.\\nIn an ordinary market what is usually exchanged is a physical commodity such as \\nfruits, grains, etc. In modern day markets, these commodities are valued in monetary terms \\nand exchanged for money. A commodity that is in demand is exchanged between buyers \\nand sellers in the market.\\nIn an economy, the various economic units such as individuals in the household \\nsector, business units in the industrial and commercial sector, and government organisations \\nand departments in the government sector are engaged in various economic activities and \\ntransactions involving money. Some of them spend more money than they earn and end \\nup in financial deficit while others earn more money than they spend, thus ending up in \\nfinancial surplus. The deficit generators are usually the units in the industrial, commercial \\nand government sectors. The surplus generators are mostly the units in the household \\nsector. The deficit generators who are known as ultimate borrowers would like to borrow \\nfunds from the surplus generators who are the primary lenders. Such transfer of funds is \\npossible and also necessary to sustain the development of the economy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='28\\nThe transfer of funds between primary lenders and ultimate borrowers takes place \\nthrough the creation of securities or financial assets. If an individual is not spending all \\nhis income on consumption, he will want to find a temporary repository for his current \\nsavings until they are required to finance future consumption. This involves the purchase \\nof a financial asset or security. If the investor deposits the money in the fixed deposit of a \\ncommercial bank, the bank issues him a fixed deposit receipt which is a financial asset. The \\nindividual is purchasing a financial asset and thereby transferring the surplus funds at his \\ndisposal to a financial intermediary. The bank, in turn, may lend the money to a business \\nunit through the creation of a loan agreement.\\nLet us consider another instance of transfer of funds. A company in need of funds \\nmay issue shares to mobilize funds. In a public issue of shares, any individual with surplus \\nfunds may participate. If shares are allotted to such an individual, the company which is the \\nborrower of funds will issue a share certificate to the investor who is the lender of funds. In \\nsuch a situation a financial asset in the form of a share certificate is being exchanged. This \\nexchange represents a marketing transaction and presupposes a market which nevertheless \\nhas no physical location. \\nThe commodity being exchanged is a financial asset instead of a physical asset. The \\nlender of funds (or investor) is the buyer of the asset and the borrower of funds is the seller \\nof the asset (or issuer of the security). The mechanism or system through which financial \\nassets are created and transferred is known as the financial market. When the financial \\nassets transferred are corporate securities and government securities, the mechanism of \\ntransfer is known as securities market.\\nSegments of Financial Market\\nDifferent types of securities are traded in the securities market. These may \\ninclude ownership securities, debt securities, short-term securities, long-term securities, \\ngovernment securities, non-government or corporate securities. The nature of return and \\nrisk involved in short-term securities is vastly different from that of long-term securities. \\nHence, on the basis of the maturity period of securities traded in the market, the securities \\nmarket is segmented into money market and capital market. \\nMoney market is the market for short-term financial assets with maturities of one \\nyear or less. Treasury bills, commercial bills, commercial paper, certificate of deposit, etc. \\nare the short-term securities traded in the money market. These instruments being close \\nsubstitutes for money, the market for their trading is known as money market.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='29\\nMoney market is the main source of working capital funds for business and industry. \\nIt provides a mechanism for evening out short-term surpluses and deficits. The short-term \\nrequirements of borrowers can be met by the creation of money market securities, which can \\nbe purchased by lenders with short-term surpluses to park their funds for short durations. \\nIn India, the money market has a narrow base with limited number of participants who are \\nmostly financial institutions.\\nCapital market, on the other hand, is the market segment where securities with \\nmaturities of more than one year are bought and sold. Equity shares, preference shares, \\ndebentures and bonds are the long-term securities traded in the capital market. The capital \\nmarket is the source of long-term funds for business and industry.\\nTypes of Financial Market\\nThe financial market may be classified as primary market or secondary market \\ndepending on whether the securities traded are newly issued securities or securities already \\noutstanding and owned by investors. Private companies and public sector enterprises, in \\nneed of money, may issue securities such as shares, debentures, bonds, commercial papers, \\netc. to raise required capital. Individual investors and institutional investors may invest in \\nthese securities. The market mechanism for the buying and selling of new issues of securities \\nis known as primary market. This market is also termed as new issues market because it \\ndeals in new issues of securities.\\nThe secondary market, on the other hand, deals with securities which have already \\nbeen issued and are owned by investors, both individual and institutional. These may be \\ntraded between investors. The buying and selling of securities already issued and outstanding \\ntake place in stock exchanges. Hence, stock exchanges constitute the secondary market in \\nsecurities.\\nParticipants in the Financial Market\\nA financial market is essentially a system by which financial securities are exchanged. \\nThis system is composed of participants, securities, markets, trading arrangements and \\nregulations. The major participants are the buyers and sellers of securities or the investors \\n(who are the buyers of securities) and the issuers (who are the sellers of securities). Financial \\nintermediaries are the second major class of participants in the financial system. They play \\na crucial role in the smooth functioning of the financial system. The investors who are the \\nprimary lenders in the financial system would prefer to ‘lend short’ , that is, invest their \\nsurplus for short durations as they generally have a preference for liquidity. On the contrary, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='30\\nthe issuers of securities who are the ultimate borrowers would prefer to ‘borrow long’ , that \\nis, borrow for long durations as the funds are generally required for financing long-term \\ninvestment in fixed assets. This situation gives rise to a fundamental problem in the financial \\nsystem which was described as the ‘constitutional weakness’ of unintermediated financial \\nmarkets by Hicks (1939). ’ The problem is to match the preferences of the surplus sector to \\nlend short with those of the deficit sector to borrow long. It is the financial intermediaries \\nwho resolve this problem. They borrow for short durations from the primary lenders and \\nlend for long durations to the ultimate borrowers. Through the intervention of the financial \\nintermediaries, the ultimate borrower is able to get long-term funding and the primary \\nlender is able to get liquidity on his lending.\\nThere are two types of financial intermediaries in the financial system, namely \\nbanking financial intermediaries and non-banking financial intermediaries such as insurance \\ncompanies, housing finance companies, unit trusts and investment companies. However, it \\nmay be noted that the traditional distinction between banking and non-banking institutions \\nisslowly disappearing. As a result of technological innovations and increasing competitive \\npressures, the traditional distinction between banking and non-banking activities is rapidly \\ndisappearing and a universal banking system in which a single institution provides the \\ncomplete range of financial intermediation services is slowly emerging.\\nAnother group of participants in the financial system comprises the individuals \\nand institutions who facilitate the trading or exchange process in the system. They are \\nprimarily brokers who act as agents for the primary lenders or the ultimate borrowers in the \\npurchase or sale of securities. There are also broker dealers who act on their own account by \\nbuying and selling securities for a profit. This group also includes institutions which act as \\nregistrars, managers, lead managers, share transfer agents, etc. at the time of issue of shares \\nby companies.\\nRegulatory Environment\\nThe financial system in a country is subject to a set of regulations in the form of \\nvarious Acts passed by the legislative bodies. The regulatory environment may differ from \\none country to another. In each country, the regulatory control of the financial system \\nis exercised by designated regulatory authorities. In India, the Ministry of Finance, the \\nReserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), etc. are the \\nmajor regulatory bodies exercising regulatory control and supervision over the functioning \\nof the financial system in the country.\\nA simple diagrammatic representation of how a security is raised or originated in \\nthe financial market is attempted in Fig.'),\n",

Let us analyse the functioning of this primary \\nmarket.\\nPrimary Market/New Issues Market\\nWhen a new company is floated, its shares are issued to the public in the primary \\nmarket as an Initial Public Offer (IPO). If the company subsequently decides to include \\ndebt in its capital structure by issuing bonds or debentures, these may also be floated in \\nthe primary market. Similarly, when a company decides to expand its activities using either \\nequity finance or bond finance, the additional shares or bonds may be floated in the primary \\nmarket.\\nThe primary market or new issues market (NIM) does not have a physical structure \\nor form. All the agencies which provide the facilities and participate in the process of selling \\nnew issues to the investors constitute the NIM.\\nThe NIM has three functions to perform. They are:\\n1. Origination\\n2. Underwriting\\n3. Distribution.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='32\\nOrigination\\nOrigination is the preliminary work in connection with the floatation of a new issue \\nby a company. It deals with assessing the feasibility of the project, technical, economic and \\nfinancial, as also making all arrangements for the actual floatation of the issue. As part of\\nthe origination work, decisions may have to be taken on the following issues: \\n1. Time of floating the issue\\n2. Type of issue\\n3. Price of the issue.\\nTiming of the issue is crucial for its success. The floatation of the issue should \\ncoincide with the buoyant mood in the investment market to ensure proper support and \\nsubscription to the issue. The type of issue whether equity, preference, debentures or \\nconvertible securities, has to be properly analysed at the time of origination work. Pricing of \\nthe issue is a sensitive matter, as the public support to a new issue will depend on the price \\nof the issue to a large extent. In the primary market, the price of the security is determined \\nby the issuer and not by the market. New issues are made either at par or at premium. Well- \\nestablished companies may be able to sell their shares at a premium at the time of a new \\nissue. Further, the pricing of new issues is also regulated by the guidelines on capital issues \\nissued by SEBI.\\nThe origination function in the NIM is now being carried out by merchant bankers. \\nIn the 1980s, commercial banks in India created special divisions called merchant banking \\ndivisions to perform the origination function for floatation of new issues. But now there are \\nseparate institutions registered with SEBI as merchant bankers.\\nUnderwriting\\nThe second function performed by NIM is underwriting which is the activity \\nof providing a guarantee to the issuer to ensure successful marketing of the issue. An \\nunderwriter is an individual or institution which gives an undertaking to the stock issuing \\ncompany to purchase a specified number of shares of the company in the event of a shortfall \\nin subscription to the new issue. The stock issuing company can thus ensure full subscription \\nto the new issue through underwriting agreements with different underwriters, even if there \\nis no proper response to the new issue from the investors. Underwriting activity in the NIM \\nis performed by large financial institutions such as LIC, UTI, IDBI, IFCI, general insurance \\ncompanies, commercial banks and also by brokers. The underwriters earn commission \\nfrom the issuing company for this activity.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='33\\nDistribution\\nThe new issue market performs a third function besides the functions of origination \\nand underwriting. This third function is that of distribution of shares. The distribution \\nfunction is carried out by brokers, sub-brokers and agents. New issues have to be publicised \\nby using different mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, radio, Internet, \\netc. New issues are also publicized by mass mailing. It has become a general practice to \\ndistribute prospectus, application forms and other literature regarding new issues among \\nthe investing public.\\nMethods of Floating New Issues\\nThe methods by which new issues of shares are floated in the primary market in India are:\\n1. Public issue\\n2. Rights issue\\n3. Private placement.\\nPublic Issue\\nPublic issue involves sale of securities to members of the public. The issuing company \\nmakes an offer for sale to the public directly of a fixed number of shares at a specific price. \\nThe offer is made through a legal document called Prospectus. Thus a public issue is an \\ninvitation by a company to the public to subscribe to the securities offered through a \\nprospectus. Public issues are mostly underwritten by strong public financial institutions. \\nThis is the most popular method for floating securities in the new issue market, but it \\ninvolves an elaborate process and consequently it is an expensive method. The company \\nhas to incur expenses on various activities such as advertisements, printing of prospectus, \\nbanks’ commissions, underwriting commissions, agents’ fees, legal charges, etc.\\nRights Issue\\nThe rights issue involves selling of securities to the existing shareholders in proportion \\nto their current holding. As per section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956, when a company \\nissues additional equity capital it has to be offered first to the existing shareholders on a \\npro rata basis. However, the shareholders may forfeit this special right by passing a special \\nresolution and thereby enable the company to issue additional capital to the public through \\na public issue. Rights issue is an inexpensive method of floatation of shares as the offer is \\nmade through a formal letter to the existing shareholders.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='34\\nPrivate Placement\\nA private placement is a sale of securities privately by a company to a selected group \\nof investors. The securities are normally placed, in a private placement, with the institutional \\ninvestors, mutual funds or other financial institutions. The terms of the issue are negotiated \\nbetween the company and the investors. A formal prospectus is not necessary in the case of \\nprivate placement. Underwriting arrangements are also not required in private placement, \\nas the sale is directly negotiated with the investors. This method is useful to small companies \\nand closely held companies for issue of new securities, because such companies are unlikely \\nto get good response from the investing public for their public issues. They can avoid the \\nexpenses of a public issue and also have their shares sold.\\nPrincipal Steps in Floating a Public Issue\\nIn a public issue, investors are allowed to subscribe to the shares being issued by the \\ncompany during a specified period ranging from a minimum of three days to a maximum \\nof ten days. The issue remains open during this period for subscription by the public. This \\nis the principal activity in the process of a public issue. Before the issue is opened for public \\nsubscription, several activities/ legal formalities have to be completed. These are the pre-\\nissue steps or obligations. Similarly, after the issue is closed, several activities are to be \\ncarried out to complete the process of public issue. These activities may be designated as \\nthe post-issue tasks. Thus, we can identify three distinct stages in the successful completion \\nof a public issue.\\n1. Pre-issue tasks\\n2. Opening and closing of the issue\\n3. Post-issue tasks.\\nPre-Issue Tasks\\nThese are the preparatory obligations to be complied with before the actual opening \\nof the issue.\\nDrafting and finalisation of the prospectus Prospectus  is an essential document in \\na public issue. The Companies Act 1956 defines a prospectus as: “ Any document described \\nor issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document \\ninviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or \\npurchase of any shares in or debentures of a body corporate” . It is the offer document which \\ncontains all the information pertaining to the company which will be useful to the investors '),\n",

It is a communication \\nfrom the issuer to the investor. The prospectus contains detailed information about the \\ncompany, its activities, promoters, directors, group companies, capital structure, terms of \\nthe present issue, details of proposed project, details regarding underwriting arrangements, \\netc. SEBI has issued guidelines regarding the contents of the prospectus and these have to \\nbe complied with by the company.\\nThe draft prospectus has to be approved by the Board of Directors of the company. \\nThe draft prospectus has also to be filed with SEBI and the Registrar of companies. The \\nfinal prospectus has to be prepared as per the suggestions of SEBI and filed with SEBI and \\nthe Registrar of companies.\\nSelecting the intermediaries and entering into agreements with them  Several \\nintermediaries are involved in the process of a public issue. These intermediaries have to be \\nregistered with SEBI. Important categories of intermediaries are the following:\\n1. Merchant Banker:  Merchant banker is any person or institution which is engaged \\nin the business of issue management either as manager, consultant, adviser, or by \\nrendering corporate advisory service in relation to such issue management. Merchant \\nbankers play an important role in the process of managing a public issue. It is the \\nduty of the merchant bankers to ensure correctness of the information furnished \\nin the prospectus as well as to ensure compliance with SEBI rules, regulations and \\nguidelines regarding public issue of securities. Merchant bankers are registered with \\nSEBI in four categories, with different eligibility criteria for each category.\\n2. Registrar to an Issue:  Registrar to an issue is any person or institution entrusted \\nwith the following functions in connection with a public issue:\\n(a) Collecting applications from investors.\\n(b) Keeping a record of applications and monies received from investors\\n(c) Assisting the stock issuing company in determining the basis of allotment of \\nsecurities in consultation with the stock exchange.\\n(d) Finalising the list of persons entitled to allotment of securities.\\n(e) Processing and despatching allotment letters, refund orders, certificates and \\nother related documents.\\n3. Share Transfer Agent:  Share transfer agent is a person or institution which maintains \\nthe records of holders of securities of a company on behalf of that company. The \\nshare transfer agent is authorised to effect the transfer of securities as well as the \\nredemption of securities wherever applicable.'),\n",

BANKER TO AN ISSUE:  Banker to an issue is a scheduled bank entrusted with the \\nfollowing activities in connection with a public issue:\\n(a) Acceptance of application and application monies\\n(b) Acceptance of allotment or call monies\\n(c) Refund of application monies\\n(d) Payment of dividend or interest warrants.\\nThe intermediaries are service providers possessing professional expertise in the \\nrelevant areas of operation. The market regulator, SEBI, regulates the various intermediaries \\nin the primary market through its regulations for these intermediaries. \\nSEBI has defined the role of each category of intermediary, the eligibility criteria for \\ngranting registration, their functions and responsibilities, and the code of conduct to which \\nthey are bound.\\nThe stock issuing company has to select the intermediaries such as merchant banker, \\nregistrar to the issue, share transfer agent, banker to the issue, underwriters, etc. and sign \\nseparate agreements with each of them to engage them for the public issue.\\nAttending to Other Formalities  \\nThe prospectus and application forms have to be printed and despatched to all \\nintermediaries and brokers for wide circulation among the investing public. An initial \\nlisting application has to be filed with the stock exchange where the issue is proposed to be \\nlisted. An abridged version of the prospectus along with the issue opening and closing dates \\nhas to be published in newspapers.\\nOpening and Closing of The Issue  \\nThe public issue is open for subscription by the public on the pre-announced \\nopening date. The application forms and application monies are received at the branches of \\nthe bankers to the issue and forwarded by these bankers to the Registrar to the issue. Two \\nclosing dates are prescribed for the closing of the public issue. \\nThe first of these is the ‘earliest closing date’ which should not be less than three days \\nfrom the opening date. If sufficient applications are received by the company, the company \\nmay choose to close the issue on the earliest closing date itself. The other closing date is the \\nfinal or latest closing date which shall not exceed ten days from the opening date.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='37\\nPost-Issue Tasks\\nAfter closing of the public issue, several activities are to be carried out to complete \\nthe process of public issue. They are:\\n1. All the application forms received have to be scrutinised, processed and tabulated.\\n2. When the issue is not fully subscribed to, it becomes the liability of the underwriters \\nto subscribe to the shortfall. The liability of each underwriter has to be determined.\\n3. When the issue is oversubscribed, the basis of allotment has to be decided in \\nconsultation with the stock exchange.\\n4. Allotment letters and share certificates have to be despatched to the allottees. Refund \\norders have to be despatched to the applicants whose applications are rejected.\\n5. Shares have to be listed in the stock exchange for trading. For this purpose. the \\nissuing company has to enter into a listing agreement with the stock exchange.\\nBook Building\\nCompanies may raise capital in the primary market by way of public issue, rights \\nissue or private placement. A public issue is the selling of securities to the public in the \\nprimary market. The usual procedure of a public issue is through the fixed price method \\nwhere securities are offered for subscription to the public at a fixed price. An alternative \\nmethod is now available which is known as the book building process. Although book \\nbuilding has been a common practice in most of the developed countries, the concept is \\nrelatively new in India. SEBI announced guidelines for the book building process, for the \\nfirst time, in October 1995.\\nUnder the book building process, the issue price is not fixed in advance. It is \\ndetermined by the offer of potential investors about the price which they are willing to pay \\nfor the issue. The price of the security is determined as the weighted average at which the \\nmajority of investors are willing to buy the security. Thus, under the book building process, \\nthe issue price of a security is determined by the demand and supply forces in the capital \\nmarket.\\nSEBI guidelines define book building as: “ A process undertaken by which a demand \\nfor the securities proposed to be issued by a body corporate is elicited and built up and the \\nprice for such securities is assessed for the determination of the quantum of such securities \\nto be issued by means of a notice, circular, advertisement, document or information \\nmemoranda or offer document” .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='38\\nBook building is a process of price discovery. It puts in place a pricing mechanism \\nwhereby new securities are valued on the basis of the demand feedback following a period \\nof marketing. It is an alternative to the existing system of fixed pricing.\\nA public issue of securities may be made through the fixed price method, the book \\nbuilding method, or a combination of both. In case the issuing company chooses to issue \\nsecurities through the book building route, then as per SEBI guidelines the issuer company \\ncan select any of the following methods:\\n1. 100 per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process.\\n2. Seventy-five per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process \\nand twenty-five per cent through the fixed price method at the price determined \\nthrough book building.\\n3. Ninety per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process and ten \\nper cent through the fixed price method.\\nThe issue of the fixed price portion is conducted like a normal public issue after the \\nbook built portion is issued.\\nThe steps involved in the process of book building may be listed out as follows:\\n1. The issuer appoints a merchant banker as the lead manager and book runner to the \\nissue.\\n2. The book runner forms a syndicate of underwriters. The syndicate consists of book \\nrunner, lead manager, joint lead managers, advisors, co-managers and underwriting \\nmembers.\\n3. A draft prospectus is submitted to SEBI without a price or price band. The draft \\nprospectus is then circulated among eligible investors with a price band arrived at \\nby the book runner in consultation with the issuer. Such a prospectus is known as a \\nRed Herring prospectus.\\n4. The book runner conducts awareness campaigns, which include advertising, road \\nshows and conferences.\\n5. Investors place their orders with syndicate members. These members collect orders \\nfrom their clients on the amount of securities required by them as well as the price \\nthey are willing to pay.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='39\\n6. The book runner builds up a record known as Book after receiving orders from \\nmembers of the syndicate. He maintains detailed records in this regard. The book \\nis thus built up to the size of the portion to be raised through the book building \\nprocess. When the book runner receives substantial number of orders, he announces \\nclosure of the book. A book should remain open for a minimum of three working \\ndays. The maximum period for which the bidding process may be allowed is seven \\nworking days.\\n7. On the basis of the offers received, the book runner and the issuer company then \\ndetermines the price at which the securities shall be sold.\\n8. The book runner finalises the allocation to syndicate members. Procurement \\nagreements are signed between issuer and the syndicate members for the subscription \\nto be procured by them.\\nThe final prospectus along with the procurement agreements is then filed with the \\nRegistrar of companies within two days of the determination of the offer price.\\n9. The book runner collects from the institutional buyers and the underwriters the \\napplication forms along with the application monies to the extent of the securities \\nproposed to be allotted to them/subscribed by them.\\nBook building is a process wherein the issuer of securities asks investors to bid for \\ntheir securities at different prices. These bids should be within an indicative price band \\ndecided by the issuer. Here investors bid for different quantity of shares at different prices. \\nConsidering these bids, issuer determines the price at which the securities are to be allotted. \\nThus, the issuer gets the best possible price for his securities as perceived by the market or \\ninvestors.\\nRole of Primary Market\\nPrimary market is the medium for raising fresh capital in the form of equity and \\ndebt. It mops up resources from the public (investors) and makes them available for meeting \\nthe long-term capital requirements of corporate business and industry. The primary \\nmarket brings together the two principal constituents of the market, namely the investors \\nand the seekers of capital. The savings or surplus funds with the investors are converted \\ninto productive capital to be used by companies for productive purposes. Thus, capital \\nformation takes place in the primary market. The economic growth of a country is possible \\nonly through a robust and vibrant primary market.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='40\\nIn the secondary market, shares already purchased by investors are traded among \\nother investors. Operations in the secondary market do not result in the accretion of capital \\nresources of the country, but indirectly promotes savings and investments by providing \\nliquidity to the investments in securities, i.e. the investors have the facility to liquidate their \\ninvestments in securities in the secondary market.\\nRegulation of Primary Market\\nFor companies, raising capital through the primary market is time consuming and \\nexpensive. The issuer has to engage the services of a number of intermediaries and comply \\nwith complex legal and other formalities. The investor faces much risk while operating \\nin the primary market. Fraudulent promoters may try to dupe the investors who opt to \\ninvest in a new issue. Investors in the primary market need protection from such fraudulent \\noperators.\\nUp to 1992, the primary market was controlled by the Controller of Capital Issues \\n(CCI) appointed under the Capital Issues Control Act, 1947. During that period, the pricing \\nof capital issues was regulated by CCI. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \\nwas formed under the SEBI Act, 1992, with the prime objective of protecting the interests \\nof investors in securities as well as for promoting and regulating the securities market. \\nAll public issues since January 1992 are governed by the rules, regulations and guidelines \\nissued by SEBI.\\nSEBI has been instrumental in bringing greater transparency in capital issues. It \\nhas issued detailed guidelines to standardise disclosure obligations of companies issuing \\nsecurities. Companies floating pubic issues are now required to disclose all relevant \\ninformation affecting investors’ interests. SEBI constantly reviews its guidelines to make \\nthem more market friendly and investor friendly.\\nSuccessful floatation of a new issue in the primary market requires careful planning, \\nproper timing and comprehensive marketing efforts. The services of specialised institutions \\nsuch as merchant bankers, registrars to the issue, underwriters, etc. are available to the \\nissuer company to handle the task. There is effective regulation of SEBI at every stage of a \\npublic issue. There are also regulations to ensure fair practice by the intermediaries in the \\nmarket.\\n****'),\n",

Secondary market is the market in which securities \\nalready issued by companies are subsequently traded among investors. A person with funds \\nfor investment in securities may purchase the securities either in the primary market (from \\nthe issuing company at the time of a new issue of securities) or from the secondary market \\n(from other investors holding the desired securities). Securities can be purchased in the \\nprimary market only at the time of issue of the security by the company, whereas in the \\nsecondary market securities can be purchased throughout the year. As a result, trading \\nin a particular security in the primary market is an intermittent event depending upon \\nthe frequency of new issues of the security by the company, but trading in that security in \\nthe secondary market is continuous. The secondary market where continuous trading in \\nsecurities takes place is the stock exchange. In this chapter we shall examine the functioning \\nof stock exchanges in the country.\\nWhat is a Stock Exchange\\nThe stock exchanges were once physical market places where the agents of \\nbuyers and sellers operated through the auction process. These are being replaced with \\nelectronic exchanges where buyers and sellers are connected only by computers over a \\ntelecommunications network. Auction trading is giving way to “screen-based” trading, \\nwhere bid prices and offer prices (or ask prices) are displayed on the computer screen. Bid \\nprice refers to the price at which an investor is willing to buy the security and offer price \\nrefers to the price at which an investor is willing to sell the security. Alternatively, a dealer \\nin securities may declare the bid price and the offer price of a security, suggesting the price \\nat which he is prepared to buy the security (bid price) and also the price at which he is \\nprepared to sell the security (offer price). The bid-offer spread, the difference between the \\nbid price and the offer price constitutes his margin or profit.\\nSecurities of a company first become available on an exchange after the company \\nconducts its Initial Public Offering (IPO). During the IPO, a company sells it securities \\nto an initial set of investors in the primary market. These securities can then be sold and \\npurchased in the stock exchanges. The exchange tracks the flow of orders for each security, \\nand this flow of supply and demand for the security sets the price of the security.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='42\\nA stock exchange may be defined or described in different ways. A simple description \\nof a stock exchange is as follows: “ A centralised market for buying and selling stocks where \\nthe price is determined through supply-demand mechanisms” .\\nA somewhat similar description of a stock exchange is the following: “ An organisation \\nthat provides a facility for buyers and sellers of listed securities to come together to make \\ntrades in these securities” .\\nIn a stock exchange, the trading in listed securities is carried out by qualified members \\nwho may act either as agents for customers or as principals for their own accounts. \\nStock exchanges may, therefore, be described as “ Associations of brokers and dealers \\nin securities who transact business together” .\\nA more descriptive definition of a stock exchange is: “ An organised market place for \\nsecurities featured by the centralisation of supply and demand for the transaction of orders \\nby member brokers for institutional and individual investors” .\\nAccording to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which is the main law \\ngoverning stock exchanges in India, “stock exchange means any body of individuals, whether \\nincorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or controlling the \\nbusiness of buying, selling or dealing in securities” .\\nFunctions of Stock Exchanges\\nA stock exchange has an important role to fulfil in the economic development of a \\ncountry. It is essential for the smooth functioning of the private sector corporate economy. \\nIn the process of capital formation and in’raising resources for the corporate sector, the \\nstock exchange performs four essential functions.\\nFirstly, it provides a market place for purchase and sale of securities such as shares, \\nbonds, debentures, etc. Investors desirous of buying securities would be able to buy securities \\nin the primary market only occasionally, that is, at the time of issue of such securities by the \\ncompany, whereas they would be able to buy securities in the stock exchanges at any time, \\nas trading in stock exchanges is continuous. Similarly, holders of securities who are desirous \\nof selling the securities would be able to sell them only in the stock exchanges, as the issuing \\ncompanies do not ordinarily buy back the shares. Thus, stock exchanges provide the facility \\nfor continuous trading in securities.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='43\\nSecondly, stock exchanges provide liquidity to the investments in securities, that \\nis, it gives the investors a place to liquidate their holdings. This is essentially the basis for \\nthe joint stock enterprise system. Investors would not be interested to invest in corporate \\nsecurities without the assurance provided by the stock exchanges to the owners of corporate \\nsecurities that these securities can be sold in the stock exchanges at any time.\\nThirdly, the stock exchanges help in the valuation of securities by providing the \\nmarket quotations of the prices of securities. The market quotations represent the collective \\njudgement on the value of the securities arrived at simultaneously by many sellers and \\nbuyers in the market. The value of shares is influenced by macro economic factors as well \\nas micro economic factors, long-term economic trends as well as short-term fluctuations \\nin economic variables. Speculative forces in the securities market also influence share \\nvaluations. Market quotations of share prices provide valuable information to prospective \\ninvestors as well as shareholders regarding the value of shares traded in the stock exchanges.\\nFourthly, stock exchanges play the role of a barometer, namely, an indicator of the \\nstate of health of the nation’s economy as a whole. The shares of a large number of companies \\nare listed for trading in the important stock exchanges of the country. The market quotations \\nof individual shares represent their current valuation. The trend of price movements in the \\nmarket is indicated by calculating stock market indices which represent the weighted average \\nof prices of selected shares representing all the important industries. These stock market \\nindices are used to represent the share market as a whole. Their movements and levels are \\nindicative of the economic health of the nation to a great extent because movements of \\nprices of shares are influenced by macro economic factors such as growth of GDP , financial \\nand monetary policies, tax changes, political environment, etc.\\nThe stock exchanges provide the linkage between the savings in the household sector \\nand the investments in the corporate sector. They indirectly help in mobilising savings and \\nchannelising them into the corporate sector as securities.\\nStock Market in India\\nThe Indian securities market has become one of the most dynamic and efficient \\nsecurities market in Asia today. The Indian market now conforms to international standards \\nin terms of operating efficiency. In this context, it would be informative to understand the \\norigin and growth of the Indian stock market.\\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, shares of companies used to be floated in \\nIndia occasionally. There were share brokers in Bombay who assisted in the floatation of '),\n",

A small group of stock brokers in Bombay joined together in 1875 to \\nform an association called Native Share and Stockbrokers Association. The association drew \\nup codes of conduct for brokerage business and mobilised private funds for investment in \\nthe corporate sector. It was this association which later became the Bombay Stock Exchange, \\nwhich is the oldest stock exchange in Asia. This exchange is now known as The Stock \\nExchange, Mumbai, or BSE.\\nAhmedabad was a major centre of cotton textile industry. After 1880, many new cotton \\ntextile mills were started in and around Ahmedabad. As new cotton textile enterprises were \\nfloated, the need for a stock exchange at Ahmedabad was strongly felt. Accordingly, in 1894, \\nthe brokers of Ahmedabad formed The Ahmedabad Share and Stockbrokers Association, \\nwhich later became the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange, the second stock exchange of the \\ncountry.\\nDuring the 1900s Kolkata became another major centre of share trading on account \\nof the starting of several indigenous industrial enterprises. As a result, the third stock \\nexchange of the country was started by the Kolkata stockbrokers at Kolkata in 1908. As \\nindustrial activity in the country gained momentum, existing enterprises in cotton textiles, \\nwoollen textiles, tea, sugar, paper, steel, engineering goods, etc. began to undertake \\nexpansion activities and new ventures were also floated. Y et another stock exchange was \\nstarted in 1920 at Chennai. However, by 1923, it ceased to exist. Later, in 1937, the Madras \\nStock Exchange was revived as many new cotton textile mills and plantation companies were \\nfloated in South India. Three more stock exchanges were established before independence, \\nat Indore in Madhya Pradesh in 1930, at Hyderabad in 1943 and at Delhi in 1947. Thus, at \\nthe time of independence, seven stock exchanges were functioning in the major cities of the \\ncountry.\\nThe number of stock exchanges virtually remained unchanged for nearly three \\ndecades from 1947 to 1977, except for the establishment of the Bangalore Stock Exchange \\nin 1957. During the 1980s, however, many stock exchanges were established. \\nSome of them were:\\n1. Cochin Stock Exchange (1978)\\n2. Uttar Pradesh Stock Exchange (at Kanpur, 1982)\\n3. Pune Stock Exchange (1982)\\n4. Ludhiana Stock Exchange (1983)\\n5. Gauhati Stock Exchange (1984)'),\n",

Vadodara Stock Exchange (at Baroda, 1990).\\nThus, from seven stock exchanges in 1947, the number of stock exchanges in the \\ncountry increased to eighteen by 1990. Along with the increase in the number of stock \\nexchanges, the number of listed companies and the capital of the listed companies has also \\ngrown, especially after 1985. Two more stock exchanges were set up at Coimbatore and \\nMeerut during the 1990s, taking the total to twenty.\\nOver the Counter Exchange of India ( OTCEI )\\nThe traditional trading mechanism (floor trading using open outcry system), which \\nprevailed in the Indian stock exchanges, resulted in much functional inefficiency such \\nas absence of liquidity, lack of transparency, undue delay in settlement of transactions, \\nfraudulent practices, etc. With the objective of providing more efficient services to investors, \\nthe country’s first electronic stock exchange which facilitates ringless, scripless trading \\nwas set up in 1992 with the name Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI). It was \\nsponsored by the country’s premier financial institutions such as UTI, ICICI, IDBI, SBI \\nCapital Markets, IFCI, GIC and its subsidiaries and Canbank Financial services.\\nThe exchange was set up to aid enterprising promoters in raising finance for new \\nprojects in a cost effective manner and to provide investors with a transparent and efficient \\nmodel of trading. The OTCEI had many novel features. It introduced screen based trading \\nfor the first time in the Indian stock market. Trading takes place through a network of \\ncomputers of over the counter (OTC) dealers located at several places, linked to a central \\nOTC computer using telecommunication links. All the activities of the OTC trading process \\nare fully computerised. \\nMoreover, OTCEI is a national exchange having a country-wide reach. OTCEI has \\nan exclusive listing of companies, that is, it does not ordinarily list and trade in companies \\nlisted in any other stock exchanges. For being listed in OTCEI the companies have to be \\nsponsored by members of OTCEI. It was the first exchange in the country to introduce \\nthe practice of market making, that is, dealers in securities providing two-way quotes (bid \\nprices and offer prices of securities).'),\n",

The \\nhigh powered committee on stock exchanges known as Pherwani Committee recommended, \\nin 1991, the setting up of a new stock exchange as a model exchange and to function as \\na national stock exchange. It was envisaged that the new exchange should be completely \\nautomated in terms of both trading and settlement procedures. \\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the Pherwani committee, a new stock \\nexchange was promoted by the premier financial institutions of the country, namely 1DB!, \\nICICI, IFCI, all insurance corporations, selected commercial banks and others. The new \\nexchange was incorporated in 1992 as the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It started \\nfunctioning in June 1994.\\nThe purpose of setting up the new exchange was to create a world-class exchange \\nand use it as an instrument of change in the Indian stock market through competitive \\npressure. Technology has been the backbone of NSE. It chose to harness technology in \\ncreating a new market design. Its trading system, called National Exchange for Automated \\nTrading (NEAT), is a state-of-the-art client-server based application. The NSE also uses \\nsatellite communication technology for trading. Its trading system has shifted the trading \\nplatform from the trading hall in the premises of the exchange to the computer terminals \\nat the premises of the trading members located at different geographical locations in the \\ncountry. It has been instrumental in bringing about many changes in the trading system \\nsuch as reduction of settlement cycle, dematerialisation and electronic transfer of securities, \\nestablishment of clearing corporations, professionalisation of trading members, etc.\\nAll the stock exchanges in the country, starting with the Bombay Stock Exchange, \\nhave shifted to the new computerised trading system which facilitates screen-based trading. \\nAs a consequence, the stock market today uses the state-of-the-art information technology \\ntools to provide an efficient and transparent trading, clearing and settlement mechanism \\nat par with international standards. The National Stock Exchange has played a leading role \\nas a change agent in transforming the Indian stock market to its present form. Since its \\ninception, the NSE has been playing the role of a catalytic agent in reforming the stock \\nmarket and evolving the best market practices. The NSE has brought about unparalleled \\ntransparency, speed and efficiency, safety and market integrity. In this process the NSE has \\nbecome the largest stock exchange in the country, relegating the Bombay Stock Exchange \\nto the second place.'),\n",

Automated screen-based trading, rolling settlement \\non T + 2 cycle, dematerialisation of securities with electronic transfer of securities, etc. \\ncompletely transformed the market structures and procedures. Gradually, the two national \\nstock exchanges, BSE and NSE dominated the scene with practically all trading being routed \\nthrough either of these exchanges. The regional stock exchanges became irrelevant as they \\ncould not compete with the breadth and depth of these two stock exchanges, and there was \\nvirtually no trading at any of the nineteen regional centres. \\nThe members of the regional stock exchanges of the country started investing large \\namounts of money in automating their trading, clearing and settlement systems on account \\nof regulatory compulsions. This situation prompted the regional stock exchanges to devise \\nsome way of reviving their fortunes. It was decided to evolve an ipter-connected market \\nsystem by pooling the resources of the regional stock exchanges. Fourteen regional stock \\nexchanges (excluding Calcutta, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Ludhiana and Pune stock exchanges) \\njoined together and promoted a new organisation called Inter-connected Stock Exchange \\nof India Ltd. (ISE) in 1998. The ISE was recognised as a stock exchange by SEBI and it \\ncommenced trading in February, 1999. It then began to function as a national level stock \\nexchange.\\nThe objective of setting up ISE was to optimally utilise the existing infrastructure \\nand other resources of participating stock exchanges which were until now underutilised. \\nThe ISE aims to provide cost-effective trading linkage/ connectivity to all the members of \\nthe participating exchanges on a national level. This will help to widen the market for the \\nsecurities listed on the regional stock exchanges. \\nThrough ISE an attempt is made to make the regional markets vibrant and liquid \\nthrough the use of the state of the art technology and networking. The trading settlement \\nand funds transfer operations of the ISE are completely automated. However, ISE has not \\nsucceeded in becoming a competitive market force to BSE and NSE. This is mainly because \\nthe participating regional stock exchanges did not close down their regional segments.\\nAt present there are twenty-three stock exchanges in the country. Four of them can \\nbe considered as national level exchanges, namely, NSE, BSE, OTCEI and ISE; the remaining \\nnineteen are regional stock exchanges (RSEs) located in important cities of the country. But \\nit may be noted that most of the trading in securities in the country are transacted through \\nthe two largest stock exchanges, namely the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Stock '),\n",

Even in these \\nexchanges, even though there are a large number of companies listed, active daily trading \\ntakes place only in the securities of a limited number of companies. The large volume of \\ntrading is accounted for by limited number of securities. For the vast majority of securities \\nof listed companies, the stock exchanges fail to provide liquidity.\\nOrganisation, Membership and Management of Stock Exchanges\\nBasically, a stock exchange is an organised market for trading securities. It is also \\ncalled a bourse. It is an association or organisation of individuals which is governed by \\ncertain rules and regulations. The manner of organisation and the rules of membership are \\nimportant features of stock exchanges as also the governance system of the organisation.\\nOver the years, stock exchanges in the country have been organised in various forms \\nsuch as voluntary non-profit making association, public limited company and company \\nlimited by guarantee. In India, the earliest stock exchanges were organised as voluntary \\nnon-profit making associations of persons. Later on, stock exchanges began to be organised \\nas companies.\\nThe membership of stock exchanges initially comprised of individuals and \\npartnership firms. It was the stock brokers who became members of stock exchanges either \\nin their individual capacity or by forming partnership firms. Later on companies were also \\nallowed to become members of stock exchanges. Thus, stock exchanges now have both \\nindividual and institutional membership. Membership in stock exchanges is restricted \\nand limited. It is acquired by paying the prescribed entrance fee/share value. Members are \\nalso supposed to make security deposit and pay annual subscription to the exchange. The \\nquantum of entrance fee/share value, security deposit and annual subscription vary from \\nexchange to exchange.\\nThe management of each stock exchange is vested in a Governing Board which is \\nthe apex body deciding the policies of the exchange as also regulating the affairs of the \\nexchange. The composition of the governing board is of a heterogeneous nature. It usually \\nconsists of elected directors (mostly from the broking community), SEBI nominees and \\npublic representatives. The governing board is usually presided over by an executive director \\nor president. The executive director/ president as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the \\nexchange is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the exchange. The governing \\nboard may constitute executive committees of its members to supervise and monitor specific \\nfunctions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='49\\nThe BSE governing board has twenty members consisting of nine elected directors, \\nthree SEBI nominees, six public representatives, an executive director (CEO), and a non- \\nexecutive chairman. The governing board of the National Stock Exchange comprises senior \\nexecutives from promoter institutions, eminent professionals in the fields of law, economics, \\naccountancy, finance, taxation, etc., public representatives, nominees of SEBI and one full- \\ntime executive of the exchange.\\nThe governing board of an exchange has wide powers for the management and \\nadministration of the stock exchange concerned. These powers include wide ranging \\ndiscretionary powers also. \\nThe important powers of the governing body are:\\n1. Manage and control the functioning of the exchange.\\n2. Regulate trading in securities.\\n3. Admit, fine, suspend or expel members and take such disciplinary action as it deems \\nfit.\\n4. Settle disputes, if any, amongst the members and between members and nonmembers.\\n5. Make or amend any rules, by-laws or regulations or suspend their operations with \\nthe approval of the government.\\n6. Interpret the rules, by-laws and regulations. The stock exchanges have to comply \\nwith the directions of the SEBI.\\nListing of Securities\\nFor the securities of a company to be traded on a stock exchange, they have to be \\nlisted in that stock exchange. Listing is the process of including the securities of a company \\nin the official list of the stock exchange for the purpose of trading.\\nAt the time of issue of securities, a company has to apply for listing the securities \\nin a recognised stock exchange. The Securities Contracts Regulation Act and rules, SERI \\nguidelines, and the rules and regulations of the exchange prescribe the statutory requirements \\nto be fulfilled by a company for getting its shares listed in a stock exchange. Important \\ndocuments such as memorandum of association, articles of association, prospectus, directors’ \\nreport, annual accounts, agreement with underwriters, etc. and detailed information about \\nthe company’s activities, its capital structure, distribution of shares, dividends and bonus \\nshares issued, etc. have to be submitted to the stock exchange along with the application for \\nlisting.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='50\\nThe stock exchange examines whether the company satisfies the criteria prescribed \\nfor listing. When the stock exchange finds that a company is eligible for listing its securities \\nat the exchange, the company would be required to execute a listing agreement with the \\nstock exchange. This listing agreement contains the obligations and restrictions imposed \\non the company as a result of listing. The company is also required to pay the annual listing \\nfees every year.\\nThe purpose of the listing agreement is to compel the company to keep the \\nshareholders and investors informed about the various activities which are likely to affect \\nthe share prices of the company. A company whose securities are listed in a stock exchange \\nis obliged to keep the stock exchange fully informed about all matters affecting the company. \\nMoreover, the company has to forward copies of its audited annual accounts to the stock \\nexchange as soon-as they are issued.\\nThe securities of companies listed on a stock exchange may be classified into different \\ngroups. For instance, the securities listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have been \\nclassified into A, B1, B2, F , G and Z groups. The equity shares listed in the exchange have \\nbeen grouped under three groups, namely A, BI and B2, based on certain qualitative and \\nquantitative parameters which include number of trades, value traded, etc. The F group \\nrepresents the fixed income securities. The G group includes Government securities for \\nretail investors. The Z group includes companies which have failed to comply with the \\nlisting requirements of the exchange or have failed to resolve investor complaints or have \\nnot made arrangements with the depositories for dematerialisation of their securities.\\nPermitted Securities\\nThe securities of companies which have signed listing agreement with an exchange \\nare traded at the exchange as listed securities. A stock exchange sometimes permits trading \\nin certain securities which are not listed at the exchange but are actively traded in other \\nstock exchanges. Such securities are known as permitted securities. This facility is provided \\nto help market participants to trade in certain actively traded securities even though they \\nare not formally listed at the exchange. Thus, a stock exchange may have certain listed \\nsecurities and certain permitted securities, and trading may take place in these securities \\nregularly.\\nRegulation of Stock Exchanges\\nThe stock exchanges play a very vital and sensitive role in the functioning of the \\neconomy, especially the private sector of the economy. The functioning of the exchanges, '),\n",

This is ensured through proper \\nregulation of the working of stock exchanges. There are Acts, rules, regulations, by-laws \\nand guidelines governing the functioning of secondary markets or stock exchanges in the \\ncountry. There is also a regulator in the form of the Securities and Exchange Board of \\nIndia (SEBI) to oversee and monitor the functioning of both the primary and secondary \\nsecurities markets in India.\\nThe Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, and the rules made under the \\nAct, namely the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, constitute the main laws \\ngoverning stock exchanges in India. The preamble to the Act states that it is “an act to \\nprevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein” . \\nThis Act provides for the direct and indirect control of virtually all aspects of securities \\ntrading and the functioning of stock exchanges.\\nThe provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, were formerly \\nadministered by the Central Government. However, since the enactment of the Securities \\nand Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the Board established under this Act has been \\nauthorised to administer almost all the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) \\nAct. The various provisions of the Act deal with recognition of stock exchanges, submission \\nof relevant documents, approval of by-laws and rules made by stock exchanges, listing of \\nsecurities in stock exchanges and such other matters relating to the trading of securities and \\nthe functioning of stock exchanges.\\nTaking into consideration the fact that the securities market in India had shown \\ntremendous growth, the government decided to set up a separate board for the regulation \\nand orderly functioning of the securities market in the country, in the model of the Securities \\nand Investment Board (SIB) of UK and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of \\nUSA.\\nInitially, the Securities and Exchange Board of India was constituted as an interim \\nadministrative body in 1988. SEBI was given a statutory status on 30th January 1992 by an \\nordinance to provide for the establishment of SEBI. Later, in April 1992, the Securities and \\nExchange Board of India Act was passed. In this Act it is stipulated that it shall be the duty \\nof the Board to protect the interests of investors in the securities market and to promote the \\ndevelopment of and to regulate the securities market.\\nThus, the SEBI has been constituted to promote orderly and healthy development \\nof the securities market and to ensure adequate protection to the investors in the securities \\nmarket. The Board plays a dual role, namely a regulatory role and a developmental role.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='52\\nThe SEBI is constituted with six members, including the chairman of the Board. \\nTwo members are officials of the central government ministries of Finance and Law, one \\nmember is an official of the Reserve Bank of India and two members are professionals having \\nexperience or special knowledge relating to securities markets and are appointed by the \\ncentral government. The Board is empowered to regulate the business in stock exchanges, \\nto register and regulate the working of stock market intermediaries such as stock brokers, \\nsub-brokers, share transfer agents, bankers to an issue, trustees of trust deeds, registrars to \\nan issue, merchant bankers, underwriters, etc. \\nThe Board is also authorised to prevent and prohibit fraudulent and unfair trade \\npractices in the market. It makes regulations and issues guidelines regarding the various \\naspects of the working of stock exchanges, and constantly monitors the activities in the \\nsecurities market to ensure just and fair dealings. Transparency and equal opportunity to \\nall market participants have been the goals of all developmental and regulatory activities of \\nSEBI.\\nA stock exchange has the power to make by-laws for the regulation and control of \\ncontracts entered into by members and also for the regulation of trading in the exchange. \\nHowever, these by-laws have to be approved by SEBI before implementation. Amendments \\nto the by-laws should also be similarly approved.\\nThe Depositories Act, 1996, is another important legislation affecting the functioning \\nof stock exchanges. This Act provides for the setting up of depositories for electronic \\nrecording and transfer of securities. The paper-based securities and their transfer often \\nresulted in delay in the settlement and transfer of securities and also led to bad delivery, \\ntheft, forgery, etc. The Depositories Act, 1996, was passed to change over to the electronic \\nmode of security transfer through security depositories so as to improve the efficiency of \\nthe system.\\nThe securities market in India is properly regulated to ensure that it functions \\nefficiently and effectively. There are strict laws governing the functioning of stock exchanges; \\nthere is a vigilant regulator who oversees the implementation of these laws. As a result, \\ninvestors now have confidence in the efficiency and robustness of the Indian stock market.\\nTrading System in Stock Exchange\\nA stock exchange is a market for trading in securities. But it is not an ordinary market; \\nit is a market with several peculiar features. In a stock exchange, buyers and sellers do not \\ndirectly meet and interact with each other for making their trades. The investors (buyers '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='53\\nand sellers of securities) trade through brokers who are members of a stock exchange. In \\nstock exchanges, trading procedures are fully automated and member brokers interact and \\ntrade through a networked computer system. Trading in a stock exchange takes place in two \\nphases; in the first phase, the member brokers execute their buy or sell orders on behalf of \\ntheir clients (or investors) and, in the second phase, the securities and cash are exchanged. \\nFor the exchange of securities and cash between the traders, the services of two other \\nagencies are required, namely the clearing house (corporation) of the stock exchange and \\nthe depositories. Further, unlike other ordinary markets, stock exchanges are markets where \\nthe prices of the items traded (namely, securities) fluctuate constantly. This fluctuation in \\nsecurity prices leads to speculative activities in the stock exchanges.\\nWe need to understand clearly the trading system in stockexchanges, how the trades \\nare settled through exchange of securities and cash, the role of the clearing corporation and \\nthe depositories, etc. We also need to understand the different types of speculative activities \\ntaking place in a stock exchange. The information about the prices of securities traded in a \\nstock exchange is useful in understanding the behaviour of the stock markets.\\nTrading System\\nThe system of trading prevailing in stock exchanges for many years was known as \\nfloor trading. In this system, trading took place through an open outcry system on the \\ntrading floor or ring of the exchange during official trading hours.\\nIn floor trading , buyers and sellers transact business face to face using a variety \\nof signals. Under this system, an investor desirous of buying a security gets in touch with \\na broker and places a buy order along with the money to buy the security. Similarly, an \\ninvestor intending to sell a security gets in touch with a broker, places a sell order and hands \\nover the share certificate to be sold. \\nAfter the completion of a transaction at the trading floor between the brokers acting \\non behalf of the investors, the buyer investor would receive the share certificate and the \\nseller investor would receive the cash through their respective brokers.\\nIn the new electronic stock exchanges, which have a fully automated computerised \\nmode of trading, floor trading is replaced with a new system of trading known as screen- \\nbased trading. In this new system, the trading ring is replaced by the computer screen \\nand distant participants can trade with each other through the computer network. The \\nmember brokers can install trading terminals at any place in the country. A large number '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='54\\nof participants, geographically separated from each other, can trade simultaneously at high \\nspeeds from their respective locations. The screen-based trading systems are of two types\\n1. Quote driven system\\n2. Order driven system.\\nUnder the quote driven system, the market-maker, who is the dealer in a particular \\nsecurity, inputs two-way quotes into the system, that is, his bid price (buying price) and \\noffer price (selling price). The market participants then place their orders based on the bid- \\noffer quotes. These are then automatically matched by the system according to certain rules.\\nUnder the order driven system, clients place their buy and sell orders with the brokers. \\nThese are then fed into the system. The buy and sell orders are automatically matched by the \\nsystem according to predetermined rules.\\nTypes of Orders\\nAn investor can have his buy or sell orders executed either at the best price prevailing \\non the exchange or at a price that he determines. Accordingly, an investor may place two \\ntypes of orders, namely, market order or limit order.\\nMarket Orders \\nIn a market order, the broker is instructed by the investor to buy or sell a stated \\nnumber of shares immediately at the best prevailing price in the market. In the case of a buy \\norder, the best price is the lowest price obtainable; in the case of a sell order, it is the highest \\nprice obtainable. When placing a market order, the investor can be fairly certain that the \\norder will be executed, but he will be uncertain of the price until after the order is executed.\\nLimit Orders \\nWhile placing a limit order, the investor specifies in advance the limit price at which \\nhe wants the transaction to be carried out. In the case of a limit order to buy, the investor \\nspecifies the maximum price that he will pay for the share; the order has to be executed \\nonly at the limit price or a lower price. In the case of a limit order to sell shares, the investor \\nspecifies the minimum price he will accept for the share and hence, the order has to be \\nexecuted only at the limit price or a price higher to it. Thus for limit orders to purchase \\nshares the investor specifies a ceiling on the price, and for limit orders to sell shares the \\ninvestor specifies a floor price.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='55\\nLimit orders are generally placed “away from the market” which means that the limit \\nprice is somewhat removed from the prevailing market price. In the case of a limit order \\nto buy, the limit price would be below the prevailing price and in the case of a limit order \\nto sell, the limit price would be above the prevailing market price. The investor placing \\nlimit orders believes that his limit price will be reached and the order executed within a \\nreasonable period of time. But the limit order may remain unexecuted.\\nThere are certain special types of orders which may be used by investors to protect \\ntheir profits or limit their losses. Two such special kinds of orders are stop orders (also \\nknown as stop loss orders) and stop limit orders.\\nStop Orders \\nA stop order may be used by an investor to protect a profit or limit a loss. For a stop \\norder, the investor must specify what is known as a stop price. If it is a sell order, the stop \\nprice must be below the market price prevailing at the time the order is placed. If it is a buy \\norder, the stop price must be above the market price prevailing at the time of placing the \\norder. If, subsequently, the market price reaches or passes the stop price, the stop order will \\nbe executed at the best available price. Thus, a stop order can be viewed as a conditional \\nmarket order, because it becomes a market order when the market price reaches or passes \\nthe stop price.\\nExamples will help to clarify the working of stop orders. Suppose an investor has \\n100 shares of a company which were purchased at ` 35 per share. The current market price \\nof the share is ` 75. The investor thus has earned a profit of ` 40 per share on his share \\nholdings. He would very much like to protect this profit without foregoing the opportunity \\nof earning more profit if the price moves still upwards. This can be achieved by placing a \\nstop sell order at a price below the, current market price of ` 75, for example at ` 70. Now, \\nif the price subsequently falls to ` 70 or below, the stop sell order becomes a market order \\nand it will be executed at the best price prevailing in the market. Thus, the investor will be \\nable to protect the profit of around ` 35 per share. On the contrary, if the market price of \\nthe share moves upwards, the stop sell order will not be executed and the investor retains \\nthe opportunity of earning higher profits on his holding.\\nStop orders can also be used to minimise loss in trading. Suppose that a share is \\ncurrently selling for ` 125 and an investor expects a fall in the price of the share. He may \\nplace an order for sale of the share at the current market price of ` 125 hoping to cover up \\nhis position by purchasing the share at a lower price and thus make a profit on the deal. This \\ntype of a transaction is known as a short sale. If price of the share falls as anticipated by the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='56\\ninvestor, he would make a profit. There is a possibility that the price may move upwards \\nand in that case the investor has to purchase the share at a higher price to cover up his \\nposition and meet his sales commitment. This will result in a loss to the investor. This loss \\ncan be minimised by placing a stop buy order at a price above the current price of ` 125, for \\nexample at ` 130. \\nNow, if the price of the share rises to ` 130 or above, the stop buy order will become \\na market order and will be executed at the best price available in the market. Suppose that \\nthe stop buy order was executed at ` 131, then the loss of the investor is limited to ` 6 per \\nshare, that is, the difference between the selling price of ` 125 and the buying price of ` 131 \\nper share.\\nOne disadvantage of the stop orders is that the actual price at which the order is \\nexecuted is uncertain and may be some distance away from the stop price.\\nStop Limit Orders \\nThe stop limit order is a special type of order designed to overcome the uncertainty \\nof the execution price associated with a stop order. The stop limit order gives the investor \\nthe opportunity of specifying a limit price for executing the stop orders: the maximum price \\nfor a stop buy order and the minimum price for a stop sell order. With a stop limit order, the \\ninvestor specifies two prices, a stop price and a limit price. When the market price reaches \\nor passes the stop price, the stop limit order becomes a limit order to be executed within the \\nlimit price. Hence, a stop limit order can be viewed as a conditional limit order.\\nLet us consider two examples. Consider a share that is currently selling at ` 60. An \\ninvestor who holds the share may place a stop limit order to sell with stop price of ` 55 and \\nlimit price of ` 52. If the market price declines to ` 55 or lower, a limit order to sell the share \\nat the limit price of ` 52 or higher would be activated. Here the order will be executed only \\nif the share is available at ` 52 or above. Thus a stop limit order may remain unexecuted.\\nConsider an investor who desires to make a short sale of a particular share at its \\ncurrent market price of ` 85. That is, he intends to sell the share without owning it but \\nhoping to buy it later from the market at a lower price. He may also place a stop limit order \\nto buy the share to minimise his loss in case the share price moves upwards contrary to his \\nexpectations. He may specify a stop price of ` 90 and a limit price of ` 93 for his stop limit \\norder to buy. If the price moves up to ` 90 or above, then a limit order to buy the share with \\nlimit price of ` 93 would be activated.

The stop \\norder results in certain execution at an uncertain price, while a stop limit order results in \\nuncertain execution within a specified price limit.\\nTrading in stock exchanges takes place continuously during the official trading hours. \\nStock exchanges are open five days a week, from Monday through Friday. An investor may \\nplace orders for trade through his broker at any time during the official trading hours, but \\nhe needs to specify the time limit for the validity of the order. The time limit on an order is \\nessentially an instruction to the broker about the time within which he should attempt to \\nexecute the order.\\nDay Orders A day order is an order that is valid only for the trading day on which the \\norder is placed. If the order is not executed by the end of the day, it is treated as cancelled. \\nAll orders are ordinarily treated as day orders unless specified as other types of orders.\\nWeek Orders These are orders that are valid till the end of the week during which \\nthe orders are placed. They expire at the close of the trading session on Friday of the week, \\nunless they are executed by then.\\nMonth Orders These are orders that are valid till the end of the month during which \\nthe orders are placed. Month orders expire at the close of the trading session on the last \\nworking day of the month.\\nOpen Orders Open orders are orders that remain valid till they are executed by the \\nbrokers or specifically cancelled by the investor. They are also known as good till cancelled \\norders or GTC orders. However, brokers generally seek periodic confirmation of open \\norders from the investors.\\nFill or Kill Orders These orders are also known as FoK orders. These orders are \\nmeant to be executed immediately. If not executed immediately, they are to be treated as \\ncancelled.\\nSettlement\\nTrading in stock exchanges is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the \\nexecution of the orders submitted by clients takes place between brokers acting on behalf of \\nthe clients or investors. Buy orders are matched with sell orders. In the automated system, \\ntrading is carried out in an anonymous environment and the orders are matched by the \\ncomputer system.'),\n",

This process of transfer of security and cash is done in the second phase which is \\nknown as the settlement of the trade. The settlement process involving delivery of securities \\nand payment of cash is carried out through a separate agency known as the clearing house \\nwhich functions in each stock exchange. The clearing house acts as the counter party for \\neach trade. Member-brokers who sell securities have to deliver the securities to the clearing \\nhouse and will receive cash from the clearing house. Similarly, the member- brokers \\nwho buy securities will have to pay cash to the clearing house and receive the securities \\nfrom the clearing house. The stock exchanges now follow a settlement procedure known \\nas Compulsory Rolling Settlement (CRS) as mandated by SEBI. The earlier procedure of \\nsettlement was “account period settlement” wherein all trades carried out or executed \\nduring an account period of a week or fortnight were settled on the last day of the account \\nperiod. The account period used to vary from exchange to exchange.\\nUnder the rolling settlement system, the trades executed on a particular day are \\nsettled after a specified number of business days or working days. Initially, a T + 5 settle -\\nment cycle was introduced, which was subsequently reduced to a T + 3 cycle. Currently, a \\nT + 2 settlement cycle is adopted by the stock exchanges. This means that the settlement \\nof transactions done on T, that is, the trade day, has to be done on the second business day \\nafter the trade day. The pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities has to take place on the \\nsecond business day after the day of trade. For example, for an order executed on Tuesday of \\na week, the settlement (delivery of security and payment of cash) has to be done on Thurs -\\nday. The pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities are marked through the clearing house.\\nOn the first business day (T + 1) after the trade day (T), the exchange generates \\ndelivery and receive orders for transactions done by member-brokers. These provide the \\nrelevant information regarding the securities to be delivered /received by the member- \\nbrokers through the clearing house. Similarly, a money statement showing the details of \\npayments/ receipts of monies by the member-brokers is also prepared by the exchange. The \\nDelivery/ Receive orders and the Money Statement can be downloaded by the member- \\nbrokers.\\nOn the second business day (T + 2) after the day of trade, the member-brokers are \\nrequired to submit the pay-in instructions to the depositories for transfer of securities to \\nthe clearing house in the case of demat securities. In the case of securities in physical form, \\nthe certificates have to be delivered to the clearing house. For pay-in of funds by member- \\nbrokers, the bank accounts of member-brokers maintained with the authorised clearing \\nbanks are directly debited through the computerised system.'),\n",

A person may be interested in getting a good rate of return, earned \\non a rather consistent basis, for a relatively long period of time. For this he will choose the \\nshares of a company which is fundamentally strong and has the potential for growth in the \\nfuture. \\nSuch a person is a genuine investor who invests his money in securities for long-term \\nreturns. There may be other persons who have a short-term perspective on their trading \\nactivities on the stock exchanges. A person may be interested in making a quick short-term \\nprofit from the fluctuations in the prices of securities in the stock market. Such a person is \\nknown as a speculator. Speculators are traders who intend to make high returns within a \\nshort span of time, making use of the short-term fluctuations in security prices.\\nSpeculators constantly monitor the movement of share prices in the market. On the \\nbasis of their analysis of share price movements and on the basis of the evaluation of various \\ninformation regarding the performance of companies, the speculative traders speculate on \\nthe future course of prices. They believe that mispricing of securities occurs periodically \\nin the market. Sometimes, some securities may be overpriced (that is, their price may be \\nhigher than their intrinsic value) and at other times some securities may be underpriced. \\nSpeculators attempt to exploit such mispricing of securities, because it is presumed that the \\nmispricing would be corrected by the market eventually.'),\n",

The \\nspeculator in this case is said to take a long position with respect to that security. He is not \\ninterested in taking delivery of the security, but intends to sell it off as quickly as possible to \\ngain some profit. Hence, he would not like to hold his long position for an extended period. \\nHe would like the mispricing to be corrected at the earliest, preferably, on the same day. \\nSuch kind of a speculative activity is known as long buy.\\nShort Sale\\nOn the contrary, if a speculator estimates that a security is overpriced and its price \\nis likely to decline shortly, he would like to sell the security at the current price and buy \\nit sometime later when the price declines so as to deliver the security sold at the time \\nof settlement of the trade. Ordinarily, a person sells securities which he owns. Here, the \\nspeculator is selling a security which he does not own or possess in the hope that he would \\nbe able to deliver the security on the due date ‘by buying it at a lower price within a short \\nperiod of time. He hopes to gain some profit in the transaction. The speculator in this case \\nis taking a “short position” with respect to the security by engaging in a ‘short sale’ . \\nFundamentally, a short sale is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller \\nat the time of the transaction. A short seller has to cover up his position or eliminate the \\ndeficiency by buying the security sometime in the near future. He will be able to make a \\nprofit out of the short sale transaction only if he is able to buy the security at a lower price. \\nIf the price of a security moves up against his anticipations, he will suffer a loss.\\nSpeculation involves high amount of risk. The speculators take long or short \\npositions on the basis of their estimation or speculation about the future movement of \\nprices. If the prices of securities do not move in the expected directions within a short time, \\nthe speculators suffer losses.\\nTypes of Speculators\\nTraders engaged in speculative activity in the stock market are described by different \\nnames based on the type of activity they generally engage in. The prominent among them \\nare hulls, bears, stag and lame duck.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='61\\nBull\\nA trader who expects a rise in prices of securities is known as a bull. He, therefore, \\ntakes a long position with respect to securities. He engages in long buy anticipating a rise in \\nprices of securities. The bulls will be able to make profit only if the prices rise as anticipated; \\notherwise they will suffer losses. When there is an overbought condition in the market, that \\nis, the purchases made by speculators exceed the sales made by them; the bulls begin to \\nspread good rumours about companies so as to raise the price of their shares. This activity \\nis called a bull campaign.\\nWhen the prices of securities are generally rising in the market, resulting in buoyancy \\nand optimism in the stock market, the market is said to be in a bullish phase.\\nBear\\nA bear is a pessimist who expects a decline in the prices of securities. He, therefore, \\ntakes a ‘short position’ on securities by engaging in short sales. He attempts to cover up his \\nshort position by buying the securities at lower prices when prices decline. He may engage \\nin a bear raid so as to bring down the prices of securities. Spreading unfavourable rumours \\nabout companies with the intention of creating a decline in their share prices is known as \\na bear raid. The bear will suffer a loss if the prices of securities rise after he takes a short \\nposition on securities. When there is a general decline in prices of securities in the stock \\nmarket, the market is said to be bearish.\\nLame Duck \\nA lame duck is a bear who has made a short sale but is unable to meet his commitment \\nto deliver the securities sold by him on account of rise in prices of securities subsequent to \\nthe short sale. He is said to be struggling like a lame duck.\\nStag\\nA stag is a trader who applies for shares in the new issues market just like a genuine \\ninvestor. A stag is an optimist like the bull and expects a rise in the prices of securities that \\nhe has applied for. He anticipates that when the new shares are listed in the stock exchange \\nfor trading, they would be quoted at a premium, that is, above their issue price. As soon \\nas the stag receives the allotment of shares, he would sell them at the stock exchange at \\nthe higher price and make a profit. A stag is said to be a premium hunter. The stag will, \\nhowever, suffer a loss if prices of the new shares do not rise as anticipated when they are \\nlisted for trading.'),\n",

Other investors may use borrowed funds for buying \\nsecurities when there is a good opportunity to buy some securities but ready cash may not \\nbe available. \\nBorrowing money from the bank or the broker for purchasing securities is known as \\nmargin trading. The investor pays a part of the value of the securities to be purchased; the \\nbalance is provided by the broker or the banker. The cash paid by the investor is the margin. \\nFor example, if an investor places buy orders for purchase of securities worth ` 50,000 and \\npays as cash ` 30,000 to the broker, the investor’s margin is 60 per cent of the value of the \\nsecurities. The balance amount is supplied by the broker.\\nIn margin trading, the investor has to pay interest on the money borrowed to finance \\nthe securities transaction. Thus profit or gain from the transaction would be reduced to that \\nextent. Even if there is no gain from the securities transaction, interest on the borrowed \\nfunds has to be paid. Margin trading is thus a risky venture.\\nDepositories\\nFinancial securities such as equity shares, bonds and debentures are issued by \\ncompanies to the investors who purchase them. They used to be issued in the form of \\ncertificates specifying the name of the holder, the number of securities comprised in each \\ncertificate, the face value of the security, etc. When the securities are subsequently traded \\nbetween investors, the seller of the security hands over the certificate to the buyer through \\nthe stock exchange clearing house. The buyer then forwards the certificate to the issuing \\ncompany or its authorised transfer agents to get his name entered in the certificate as the \\nholder of the security. In this practice, the security has a physical form, namely that of a \\npaper certificate.\\nThe physical form of securities is giving way to electronic form of securities wherein \\na security is represented by an entry in a depository account opened by the investor for the \\npurpose. The transfer of securities on sale of a security is effected through a debit entry \\nin the depository account of the seller and a credit entry in the depository account of the \\nbuyer. The securities are issued, held and transferred in dematerialised form or ‘demat \\nmode’ . For the demat mode of shareholding, depositories play the most important role. Let \\nus understand what depositories are and how they function.'),\n",

A bank holds cash for customers and \\nprovides services related to transactions of cash. For this a customer opens an account in \\nany of the branches of the bank. A depository holds securities for investors in electronic \\nform and provides services related to transactions of securities. A depository interacts \\nwith clients through depository participants (DPs) which are organisations affiliated to \\na depository. An investor has to open a demat account with a depository participant to \\navail depository services of holding securities and transferring securities. There are two \\ndepositories in India namely:\\n1. National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)\\n2. Central Depositories Services (of India) Limited (CDSL)\\nNSDL was India’s first depository which started functioning on November 6, 1996. \\nCDSL was inaugurated on July 15, 1999. The functioning of these depositories is supervised \\nand regulated by SEBI. Each depository has several depository participants affiliated to it.\\nSEBI has now made it compulsory for trades in almost all listed securities to be \\nsettled in demat mode. For this purpose, registered members of stock exchanges open \\nclearing member accounts or pool accounts with depositories. These pool accounts are \\nused by member-brokers to hold securities from clients and deliver them to the clearing \\ncorporation. These accounts are also similarly used to receive securities from the clearing \\ncorporation for onward distribution to clients.\\nThe demat accounts opened by investors with depository participants are known \\nas beneficiary accounts. When an investor has sold a security through a member-broker, \\nhe has to deliver the security to the member-broker who, in turn, has to deliver it to the \\nclearing corporation. The investor has to authorise his DP to transfer the security from his \\nbeneficiary account to the clearing member’s pool account. Accordingly, the beneficiary \\naccount of the investor would be debited and the pool account of the clearing member would \\nbe credited. The clearing member gives authorisation to his DP to deliver the securities to \\nthe clearing corporation.\\nWhen an investor has purchased securities through member-brokers he has to receive \\nthe securities from the member-brokers. In the first instance, the clearing corporation will \\ninstruct its depository to credit the securities to the pool accounts of member-brokers who \\nare entitled to receive them on pay-out day. The member-broker then instructs his DP to \\ndebit his pool account and credit the beneficiary account of the client with the securities to \\nbe transferred to the client.'),\n",

This is done by the DP on a request from the investor. \\nSecurities in demat form (or electronic form) may again be converted back to the physical \\nform (certificates), if desired. This process is known as rematerialisation. At the time of \\nissue of new securities by a company, the securities allotted to an investor can be directly \\ncredited to his demat account.\\nAccording to the Depositories Act, 1996, an investor has the option to hold securities \\neither in physical form or in dematerialised form. But holding securities in demat form has \\nseveral advantages. It is safe and also convenient to hold securities in demat form. Transfer \\nof securities in physical form involves despatching of certificates through the postal service. \\nThis may result in delay, loss of certificate in transit, theft of certificate, damage to the \\ncertificate, etc. In demat form, transfer of securities is instantaneous and effortless. Much \\npaper work is done away with in demat mode.\\nStock Market Quotations and Indices\\nIn stock exchanges, continuous trading in securities takes place and these trades \\noccur at different prices. As a result, even on a single day, prices of securities may fluctuate. \\nOn any trading day, four prices can be easily identified, namely, opening price, closing price, \\nthe highest price of the day and the lowest price of the day. Apart from these short-term \\nintra-day fluctuations, prices of securities exhibit certain secular trends when considered \\nover a fairly long period of time. Prices may gradually increase over a long-term period; or \\nthey may decline over the long-term period. Ordinarily, prices move in a cyclical fashion, \\nalternatively showing increasing and declining tendencies.\\nThe short-term as well as long-term fluctuations in prices of securities are indicators \\nof the variations in the underlying economic variables. Hence, it is necessary to closely \\nobserve and monitor the movement of prices in the securities market. Price information \\nbecomes quite valuable for this purpose. Price quotations of traded securities are available \\nfrom the stock exchanges and are being published daily by most of the newspapers. Financial \\ndailies give very detailed price quotations (opening and closing prices, highest and lowest \\nprices, 52-week high and low prices, etc.), including the data on volume of daily trading.\\nIn addition to the price quotations of individual ‘securities, stock exchanges make \\navailable stock market indices, which are useful in understanding the level of prices and '),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='73\\nEconomy Analysis\\n The performance of a company depends on the performance of the economy. If the \\neconomy is booming, incomes rise, demand for goods increases, and hence the industries \\nand companies in general tend to the prosperous. On the other hand, if the economy is in \\nrecession, the performance of companies will be generally bad.\\nInvestors are concerned with those variables in the economy which affect the \\nperformance of the company in which they intend to invest. A study of these economic \\nvariables would give an idea about future corporate earnings and the payment of dividends \\nand interest part of his fundamental analysis.\\nGrowth Rates of National Income\\n The rate of growth of the national economy is an important variable to be considered \\nby an investor. GNP (gross national product), NNP (net national product) and GDP (gross \\ndomestic product) are the different measures of the total income or total economic output \\nof the country as a whole. The growth rates of these measures indicate the growth rate of \\nthe economy. The estimates of GNP , NNP and GDP and their rates are made available by \\nthe government from time to time.\\nThe estimated growth rate of the economy would be a pointer towards the prosperity \\nof the economy. An economy typically passes through different phases of prosperity known \\nas the different stages of the economic or business cycle. The four stages of an economic \\ncycle are depression, recovery, boom and recession. The stage of the economic cycle through \\nwhich a country passes has a direct impact on the performance of industries and companies.\\nDepression is the worst of the four stages. During a depression, demand is low and \\ndeclining. Inflation is often high and so are interest rates. Companies are forced to reduce \\nproduction, shut down plant and lay off workers. During the recovery stage, the economy \\nbegins to revive after a depression. Demand picks up leading to more investments in the \\neconomy. Production, employment and profits are on the increase.\\nThe boom phase of the economic cycle is characterized by high demand. Investments \\nand production are maintained at a high level to satisfy the high demand. Companies \\ngenerally post higher profits. The boom phase gradually slows down. The economy slowly \\nbegins to experience a downturn in demand, production, employment, etc. The profits of \\ncompanies also start to decline. This is the recession stage of the business cycle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='74\\nWhile analyzing the growth rate of the economy, an investor would do well to \\ndetermine the stage of the economic cycle through which the economy is passing and \\nevaluate its impact on his investment decision.\\nInflation\\n Inflation prevailing in the economy has considerable impact on the performance of \\ncompanies. Higher rates of inflation upset business plans, lead to cost escalation and result \\nin a squeeze on profit margins. \\n On the other hand, inflation leads to erosion of purchasing power in the hands of \\nconsumers. This will result in lower demand for products. Thus, high rates of inflation in \\nan economy are likely to affect the performance of companies adversely. Industries and \\ncompanies prosper during times of low inflation.\\n Inflation is measured both in terms of wholesale prices through the wholesale price \\nindex (WPI) and in terms of retail prices through the consumer price index (CPI). These \\nfigures are available on weekly or monthly basis. As part of the fundamental analysis, an \\ninvestor should evaluate the inflation rate prevailing in the economy currently as also the \\ntrend of inflation likely to prevail in the future.\\nInterest Rates\\n Interest rates determine the cost and availability of credit for companies operating in \\nan economy. A low interest rate stimulates investment by making credit available easily and \\ncheaply. Moreover, it implies lower cost of finance for companies and thereby assures higher \\nprofitability. On the contrary, higher interest rates result in higher cost of production which \\nmay lead to lower profitability and lower demand.\\nThe interest rates in the organized financial sector of the economy are determined \\nby the monetary policy of the government and the trends in money supply. These rates are \\nthus controlled and vary within certain ranges. \\nBut the interest rates in the unorganized financial sector are not controlled and may \\nfluctuate widely depending upon the demand and supply of funds in the market. Further, \\nlong-term interest rates differ from short-term interest rates.\\nAn investor has to consider the interest rates prevailing in the different segments of \\nthe economy and evaluate their impact on the performance and profitability of companies.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='75\\nGovernment Revenue, Expenditure and Deficits\\n As the government is the largest investor and spender of money, the trends in \\ngovernment revenue, expenditure and deficits have a significant impact on the performance \\nof industries and companies. Expenditure by the government stimulates the economy by \\ncreating jobs and generating demand. Since a major portion of demand in the economy \\nis generated by government spending, the nature of government spending is of great \\nimportance in determining the fortunes of many an industry.\\nHowever, when government expenditure exceeds its revenue, there occurs a deficit. \\nThis deficit is known as budget deficit. All developing countries suffer from budget deficits \\nas government spend large amount of money to build up infrastructure. But budget deficit is \\nan important determinant of inflation, as it leads to deficit financing which fuels inflation.\\nExchange Rates\\n The performance and profitability of industries and companies that are major \\nimporters or exporters are considerably affected by the exchange rates of the rupee against \\nmajor currencies of the world. A depreciation of the rupee improves the competitive position \\nof Indian products in foreign markets, thereby stimulating exports. But it would also make \\nimports more expensive. A company depending heavily on imports may find devaluation of \\nthe rupee affecting its profitability adversely.\\n The exchange rates of the rupee are influenced by the balance of trade deficit, the \\nbalance of payments deficit and also the foreign exchange reserves of the country. The \\nexcess of imports over exports is called balance of trade deficit. The balance of payments \\ndeficit represents the net difference payable on account of all transactions such as trade, \\nservices and capital transaction. If these deficits increase, there is a possibility that the \\nrupee may depreciate in value.\\n A country needs foreign exchange reserves to meet several commitments such as \\npayment for imports and servicing of foreign debts. Balance of payment deficit typically \\nleads to decline in foreign exchange reserves as the deficit has to be met from the reserve. \\nThe size of the foreign exchange reserve is a measure of the strength of the rupee on external \\naccount. Large foreign exchange reserves help to increase the value of the rupee against \\nother currencies.\\n The exchange rates of the rupee against the major currencies of the world are \\npublished daily in the financial press. An investor has to keep track of the trend in exchange '),\n",

An analysis of the balance of trade deficit, balance of payments deficit and \\nthe foreign exchange reserves will help to project the future trends in exchange rates.\\nInfrastructure\\n The development of an economy depends very much on the infrastructure available. \\nIndustry needs electricity for its manufacturing activities, roads and railways to transport \\nraw materials and finished goods, communication channels to keep in touch with suppliers \\nand customers.\\n The availability of infrastructural facilities such as power, transportation and \\ncommunication systems affects the performance of companies. Bad infrastructure leads to \\ninefficiencies, lower productivity, wastage and delays. An investor should assess the status \\nof the infrastructural facilities available in the economy before finalizing has investment \\nplans.\\nMonsoon\\n The Indian economy is essentially an agrarian economy and agriculture forms a  \\nvery important sector of the Indian economy. Because of the strong forward and back -\\nward linkages between agriculture and industry, performance of several industries and  \\ncompanies are dependent on the performance of agriculture. Moreover, as agricultural  \\nincomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will be good and industry \\nwill prosper.\\n But the performance of agriculture to a very great extent depends on the monsoon. \\nThe adequacy of the monsoon determines the success or failure of the agricultural activities \\nin India. Hence, the progress and adequacy of the monsoon becomes a matter of great \\nconcern for an investor in the Indian context.\\nEconomic and Political Stability\\n A stable political environment is necessary for steady and balanced growth. No \\nindustry or company can grow and prosper in the midst of political turmoil. Stable long-\\nterm economic policies are what are needed for industrial growth. Such stable policies \\ncan emanate only from stable political systems as economic and political factors are inter-\\nlinked. A stable government with clear cut long – term economic policies will be conducive \\nto good performance of the economy. '),\n",

But as investment is a future-oriented activity, \\nthe investor is more interested in the expected future performance of the overall economy \\nand its various segments. For this, forecasting the future direction of the economy becomes \\nnecessary. Economic forecasting thus becomes a key activity in economy analysis.\\nThe central theme in economic forecasting is to forecast the national income with its \\nvarious components. Gross national product or GNP is a measure of the national income. It \\nis the total value of the final output of goods and services produced in the economy. It is a \\nmeasure of the total economic activities over a specified period of time and is an indicator \\nof the level and rate of growth of economic activities. An investor would be particularly \\ninterested in forecasting the various components of the national income, especially those \\ncomponents that have a bearing on the particular industries and companies that he is \\nanalysing.\\nForecasting Techniques\\n Economic forecasting may be carried out for short-term periods (up to three years), \\nintermediate term periods (three to five years) and long-term periods (more than five years). \\nAn investor is more concerned about short-term economic forecasts for periods ranging \\nfrom a quarter to three years. Some of the techniques of short-term economic forecasting \\nare discussed below:\\nAnticipatory Surveys\\nMuch of the activities in government, business, trade and industry are planned in \\nadvance and stated in the form of budgets. Consumers also plan for their major spending \\nin advance. To the extent that institutions and people plan and budget for expenditures in \\nadvance, surveys of their intentions can provide valuable input to short-term economic \\nforecasting.\\nAnticipatory surveys are the surveys of intentions of people in government, \\nbusiness, trade and industry regarding their construction activities, plant and machinery \\nexpenditures, level of inventory, etc. Such surveys may also include the future plans of \\nconsumers with regard to their spending on durables and non-durables. Based on the results \\nof these surveys, the analyst can form his own forecast of the future state of the economy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='78\\nThe greatest shortcoming of the anticipatory surveys is that there is no guarantee \\nthat the intentions surveyed will certainly materialise. The forecast based on anticipatory \\nsurveys or surveys of intentions will be valid only to the extent that the intentions are \\ntranslated into action. Hence, the analyst cannot rely solely on these surveys.\\nBarometric or Indicator Approach\\n In this approach to economic forecasting, various types of indicators are studied to \\nfind out how the economy is likely to perform in the future. These indicators are time series \\ndata of certain economic variables. The indicators are classified into leading, coincidental \\nand lagging indicators.\\n The leading indicators are those time series data that reach their high points (peaks) \\nor their low points (troughs) in advance of the high points and low points of total economic \\nactivity. The coincidental indicators reach their peaks and troughs at approximately the \\nsame time as the economy, while the lagging indicators reach their turning points after the \\neconomy has already reached its own turning points. In this method, the indicators1 act as \\nbarometers to indicate the future level of economic activity. However, careful examination \\nof historical data of economic series is necessary to ascertain which economic variables \\nhave led, lagged behind or moved together with the economy.\\n The US Department of Commerce, through its Bureau of Economic Analysis, has \\nprepared a short list of the different indicators. Some of them are given below for illustrative \\npurpose.\\nLeading Indicators\\n Average weekly hours of manufacturing production workers\\n Average weekly initial unemployment claims\\nContracts and orders for plant and machinery\\nNumber of new building permits issued\\nIndex of S and P 500 stock prices\\nMoney supply (M2)\\n Change in sensitive materials prices\\nChange in manufactures’ unfilled orders (durable goods industries)\\nIndex of consumer expectations'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='79\\nCoincidental Indicators\\n Employees on non-agricultural pay rolls\\n Personal income less transfer payments\\n Index of industrial production\\n Manufacturing and trade sales\\nLagging Indicators\\n Average duration of unemployment\\n Ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to sales\\n Average prime rate\\n Commercial and industrial loans outstanding\\n Change in consumer price index for services\\nOf the three types of indicators, leading indicators are more useful for economic \\nforecasting because they measure something that foreshadows a change in economic activity. \\n The indicator approach has its own limitations. It is useful in forecasting the direction \\nof the change in aggregate economic activity, but it does not indicate the magnitude or \\nduration of the change. Further, the leading indicators may give false signals. Moreover, \\ndifferent leading indicators may give conflicting signals. The indicator approach becomes \\nuseful for economic forecasting only if data collection and presentation are done quickly. \\nAny delay in presentation of data defeats the purpose of the indicators. \\nEconometric Model Building\\n This is the most precise and scientific of the different forecasting techniques. This \\ntechnique makes use of Econometrics, which is a discipline that applies mathematical and \\nstatistical techniques to economic theory.\\nIn the economic field we find complex interrelationships between the different \\neconomic variables. The precise relationships between the dependent and independent \\nvariables are specified in a formal mathematical manner in the form of equations. The \\nsystem of equations is then solved to yield a forecast that is quite precise.\\nIn applying this technique, the analyst is forced to define learly and precisely the \\ninterrelationships between the economic variables. The accuracy of the forecast derived '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='80\\nfrom this technique would depend on the validity of the assumptions made by the analyst \\nregarding economic interrelationships and the quality of his input data.\\nEconometric models used for economic forecasting are generally complex. Vast \\namounts of data are required to be collected and processed for the solution of the model. \\nThis may cause delay in making the results available. Undue delay may render the results \\nobsolete for purpose of forecasting.\\nOpportunistic Model Building\\n This is one of the most widely used forecasting techniques. It is also known as GNP \\nmodel building or sectoral analysis.\\nInitially, an analyst estimates the total demand in the economy, and based on this he \\nestimates the total income or GNP for the forecast period. This initial estimate takes into \\nconsideration the prevailing economic environment such as the existing tax rates, interest \\nrates, rate of inflation and other economic and fiscal policies of the government. \\nAfter this initial forecast is arrived at, the analyst now begins building up a forecast of \\nthe GNP figure by estimating the levels of various components of GNP . For this, he collects \\nthe figures of consumption expenditure, gross private domestic investment, government \\npurchase of goods and services and net exports. He adds these figures together to arrive at \\nthe GNP forecast.\\nThe two GNP forecasts arrived at by two different methods will be compared and \\nnecessary adjustments will be made to bring the two forecasts into line with each other.\\nThe opportunistic model building approach makes use of other forecasting \\ntechniques to build up the various components. A vast amount of judgement and ingenuity \\nis also applied to make the overall forecast reliable.\\nEconomic forecasting is an extremely complex and difficult process. No method is \\nexpected to give accurate results. The investor must evaluate all economic forecasts critically \\nbefore making his investment decision.\\nEconomy analysis is an important part of fundamental analysis. It gives the investor \\nan overall picture of the expected performance of the economy in the near future. This is a \\nvaluable input to investment decision-making.\\n****'),\n",

For the convenience of the investors, the broad \\nclassification of the industry is given in financial dailies and magazines. Companies are \\ndistinctly classified to give a clear picture about their manufacturing process and products. \\nThe table gives the industry wise classification given in Reserve Bank of India Bulletin.\\nIndustry Groups\\nIndustries\\n1 Food Products\\n2 Beverages, Tobacco and Tobacco products\\n3 Textiles\\n4 Wood and wood products\\n5 Leather and leather products\\n6 Rubber and plastic products\\n7 Chemical and chemical products\\n8 Non-metallic mineral products\\n9 Basic metals, alloys and metal products\\n10 Machinery and Machine tools\\n11 Transport equipment and parts\\n12 Other Miscellaneous manufacturing industries\\n The table shows that each industry is different from the other. Textile industry is \\nentirely different from the steel industry or the power industry in its product and process.\\n These industries can be classified on the basis of the business cycle i.e., classified \\naccording reactions to the different phases of the business cycle. They are classified into \\ngrowth, cyclical, defensive and cyclical growth industry. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='82\\nGrowth Industry\\n The growth industries have special features of high rate of earnings and growth \\nin expansion, independent of the business cycle. The expansion of the industry mainly \\ndepends on the technological change. For instance, inspite of the recession in the Indian \\neconomy in 1997-98, there was a spurt in the growth of information technology. It defied \\nthe business cycle and continued to grow. Like wise in every phase of the history certain \\nindustries like colour televisions, pharmaceutical and telecommunication industries have \\nshown remarkable growth.\\nCyclical Industry\\n The growth and the profitability of the industry move along with the business cycle. \\nDuring the boom period they enjoy growth and during depression they suffer a set back. \\nFor example, the white goods like fridge, washing machine and kitchen range products \\ncommand a good market in the boom period and the demand for them slackens during the \\nrecession\\nDefensive Industry\\n Defensive industry defies the movement of the business cycle. For example, food and \\nshelter are the basic requirements of humanity. The food industry withstands recession and \\ndepression. The stocks of the defensive industries can be held by the investor for income \\nearning purpose. They expand and earn income in the depression period too, under the \\ngovernment’s umbrella of protection and are counter cyclical in nature.\\nCyclical Growth Industry\\n This is new type of industry that is cyclical and at the same time growing. For \\nexample, the automobile industry experiences periods of stagnation, decline but they \\ngrow tremendously. The change in technology and introduction of new models help the \\nautomobile industry to resume their growth path.\\nIndustry Life Cycle\\n The industry life cycle theory is generally attributed to Julius Grodensky. The life \\ncycle of the industry is separated into four well defined stages such as\\n  ➢ Pioneering stage\\n  ➢ Rapid growth stage'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='83\\n  ➢ Maturity and stabilization stage\\n  ➢ Declining stage\\nPioneering Stage\\n The prospective demand for the product is promising in this stage and the technology \\nof the product is low. The demand for the product attracts many producers to produce the \\nparticular product. There would be severe competition and only fittest companies survive \\nthis stage. The producers try to develop brand name, differentiate the product and create \\na product image. This would lead to non-price competition too. The severe competition \\noften leads to the change of position of the firms in terms of market shares and profit. In \\nthis situation, it is difficult to select companies for investment because the survival rate is \\nunknown.\\nRapid Growth Stage\\n This stage starts with the appearance of surviving firms from the pioneering stage. \\nThe companies that have withstood the competition grow strongly in market share and \\nfinancial performance. The technology of the production would have improved resulting in \\nlow cost of production and good quality products. The companies have stable growth rate \\nin this stage and they declare dividend to the share holders. It is advisable to invest in the \\nshares of these companies. The pharmaceutical industry has improved its technology and \\nthe top companies in this sector are giving dividend to the shareholders. Likewise power \\nindustry and telecommunication industry can be cited as examples of expansion stage. In \\nthis stage the growth rate is more than the industry’s average growth rate.\\nMaturity and Stabilization Stage\\n \\n In the stabilization stage, the growth rate tends to moderate and the rate of growth \\nwould be more or less equal to the industrial growth rate or the gross domestic product \\ngrowth rate. Symptoms of obsolescence may appear in the technology. The keep going, \\ntechnological innovations in the production process and products should be introduced. \\nThe investors have to closely monitor the events that take place in the maturity stage of the \\nindustry.\\nDeclining Stage\\n In this stage, demand for the particular product and the earnings of the companies \\nin the industry decline. Now-a-days very few consumers demand black and white T.V . '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='84\\ninnovation of new products and change in consumer preferences lead to this stage. The \\nspecific feature of the declining stage is that even in the boom period; the growth of the \\nindustry would be low and decline at a higher rate during the recession. It is better to avoid \\ninvesting in the shares of the low growth industry even in the boom period. Investment in \\nthe shares of these types of companies leads to erosion of capital\\nFactors to be Considered\\n Apart from industry life cycle analysis, the investor has to analyse some other factors \\ntoo. They are as listed below\\n  ➢ Growth of the industry\\n  ➢ Cost structure and profitability\\n  ➢ Nature of the product\\n  ➢ Nature of the competition\\n  ➢ Government policy\\n  ➢ Labour\\n  ➢ Research and development\\nGrowth of the Industry\\n The historical performance of the industry in terms of growth and profitability \\nshould be analysed. Industry wise growth is published periodically by the Centre for \\nMonitoring Indian Economy. The past variability in return and growth in reaction to macro \\neconomic factors provide an insight into the future. Even though history may not repeat \\nin the exact manner, looking into the past growth of the industry, the analyst can predict \\nthe future. The information technology industry has witnessed a tremendous growth in the \\npast so also the scrip prices of the IT industry. With the Y2K millennium bug creating a \\nhuge business opportunity even beyond the year 2000, the sector is expected to maintain its \\ngrowth momentum.\\nCost Structure and Profitability\\n The cost structure, that is the fixed and variable cost, affects the cost of production \\nand profitability of the firm. In the case of oil and natural gas industry and iron and steel \\nindustry the fixed cost portion is high and the gestation period is also lengthy. Higher the \\nfixed cost component, greater sales volume is required to reach the firm’s breakeven point. \\nOnce the breakeven point is reached and the production is on the track, the profitability can '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='85\\nbe increased by utilizing the capacity to full. Once the maximum capacity is reached, again \\ncapital has to invest in the fixed equipment. Hence, lower the fixed cost, adjustability to the \\nchanging demand and reaching the break even points are comparatively easier.\\nNature of the Product\\n The products produced by the industries are demanded by the consumers and other \\nindustries. If industrial goods like pig iron, iron sheet and coils are produced, the demand \\nfor them depends on the construction industry. Likewise, textile machine tools industry \\nproduces tools for the textile industry and the entire demand depends upon the health of \\nthe textile industry. Several such examples can be cited. The investor has to analyse the \\ncondition of related goods producing industry and the end user industry to find out the \\ndemand for industrial goods. \\n In the case of consumer goods industry, the change in the consumers’ preference, \\ntechnological innovations and substitute products affect the demand. A simple example \\nis that the demand for the ink pen is affected by the ball point pen with the change in the \\nconsumer preference towards the easy usage of pen.\\nNature of the Competition\\n Nature of competition is an essential factor that determines the demand for the \\nparticular product, its profitability and the price of the concerned company scrips. The \\nsupply may arise from indigenous producers and multinationals. In the case of detergents, \\nit is produced by indigenous manufactures and distributed locally at a competitive price. \\nThis poses a threat to the company made products. The multinational are also entering \\ninto the field with sophisticated product process and better quality product. Now the \\ncompanies’ ability to withstand the local as well as the multinational competition counts \\nmuch. If too many firms are present in the organized sector, the competition would be \\nsevere. The competition would lead to a decline in the price of the product. The investor \\nbefore investing in the scrip of a company should analyse the market share of the particular \\ncompany’s product and should compare it with the top five companies.\\nGovernment Policy\\n The government policies affect the very nerve of the industry and the effects \\ndiffer from industry to industry. Tax subsidies and tax holidays are provided for export \\noriented products. Government regulates the size of the production and the pricing of \\ncertain products. The sugar, fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries are often affected '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content='86\\nby the inconsistent government polices. Control and decontrol of sugar price affect the \\nprofitability of the sugar industry. In some cases entry barriers are placed by the government. \\nIn the airways, private corporate are permitted to operate the domestic flights only. When \\nselecting an industry, the government policy regarding the particular industry should be \\ncarefully evaluated. Liberalization and delicensing have brought immense threat to the \\nexisting domestic industries in several sectors.\\nLabor\\n The analysis of labor scenario in a particular industry is of great importance. The \\nnumber of trade unions and their operating mode has impact on the labour productivity and \\nmodernization of the industry. Textile industry is known for its militant trade unions. If the \\ntrade unions are strong and strikes occur frequently, it would lead to fall in the production. \\nIn an industry of high fixed cost, the stoppage of production may lead to loss. \\n When trade unions oppose the introduction of automation, in the product market the \\ncompany may stand to lose with high cost of production. The unhealthy labour relationship \\nleads to loss of customers’ goodwill too.\\n Skilled labour is needed for certain industries. In the case of Indian labour market, \\neven in computer technology or in any other industry skilled and well-qualified labour is \\navailable at a cheaper rate. This is one of the many reasons attracting the multinationals to \\nset up companies in India.\\nResearch and Development\\n For any industry to survive the competition in the national and international \\nmarkets, product and production process have to be technically competitive. This depends \\non the R & D in the particular company or industry. Economies of scale and new market \\ncan be obtained only through R & D. the percentage of expenditure made on R & D should \\nbe studied diligently before making an investment.\\nPollution Standards\\n Pollution standards are very high and strict in the industrial sector. For some \\nindustries it may be heavier than others; for example, in leather, chemical and pharmaceutical \\nindustries the industrial effluents are more.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='87\\nSWOT Analysis  \\n The above mentioned factors themselves would become strength, weakness, \\nopportunity and threat (SWOT) for the industry. Hence, the investor should carry out \\na SWOT analysis for the chosen industry. Take for instance, increase in demand for the \\nindustry’s product becomes its strength, presence of numerous players in the market, i.e. \\ncompetition becomes the threat to a particular company in the respective industry. The \\nprogress in the research and development in that particular industry is an opportunity and \\nentry of multinationals in the industry and cheap imports of the particular products are \\nthreat to that industry. In this way the factors have to be arranged and analysed. To make the \\nindustry analysis more explanatory it has been carried out on the pharmaceutical industry \\nand SWOT analysis results are also given.\\nPharmaceutical Industry\\nGrowth of the Industry \\n The industry has witnessed healthy growth in the recent past and investment in \\npharmaceutical industry is continuing. The product output is also increasing and operational \\nand business management efficiency also seem to have improved.

The process is very complex in nature. The processes are classified into primary \\nand secondary. The primary process requires uninterrupted power supply, maintaining of \\nconditions under which the molecules react and yield a new product, excellent manufacturing \\nconditions and well-trained personnel. Specific plants costs less but, they have the risk of '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='88\\nobsolescence. Multipurpose plants are expensive and have no risk of obsolescence but, they \\nhave the risk of cross contamination. The secondary process is the conver sion of bulk drugs \\ninto formulations. The secondary process is not much technology intensive and has low \\ncapital cost. Hence, there are many players in the market.\\nNature of the Product \\nThe products of the pharmaceutical industry are broadly classified into bulk \\ndrugs, formulations and intravenous fluids. Bulk drugs are like Ciproflaxacin, Ibuprofen, \\nRanitidine, Ethanbutol, etc. The major manufactures of the products are Ranbaxy, Cipla, \\nCadilla, Dr.Reddys’ Lab and Lupin. Some companies manufacture formulations from bulk \\ndrugs and market them under brands. Companies also manufacture formulations for \\nother companies. Some of the companies in the formulation segment are Ranbaxy, Cipla, \\nWockhardt, Lupin etc.\\nIntravenous fluids are preparations which aid in quick replenishment of body fluids. \\nBulk drugs and formulations companies produce intravenous fluids also. The formulations \\nare produced by firms from all over the country. Andhra Pradesh stands first in the \\nproduction of bulk drugs.\\nDemand for the Product \\nThe Indian pharmaceutical market which was worth Rs90 billion in 1997, is growing \\nat 13.7% rate. But only three out of ten Indians have access to allopathic drug. Even in this \\nsegment vast majority of them belong to urban area. Investments in medical and public \\nhealth declined from 2% of the total capital outlay in the sixth five year plan to 1.75% in the \\nEighth five year plan. In the year 1996-97, the portion in the annual budget was of 1.7%.\\nThe less than 15 age segment of the population is expected to grow at 0.5% but the \\nfastest growth is expected in the 50-59 groups. This has led to a shift in the demand from \\nthe life saving drugs to life enhancing drugs. It is referred to as a shift from age old diseases \\nto old age diseases.\\nCompetition \\nThe industry is having 2400 players within the organised sector and around 15,000 \\nin small-scale sector.

If the market share is high, the company would \\nbe able to meet the terms of sales in 1997. While analyzing the market share, the size of the \\ncompany also should be considered because the smaller companies may find it difficult to \\nsurvive in the future. The leading companies of today’s market will continue to lead at least \\nin the near future. The companies in the market should be compared with like product \\ngroups otherwise, the results will be misleading. A software company should be compared \\nwith other software companies to select the best in that industry.\\nGrowth of Sales \\nThe company may be a leading company, but if the growth in sales in comparatively \\nlower than another company, it indicates the possibility of the company losing the leadership. \\nThe rapid growth in sales would keep the shareholder in a better position than one with the \\nstagnant growth rate. The company of large size with inadequate growth in sales will not \\nbe preferred by the investors. Growth in sales is usually followed by the growth in profits. \\nInvestor generally prefers size and the growth in sales because the larger size companies \\nmay be able to withstand the business cycle rather than the company of smaller size.\\n The growth in sales of the company is analysed both in rupee terms and in physical \\nterms. Physical term is very essential because it shows the growth in real terms. The rupee \\nterm is affected by the inflation. Companies with diversified sales are compared in rupee \\nterms and percentage of growth over time.\\nStability of Sales \\nIf a firm has stable sales revenue, other things being remaining constant, will have \\nmore stable earning and wide variations in capacity utilization, financial planning and \\ndividend. Periodically all the financial newspapers provide information about the market \\nshare of different companies in an industry. The fall in the market share indicates the \\ndeclining trend of the company, even if the sales are stable in absolute terms. Hence, the \\nstability of sales also should be compared with its market share and the competitors’ market \\nshares.'),\n",

For this purpose, forecast of sales has to be done. He can forecast \\nthe sales in different ways.\\n1. The investor can fit a trend line either linear or nor linear whichever is suitable.\\n2. Historical percentage of company sales to the industry sales can be analysed. Even \\nsimple least square technique could be used to find out the function Cs = f (I) i.e. \\nCs – company sales; I – Industry sales.\\n3. The sales growth can be compared with the macro-economic variables like gross \\ndomestic product, per capita income and population growth.\\n4. The different components of demand for the company’s product have to be analysed \\nbecause the demand may arise from different sources. For some product the demand \\nmay be from the consumers as well as from the industries. For example, steel and \\npetroleum products are demand by consumers and industries.\\n5. The demand for the substitutes and competitors’ product also should be analysed \\nusing least square techniques.\\nEarnings of the Company\\nSales alone do not increase the earnings but the costs and expenses of the company \\nalso influence the earnings of the company. Further, earnings do not always increase with \\nthe increase in sales. The company’s sales might have increased but its earnings per share \\nmay decline due to the rise in costs. The rate of change in earnings differs from the rate \\nof change of sales. Sales may increase by 10% in a company but earnings per share may \\nincrease only by 5%. Even though there is a relationship between sales and earnings, it is not \\na perfect one. Sometimes, the volume of sales may decline but the earnings may improve \\ndue to the rise in the unit price of the article. Hence, the investor should not depend only \\non the sales, but should analyse the earnings of the company.\\nThe income for the company is generated through operating sources and non-\\noperating sources. The sources of operating income vary from industry to industry. For \\nthe service industry no tangible product is involved and income is generated through \\nsales of services. Take the case of commercial bank, its income is the interest on loans and \\ninvestments. Interest income is referred to operating income. But in the case of industries \\nproducing tangible goods earnings arise from the sale of goods.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='94\\nThe companies, in addition to the revenue from sales, may get revenue from other \\nsources too. The non-operating income may be generated from interest from bonds, rentals \\nfrom lease, dividends from securities and sale of assets. The investor should analyse the \\nincome source diligently whether it is from the sale of assets or it is from investments. \\nSometimes earning per share may seem to be attractive in a particular year but in actual \\ncase the revenue generated through sales may be comparatively lower than in the previous \\nyear. The earnings might have been generated through the sale of assets. \\nThe investor should be aware that income of the company may vary due to the \\nfollowing reasons.\\n  ➢ Change in sales\\n  ➢ Change in costs\\n  ➢ Depreciation method adopted\\n  ➢ Depletion of resources in the case of oil, mining, forest products, gas etc.\\n  ➢ Inventory accounting method\\n  ➢ Replacement cost of inventories\\n  ➢ Wages, salaries and fringe benefits\\n  ➢ Income taxes and other taxes.\\nCapital Structure\\nThe equity holders’ return can be increased manifold with the help of financial \\nleverage, i.e., using debt financing along with equity financing. The effect of financial \\nleverage is measured by computing leverage ratios. The debt ratio indicates the position of \\nthe long term and short term debts in the company finance. The debt may be in the form of \\ndebentures and term loans from financial institutions.\\nPreference Shares\\nIn the early days the preference share capital was never a significant source of capital. \\nAt present, many companies resort to preference shares. The preference shares induct some \\ndegree of leverage in finance. The leverage effect of the preference shares is comparatively \\nlesser than the debt because the preference share dividends are not tax deductible. If the \\nportion of preference share in the capital is larger, it tends to create instability in the earnings \\nof the equity shares when the earnings of the company fluctuate. Sometimes the preference \\nshare may be convertible preference share; in that case it dilutes the earnings per share. So \\nthe investor should look into the preference share component of the capital structure.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 98}, page_content='95\\nDebt \\nLong term debt is an important source of finance. It has the specific benefit of \\nlow cost of capital because interest is tax deductible. The leverage effect of debt is highly \\nadvantageous to the equity holders. During the boom period the positive side of the leverage \\neffect increases the earnings of the share holders. At the same time, during recession the \\nleverage effect inducts instability in earnings per share and can lead to bankruptcy. Hence, \\nit is important to limit the debt component of the capital to a reasonable level. The limit \\ndepends on the firm’s earning capacity and its fixed assets.\\ni) Earnings Limit of Debt\\nThe earnings determine whether the debt is excessive or not. The earnings indicate \\nthe probability of insolvency. The ratio used to find out the limit of the debts is the interest \\ncoverage ratio i.e., the ratio of net income after taxes to interest paid on debt. The ratio \\nshows the firm’s ability to pay the interest charges, the number of times interest is covered \\nby earnings.\\nii) Assets Limit to Debt\\nThis asset limit is found out by fixed assets to debt ratio. The financing of fixed assets \\nby the debt should be within a reasonable limit. For industrial units the recommended ratio \\nlevel is below 0.5.\\nManagement\\nGood and capable management generates profit to the investors. The management \\nof the firm should efficiently plan, organize, actuate and control the activities of the \\ncompany. The basic objective of management is to attain the stated objectives of company \\nare achieved, investors will have a profit. A management that ignores profit does more harm \\nto the investors than one that over emphasizes it.\\n The good management depends on the qualities of the manager. Koontz and \\nO’Donnell suggest the following as a special trait of an able manager:\\n  ➢ Ability to get along with people\\n  ➢ Leadership\\n  ➢ Analytical competence'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='96\\n  ➢ Industry\\n  ➢ Judgement\\n  ➢ Ability to get things done\\nSince the traits are difficult to measure, managerial performance is evaluated \\nagainst setting and accomplishing a verifiable objective. If the investor needs greater proof \\nof excellence of management, he has to analyse management ability. The analysis can be \\ncarried out on the following ways:\\na) The background of managerial personnel contributes much to the success of the \\nmanagement. The manager’s age, educational background, advancement within the \\ncompany, levels of responsibility achieved and the activities in the social sphere can \\nbe studied.\\nb) The record of management over the past years has to be reviewed. For several \\ncompanies what the top management have done during its tenure in office are given \\nin the financial weeklies and monthlies along with critical comments. This gives an \\ninsight into the ability of the top management.\\nc) The management’s skill to have market share ahead of others is a proof of managerial \\nsuccess. The investor can rely on this type of management and choose the stock.\\nd) The next criterion the investor should analyse is the company’s strength to expand. A \\nfirm may expand from within and diversify products in the known lines. Sometimes \\nit may acquire an other company to expand its market. The horizontal or vertical \\nexpansion of the production is a health sign of an efficient management.\\ne) The management’s ability to maintain efficient production by proper utilization or \\nplant and machinery has to be analysed. Suitable inventory planning and scheduling \\nhave to be drafted and worked out by the management.\\nf) The management’s capacity to finance the company adequately has to be studied. \\nAccomplishing the financial requirement is a direct reflection of managerial ability. \\nThe management should adopt a realistic dividend policy in relation to earnings. A \\nrealistic dividend policy boosts the image of the company’s stock in the market.\\ng) The functional ability of management to work with employees and union is another \\narea of concern. A union poses a threat to the smooth functioning of the firm. In this \\ncontext the management should be able to maintain harmonious relationship with \\nthe employees and unions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='97\\nh) The management’s adaptability to scientific management and quality control \\ntechniques should be analysed. The management should be able to give due weightage \\nto maintain technical competence.\\nAfter analyzing the above mentioned factors, the investor should select companies \\nthat possess excellent management and maintain the competitive position of the company in \\nthe market. The investor should also remember that the individual traits of a single manager \\nalone cannot make the company profitable and there should be a strong management system \\nto do so.\\nOperating Efficiency\\nThe operating efficiency of a company directly affects the earnings of a company. An \\nexpanding company that maintains high operating efficiency with a low break-even point \\nearns more than the company with high break-even point. If a firm has stable operating \\nratio, the revenues also would be stable. \\nEfficient use of fixed assets with raw materials, labour and management would lead \\nto more income from sales. This leads to internal fund generation for the expansion of the \\nfirm. A growing company should have low operating ratio to meet the growing demand for \\nits product.\\nOperating Leverage\\nIf the firm’s fixed cost is high in the total cost the firm is said to have a high degree \\nof operating leverage. Leverage means the use of a lever to raise a heavy object with a small \\nforce. High degree of operating leverage implies, other factors being held constant, relatively \\nsmall change in sales result in a large change in return on equity. This can be explained with \\nthe help of the following example.\\n Let us take firm A and B. The firm A has relatively small amount of fixed charges \\nsay, ` 40,000. Firm A would not have much automated equipment, so its depreciation and \\nmaintenance costs are low. The variable cost per cent is higher than it would be if the firm \\nused more automated equipment, In the other case firm B has high fixed costs, ` 1,20,000. \\n Here the firm uses automated equipment (with which one operator can turn out \\nmany units at the same labour cost) to a much larger extent. The break-even occurs at \\n40,000 units in firm A and 60,000 units in firm B. The selling price (P) is ` 4; the variable \\ncost is ` 3 for firm A and ` 2 for firm B percent.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='98\\nThe break-even occurs when ROE (return on equity) = 0, and hence, when earnings \\nbefore interest and taxes (EBIT) = 0.\\nEBIT = 0 = PQ – VQ – F\\nHere P is the average sales price per unit of output, Q is units of output, V is the vari -\\nable cost per unit, and F is the fixed operating costs. The break-even quantity is = F / (P-V)\\nFor Firm A = ` 40,000     = 40,000 units\\n  ` 4 – ` 3\\nFirsm B = ` 2,20,000  = 60,000 units\\n  ` 4 – ` 2\\nTo a large extent, operating leverage is determined by technology. For example, \\ntelephone companies, iron and steel companies and electric utilities have heavy investments \\nin fixed assets leading to high fixed costs and operating leverage. On the other hand \\ncosmetics companies, and consumer goods producing companies may need significantly \\nlower fixed costs, and hence lower operating leverage.\\nThe investor should understand the operating leverage of the firm because the \\nfirm with high operating leverage is affected much by the cyclical decline. The operating \\nefficiency of the firm determines the profit expectation of the company.\\nFinancial Analysis\\nThe best source of financial information about a company is its own financial \\nstatements. This is a primary source of information for evaluating the investment prospects \\nin the particular company’s stock. Financial statement analysis is the study of a company’s \\nfinancial statement from various viewpoints. The statement gives the historical and current \\ninformation about the company’s operations.

Financial ratio \\nprovides numerical relationship between two relevant financial data. Financial ratios are \\ncalculated from the balance sheet and loss account. The relationship can be either expressed \\nas a percent or as a quotient. Ratios summarise the data for easy understanding, comparison \\nand interpretation. Financial ratios may be divided into six groups. \\nThey are listed below: \\n  ➢ Liquidity Ratios\\n  ➢ Turnover Ratios\\n  ➢ Leverage Ratios\\n  ➢ Profit Margin Ratios\\n  ➢ Return on Investment Ratios\\n  ➢ Valuation Ratios\\nLiquidity Ratio\\nLiquidity means the ability of the firm to meet its short term obligations. Current \\nratio and acid test ratio are the most popular ratios used to analyse the liquidity. The liquidity \\nratio indicates the liquidity in a rough fashion and the adequacy of the working capital. '),\n",

Compared to that the liquidity \\nposition of Sky Ltd. is favourable. The acid test ratio of 1.06 shows that the company is able \\nto meet current liabilities. Y et, the company has to work out plans to reduce the inventory \\nlevel a little below the present level.\\nTurnover Ratios\\nThe turnover ratios show how well the assets are used the extent of excess inventory, \\nif any. These ratios are also known as activity ratios or asset management ratios. Commonly \\ncalculated ratios are sales to current assets, sales to fixed assets, sales to inventory, receivable \\nto sales and total assets to turnover. Each ratio has a specific application. Sales to current \\nasset ratio shows the utilization of the current assets and sales to fixed asset ratio indicates \\nthe fixed asset utilization. The sales to inventory management.

The \\ndifference between the two ratios is caused by financial leverage. When both the ratios \\nare compared, the ROE is greater than ROA. It indicates that the Sky Ltd has employed \\nborrowed funds efficiently to lever the rate of return to the advantage of shareholders.\\nValuation Ratios\\nThe shareholders are interested in assessing the value of the shares. The value of the \\nshare depends on the performance of the firm and the market factors. The performance \\nof the firm in turn depends on a host of factors. Hence, the valuation ratios provide a \\ncomprehensive measure of the performance of the firm itself. In the subsequent section, \\nsome of the valuation ratios are dealt in detail.\\nBook Value Per Share\\nThis ratio indicates the share of equity shareholders after the company has paid \\nall its liabilities, creditors, debenture holders and preference shareholders. At the time of \\nliquidation, the shareholders can know what remains after making all the payments. In \\nordinary time also it helps the shareholder to find out his real position in the company.\\n Book value per share     =  Eqity share capital + Reserve\\n     Total number of equity shares outstanding\\n OR\\n        =      Networth – Preference share capital\\n     Total number of equity shares outstanding\\n        =    50000 (Rs in lakhs)\\n     2000 (number in lakhs)\\n        = ` 25'),\n",

When \\nthe book value of the share is higher than the par value, it is a healthy sign. The profits and \\naccumulated reserves lead to high book value. Book value may be less for firms having long \\ngestation period and when there are accumulated losses.\\n When the book value of the share is high, companies may issue bonus shares to the \\nexisting shareholders out of the reserves. Right issues also can bring down the book value \\nof the share.\\nDividend to Market Price\\nDividend is the regular income received by the shareholder. The shareholder would \\nlike to know the relationship between the market price and the dividend. Suppose “ A ” \\ncompany pays ` 4 per share and the market value is ` 50. Then\\n Dividend yield  =    Dividend per share      x  100\\n     Market price per share\\n      =  4 x 100 = 8%\\n     50\\n Even though the “ A ” company provides 40 percent dividend its actual yield is low \\nbecause of the high market price. Whenever companies plough back their profits to settle \\nthe loans or for expansion program, the yield would be low. At the same time, if the company \\ndistributes profits to shareholders the yield may be high. This may not be proper indicator. \\nThe earnings per share is treated as a better guide in investment decisions.\\nEarnings Per Share\\nEarnings per share is the earnings after tax divided by the number of common shares \\noutstanding.\\n EPS =     E A T\\n   Number of shares outstanding\\n \\n Lerner and Carleton have given a model for the EPS.\\n EPS =   (I – T) [R + (R – 1) L/E] E\\n   Number of common shares outstanding '),\n",

Most of the news \\npapers along with the stock price quotations give the P/E ratio too. The P/E ratio is the \\nmultiplying factor that the market is willing to offer to the company’s future earnings. In the \\n“ A ” company’s earnings per share is ` 6 and price ` 50, then:\\n Price – Earnings Ratio  = Market price per share\\n         Earnings per share\\n     = ` 50 =   8.33 times\\n      ` 6\\n The P/E of 8.33 means that the market is prepared to pay ` 8.33 for every rupee of \\nfuture earnings. The past performance is the base for the estimate. High P/E ratio indicates \\nhigh expectation of the market regarding the growth of future earnings of the company. The \\nP/E ratio has links with other financial parameters like dividend payout, dividend growth \\nrate and the cost of company’s funds. Large dividend payouts, high dividend growth rates \\nand low cost of funds will result in high P/E ratios.\\n The investors generally compare the P/E ratio of the company with that of the \\nindustry and market. A P/E ratio lower than industry means that the stock is underpriced. \\nInvestors should be careful n comparing the scrip’s P/E with the industry’s P/E because \\nsometimes, the industry P/E may be high due to overheated market. In such a situation, the \\nindustry’s P/E should be moderated to acceptable levels. The investor can also forecast the \\nfuture P/E ratio and compare it with the present P/E to assess the extent of under pricing \\nof the particular share. Forecast can be done by studying fundamental factors and applying \\nstatistical techniques using past P/E data. The comparison of the estimated P/E ratio with \\nthe actual P/E ratio leads to one of these three conclusions given below:\\n1. If the current P/E ratio is larger than the E (P/E) ratio, the stock is overpriced. It is \\nbetter to sell the shares before the fall in price.\\n2. If the current P/E ratio is smaller than the E (P/E) ratio, the stock is underpriced and \\nit could be a best buy with the expectation of the rise in price.\\n3. If the current P/E ratio equals the E(P/E) ratio, the stock is correctly priced. No \\nsignificant changes in prices are likely to occur.'),\n",

The dividend payout \\nhas increased. The earnings per share fluctuates. It has declined from 1997 and showed \\nslight improvement in the year 1999. \\n In spite of the dividends paid, the share prices languished around Ra 50. The specific \\ninformation that reveals the reason is the rate of return on assets. The rate of return on \\nassets has declined from 18.1 % in 1996 to 13.2% in 1999.\\nThe return on assets is the end result of the mixture of events that take place within \\nthe firm. The greater the return on assets, the higher the market value for the firm’s share, \\nother things remaining constant. Every firm tries to maximise the return on the assets, \\nbecause funds are employed in the farm of assets. The return on assets depends on the \\nturnover of assets into sales or intensity of utilization of assets in creating sales. Further, the \\nreturn on assets indicates the productivity of funds.\\nThe margin on sales has declined over the years.

Fundamental approach analyses the \\nshare prices on the basis of economic, industry and company statistics. If the price of the \\nshare is lower than its intrinsic value, investor buys it. But, if he finds the price of the \\nshare higher than the intrinsic value he sells and gets profit. The technical analyst mainly \\nstudies the stock price movement of the security market. If there is an uptrend in the price \\nmovement investor may purchase the scrip. With the onset of fall in price he may sell it and \\nmove from the scrip. Basically, technical analysts and the fundamental analysts aim at good \\nreturn on investment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 131}, page_content='128\\nTechnical Analysis\\nIt is a process of identifying trend reversals at an earlier stage to formulate the buying \\nand selling strategy. With the help of several indicators they analyzed the relationship \\nbetween price - volume and supply-demand for the overall market and the individual stock. \\nVolume is favorable on the upswing i.e. the number of shares traded is greater than before \\nand on the downside the number of shares traded dwindles If it is the other way round, \\ntrend reversals can be expected.\\nAssumptions\\n1) The market value of the scrip is determined by the interaction of supply and demand.\\n2) The market discounts everything. The price of the security quoted represents the \\nhopes, fears and inside information received by the market players. Inside information \\nregarding the issuing of bonus shares and right issues may support the prices. The \\nloss of earnings and information regarding the forthcoming labour problem may \\nresult in fall in price. These factors may cause a shift in demand and supply, changing \\nthe direction of trends.\\n3) The market always moves in trend. Except for minor deviations, the stock prices \\nmove in trends. The price may create definite patterns too. The trend may lie either \\nincreasing or decreasing. The trend continues for some time and then it reverses.\\n4) Any layman knows the fact that history repeats itself. It is true to the stock market \\nalso. In the rising market investors’ psychology have tip beats and they purchase \\nthe shares in greater volumes, driving the prices higher. At the same time, in the \\ndown trend they may be very eager to get out of the market by selling them and thus \\nplunging the share price further. The market technicians assume that past prices \\npredict the future.\\nHistory of Technical Analysis\\nThe technical analysis is based on the doctrine given by Charles H. Dow in 1884, in \\nthe Wall Street Journal. He wrote a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal A.J. Nelson, a \\nclose friend of Charles Dow formalized the Dow Theory for economic forecasting. \\nThe analysts used charts of individual stocks and moving averages in the early \\n1920’s. Later on, with the aid of calculators and computers, sophisticated techniques came \\ninto vogue.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='129\\nTechnical Tools\\nGenerally used technical tools are Dow Theory, volume of trading, short selling, odd \\nlot trading, bars and line charts, moving averages and oscillators. In this section some of the \\nabove mentioned tools are analyzed.\\nDow Theory\\nDow developed his theory to explain the movement of the indices of Dow Jones \\nAverages. He developed the theory on the basis of certain hypotheses. The first hypothesis \\nis that, no single individual or buyer can influence the major trend of the market. \\nHowever, an individual investor can affect the daily price movement by buying or \\nselling huge quantum of particular scrip. The intermediate price movement also can be \\naffected to a lesser degree by an investor.\\nHis second hypothesis is that the market discounts everything. Even natural \\ncalamities such as earthquake, plague and fire also get quickly discounted in the market. \\nThe Pokhran blast affected the share market for a short while and then the market returned \\nback to normalcy.\\nHis third hypothesis is that the theory is not infallible. It is not a tool to beat the \\nmarket but provides a way to understand it better. \\nThe theory According to Dow Theory the trend is divided into primary, intermediate \\nand short term trend. The primary trend may be the broad upward or downward movement \\nthat may last for a year or two. The intermediate trends are corrective movements, which \\nmay last for three weeks to three months. The primary trend may be interrupted by the \\nintermediate trend. The short term trend refers to the day to day price movement. It is also \\nknown as oscillators or fluctuations. These three types of trends are compared to tide, waves \\nand ripples of the sea.\\nTrend\\nTrend is the direction of movement. The share prices can either increase or fall or \\nremain flat. The three directions of the share price movements are called as rising, falling \\nand flat trends. The point to be remembered is that share prices do not rise or fall in a straight \\nline. Every rise or fall in price experiences a counter move. If a share price is increasing, the \\ncountermove will be a fall in price and vice-versa. The share prices move in zigzag manner.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='130\\nThe trend lines are straight lines drawn connecting either the tops or bottoms of the \\nshare price movement. To draw a trend line, the technical analyst should have at least two \\ntops or bottoms. The following figure shows the trend lines.\\nTrend Reversal \\nThe rise or fall in share price cannot go on forever. The share price movement may \\nreverse its direction. Before the change of direction, certain pattern in price movement \\nemerges. The change in the direction of the trend is shown by violation of the trend line. \\nViolation of the trend line means the penetration of the trend line. \\nIf a scrip price cuts the rising trend line from above, it is a violation of trend line \\nand signals the possibility of fall in price. Like – wise if the scrip pierces the trend line from \\nbelow this signal the rise in price.\\nPrimary Trend \\nThe security price trend may be either increasing or decreasing. When the market \\nexhibits the increasing trend, it is called bull market. The bull market shows three clear \\ncut peaks. Each peak is higher than the previous peak. The bottoms are also higher than \\nthe previous bottoms. The reactions following the peak used to halt before the previous \\nbottoms. \\nThe phases leading to the three peaks are revival, improvement in corporate profit \\nand speculation. The revival period encourages more and more investors to buy scrip’s their \\nexpectations about the future being high. In the second phase, increased profits of corporate \\nwould result in further price rise. In the third phase, prices advance due to inflation and \\nspeculation. The figure gives the three phases of bull market. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 134}, page_content='131\\nThe reverse is true with the bear market. Here, the first phase of fall starts with \\nthe abandonment of hopes. The chances of prices moving back to the previous high level \\nseemed to be low. This would result in the sale of shares. In the second phase, companies are \\nreporting lower profits and dividends. This would lead to selling pressure. \\nThe final phase is characterized 1’ the distress sale of shares. During the bear phase \\nof 1996, in the Bombay Stock Exchange more than 2/3 of stocks were inactive. Most of the \\nscrip’s were sold below their par values. The figure gives the bear market. Here the tops \\nand bottoms are lower than the previous ones. The bull and bear phases of the Indian stock \\nmarket are given in Figure.\\nThe Secondary Trend\\nThe secondary trend or the intermediate trend moves against the main trend and \\nleads to correction. In the bull market the secondary trend would result in the fall of \\nabout 33-66% of the earlier rise. In the bear market, the secondary trend carries the price '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 135}, page_content='132\\nupward and corrects the main trend. The correction ivu1d be 33% to 66% of the earlier fall. \\nIntermediate trend corrects the overbought and oversold condition. It provides the space \\nto the market. Compared to the time taken for the primary trend, secondary trend is swift \\nand quicker. \\nMinor Trends\\nMinor trends or tertiary moves are called random wriggles. They are simply the \\ndaily price fluctuations. Minor trend tries to correct the secondary trend movement. It \\nis better for the investors to concentrate on the primary or secondary trends than on the \\nminor trends. The chartist plots the scrip’s price or the market index each day to trace the \\nprimary and secondary trend.\\nSupport and Resistance Level\\nAnybody interested in the technical analysis should know the support and resistance \\nlevel. A support level exists at a price where considerable demand for that stock is expected \\nto prevent further fall in the price level. The fall in the price may be halted for the time \\nbeing or it may result even in price reversal. In the support level, demand for the particular \\nscrip is expected.\\nIn the resistance level, the supply of scrip would be greater than the demand and \\nfurther rise in price is prevented. The selling pressure is greater and the increase in price is \\nhalted for the time being.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 136}, page_content='133\\nSupport and resistance usually occur whenever the turnover of a large number of \\nshares tends to be concentrated at several price levels. When the stock touches a certain \\nlevel and then drops, this is called resistance and if the stock reaches down to certain level \\nand then rises there exists a support. The levels constantly switch from one to another i.e. \\nfrom support to resistance, or from resistance to support. The figures show the support and \\nresistance level.\\nThis can be explained numerically say, for example, if a scrip price hovers around \\n` 150 for some weeks then it may rise and reach ` 210. At this point the price halts and \\nthen falls back. The scrip keeps on falling back to around its original price ` 150 and halts. \\nThen it moves upward. In this case ` 150 becomes the support level. At this point, the scrip \\nis cheap and investors buy it and demand makes the price move upward. Whereas ` 210 \\nbecomes the resistance level, the price is high and there would be selling pressure resulting \\nin the decline of the price.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content='134\\nIf the scrip price reverses the support level and moves downward, it means that \\nthe selling pressure has overcome the potential buying pressure, signaling the possibility \\nof a further fall in the value of the scrip. It indicates the violation of the support level and \\nbearish market.\\nIf the scrip penetrates the previous top and moves above, it is the violation of \\nresistance level. At this point, buying pressure would be more than the selling pressure. \\nIf the scrip was to move above the double top or triple top formation, it indicates bullish \\nmarket.\\nThe support and the resistance level need not be formed only on tops or bottoms. \\nThey can be on the trend lines or gaps of the chart. Gaps are defined as those points or price \\nlevels where the scrip has not changed hands. In the rising or falling price level gaps are \\nformed. If the prices are in the upward move and the high of any day is lower than the next \\nday’s low, the gap is said to have occurred. \\nFor example, if the high price of the Instant Company’s scrip on March 1st is ` 200 \\nand on March 2nd low is 225, a gap is said to have occurred on the bar chart. This indicates \\nthat the stock is not traded between the level ` 200 and ` 225. This gap indicates further \\nrise in price level. Likewise in a falling price, a gap is formed if the low price on day 1 is \\nhigher than the high price of day 2. Suppose the low price on Monday is ` 150 and the high \\nprice on the Tuesday is ` 130, a gap is said to have occurred and indicates that there was no \\ntransaction between the level of ` 150 and ` 130.\\nIndicators\\nTechnical indicators are used to find out the direction of the overall market. The \\noverall market movements affect the individual share price. Aggregate forecasting is \\nconsidered to be more reliable than the individual forecasting. The indicators are price and \\nvolume of trade. The volume of trade is influenced by the behavior of price.\\nVolume of Trade \\nDow gave special emphasis on volume. Volume expands along with the bull market \\nand narrows down in the bear market. If the volume falls with rise in price or vice—versa, \\nit4s-a matter of concern for the investor and the trend may not persist for a longer time. \\nTechnical analyst used volume as an excellent method of confirming the trend. The market \\nis said to be bullish when small volume of trade and large volume of trade follow the fall in \\nprice and the rise in price.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 138}, page_content='135\\n Large rise in price or large fall in price leads to large increase in volume.\\nLarge volume with rise in price indicates bull market and the large volume with fall \\nin price indicates bear market.\\nIf the volumes decline for five consecutive days, then it will continue for another \\nfour days and the same is true in increasing volume.\\nThe Breadth of the Market\\nThe breadth of market is the term often used to study the advances and declines that \\nhave occurred in the stock market. Advances mean the number of shares whose prices have \\nincreased from the previous day’s trading. Declines indicate the number of shares whose \\nprices have fallen from the previous day’s trading.

Short sales refer to \\nthe selling of shares that are not owned. The bears are the short sellers who sell now in the \\nhope of purchasing at a lower price in the future to make profits. The short sellers have to \\ncover up their positions. Short positions of scrips are published in the business newspapers. \\nWhen the demand for a particular share increases, the outstanding short positions also \\nincrease and it indicates future rise of prices. These indications cannot be exactly correct, \\nbut they show the general situations.\\nShort sales of a particular month is selected and compared with the average daily \\nvolume of the preceding month. This ratio shows, how many days of trading it would take \\nto use up total short sales. If the ratio is less than 1, market is said to be weak or overbought \\nand a decline can be expected. The value between 1 and 0.5 shows neutral condition of the \\nmarket. Values above I indicate bullish trend and if it is above 2 the market is said to be \\noversold. At market tops, short selling is high and at market bottoms short selling is low.\\nOdd Lot Trading\\nShares are generally sold in a lot of hundred. Shares, sold in smaller lots, fewer than \\n100 are called odd lot. Such buyers and sellers are called odd lotters.Odd lot purchases to \\nodd lot sales (Purchase % Sales) is the odd lot index. The increase in odd lot purchase results \\nin an increase in the index. Relatively more selling leads to fall in the index. It is generally \\nconsidered that the professional investor is more informed and stronger than the odd lot -\\nters. When the professional investors dominate the market, the stock market is technically \\nstrong. If the odd lotters dominate the market, the market is considered to be technically \\nweak. The notion behind is that odd lot purchase is concentrated at the top of the market \\ncycle and selling at the bottom. High odd lot purchase forecasts fall in the market price and \\nlow purchases/sales ratios are presumed to occur toward the end of bear market.\\nSeveral studies have indicated that the odd lotters do not move into the market at \\nthe peak and move out at bottom. In October 1987, Newyork stock market crashed. During \\nthe weeks prior to the crash contrary to the odd lot theory, odd lotters were selling more \\nshares than they bought when market prices increased. After the crash, odd-lotters sensibly \\nbecame big buyers when stock prices were near their lows. These rational trading patterns \\ndefy the opinion about odd lot theory.'),\n",

The behavior of stock prices is studied with the \\nhelp of different methods such as fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental \\nanalysis seeks to evaluate the intrinsic value of securities by studying the fundamental \\nfactors affecting the performance of the economy, industry and companies. Technical \\nanalysis believes that the past behavior of stock prices gives an indication of the future \\nbehavior. It tries to study the patterns in stock price behavior through charts and predict the \\nfuture movement in prices. There is a third theory on stock price behavior which questions \\nthe assumptions of technical analysis.\\nThe basic assumption in technical analysis is that stock pie movement is quite orderly \\nand not random. The new theory questions this assumption. From the results of several \\nempirical studies on stock price movements, the advocates of the new theory assert that \\nshare price movements are random. The new theory came to be known as Random Walk \\nTheory because of its principal contention that share price movements represent a random \\nwalk rather than an orderly movement.\\nRandom Walk Theory\\nStock price behavior is explained by the theory in the following manner. A change \\noccurs in the price of a stock only because of certain changes in the economy, industry \\nor company. Information about these changes alters the stock prices immediately and \\nthe stock moves to a new level, either upwards or downwards, depending on the type of \\ninformation. This rapid shift to a new equilibrium level whenever new information is \\nreceived is recognition of the fact that all information which is known is fully reflected in \\nthe price of the stock. Further change in the price of the stock will occur only as a result \\nof some other new piece of information which was not available earlier. Thus, according \\nto this theory, changes in stock prices show independent behavior and are dependent on \\nthe new pieces of information that are received but within themselves are independent of \\neach other. Each price change is independent of other price changes because each change is \\ncaused by a new piece of information.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='157\\nThe basic premise in random walk theory is that the information on changes in the \\neconomy, industry and company performance is immediately and fully spread so that all \\ninvestors have full knowledge of the information. There is an instant adjustment in stock \\nprices either upwards or downwards. Thus, the current stock price fully reflects all available \\ninformation on the stock. Therefore, the price of a security two days ago can in no way \\nhelp in speculating the price two days later. The price of each day is independent. It may \\nbe unchanged, higher or lower from the previous price, but that depends on new pieces of \\ninformation being received each day.\\nThe random walk theory presupposes that the stock markets are so efficient \\nand competitive that there is immediate price adjustment. This is the result of good \\ncommunication system through which information can be spread almost anywhere in the \\ncountry instantaneously. Thus, the random walk theory is based on the hypothesis that \\nthe stock markets are efficient. Hence, this theory later came to be known as the efficient \\nmarket hypothesis (EMH) or the efficient market model.\\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis\\nThis hypothesis states that the capital market is efficient in processing information. \\nAn efficient capital market is one in which security prices equal their intrinsic values \\nat all times, and where most securities are correctly priced. The concept of an efficient \\ncapital market has been one of the dominant themes in academic literature since the 1960s. \\nAccording to Elton and Gruber, “when someone refers to efficient capital markets, they \\nmean that security prices fully reflect all available information” . ’ According to Eugene \\nFama,2 in an efficient market, prices fully reflect all available information. The prices of \\nsecurities observed at any time are based on correct evaluation of all information available \\nat that time.\\nThe efficient market model is actually concerned with the speed with which \\ninformation is incorporated into security prices. The technicians believe that past price \\nsequence contains information about the future price movements because they believe that \\ninformation is slowly incorporated in security prices. This gives technicians an opportunity \\nto earn excess returns by studying the patterns in price movements and trading accordingly.\\nFundamentalists believe that it may take several days or weeks before investors can \\nfully assess the impact of new information. As a consequence, the price may be volatile for a \\nnumber of days before it adjusts to a new level. This provides an opportunity to the analyst \\nwho has superior analytical skills to earn excess returns.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='158\\nThe efficient market theory holds the view that in an efficient market, new \\ninformation is processed and evaluated as it arrives and prices instantaneously adjust to \\nnew and correct levels. Consequently, an investor cannot consistently earn excess returns \\nby undertaking fundamental analysis or technical analysis. \\nForms of Market Efficiency\\nThe capital market is considered to be efficient in three different forms: the weak \\nform, semi-strong form and the strong form. Thus, the efficient market hypothesis has been \\nsubdivided into three forms, each dealing with a different type of information. The weak \\nform deals with the information regarding the past sequence of security price movements, \\nthe semi-strong form deals with the publicly available information, while the strong form \\ndeals with all information, both public and private (or inside).\\nThe different forms of efficient market hypothesis have been tested through several \\nempirical studies. The tests of the weak form hypothesis are essentially tests of whether all \\ninformation contained in historical prices of securities is fully reflected in current prices. \\nSemi-strong form tests of the efficient market hypothesis are tests of whether publicly \\navailable information is fully reflected in current stock prices. Finally, strong form tests of \\nthe efficient market hypothesis are tests of whether all information, both public and private \\n(or inside), is fully reflected in security prices and whether any type of investor is able to \\nearn excess returns.\\nEmpirical Tests of Weak Form Efficiency\\nThe weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) says that the current prices \\nof stocks already fully reflect all the information that is contained in the historical sequence \\nof prices. The new price movements are completely random. They are produced by new \\npieces of information and are not related or dependent on past price movements. Therefore, \\nthere is no benefit in studying the historical sequence of prices to gain abnormal returns \\nfrom trading in securities. This implies that technical analysis, which relies on charts of price \\nmovements in the past, is not a meaningful analysis for making abnormal trading profits.\\nThe weak form of the efficient market hypothesis is thus a direct repudiation of \\ntechnical analysis.\\nTwo approaches have been used to test the weak form of the efficient market hy -\\npothesis. One approach looks for statistically significant patterns in security price changes. \\nThe alternative approach searches for profitable short-term trading rules.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='159\\nSerial Correlation Test\\nSince the weak form EMH postulates independence between successive price changes, \\nsuch independence or randomness in stock price movements can be tested by calculating \\nthe correlation between price changes in one period and changes for the same stock in \\nanother period. The correlation coefficient can take on a value ranging from —1 to 1; a \\npositive number indicates a direct relation, a negative value implies an inverse relationship \\nand a value close to zero implies no relationship. Thus, if correlation coefficient is close to \\nzero, the price changes can be considered to be serially independent.\\nRun Test\\n The run test is another test used to test the randomness in stock price \\nmovements. In this test, the absolute values of price changes are ignored; oly the direction \\nof change is considered. An increase in price is represented by + signs. The decrease \\nis represented by – sign. When there is no change in prices, it is represented by ‘O’ . A \\nconsecutive sequence.of the same sign is considered as a run. \\nFor example, the sequence + + + — — — has two runs. In other words, a change of \\nsign indicates a new run. The sequence — — — + + 0 — — — + + + + has five runs; a run of \\nthree — ‘s, followed by a run of two + ‘s, another run of one 0, a fourth run of three — ‘s and \\na fifth run of four + ‘s. In a run test, the actual number of runs observed in a series of stock \\nprice movements is compared with the number of runs in a randomly generated number \\nseries. If no significant differences are found, then the security price changes are considered \\nto be random in nature.\\nFilter Tests\\nIf stock price changes are random in nature, it would be extremely difficult to develop \\nsuccessful mechanical trading systems. Filter tests have been developed as direct tests of \\nspecific mechanical trading strategies to examine their validity and usefulness.\\nIt is often believed that, as long as no new information enters the market, the price \\nfluctuates randomly within two barriers—one lower, and the other higher—around the \\nfair price. When new information comes into the market, a new equilibrium price will be \\ndetermined. If the news is favorable, then the price should move up to a new equilibrium \\nabove the old price. Investors will know that this is occurring when the price breaks through \\nthe old barrier. If investors purchase at this point, they will benefit from the price increase \\nto the new equilibrium level.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 163}, page_content='160\\nLikewise, if the news received is unfavorable, the price of the stock will decline to \\na lower equilibrium level. If investors sell the stock as it breaks the lower barrier, they will \\navoid much of the decline. Technicians set up trading strategies based on such patterns to \\nearn excess returns. \\nThe strategy is called a filter rule. The filter rule is usually stated in the following \\nway: Purchase the stock when it rises by x per cent from the previous low and sell it when \\nit declines by x per cent from the subsequent high. The filters may range from 1 per cent \\nto 50 per cent or more. The alternative to this active trading strategy is the passive buy and \\nhold strategy.\\nThe returns generated by trading according to the filter rule are compared with the \\nreturns earned by an investor following the buy and hold strategy. If trading with filters \\nresults in superior returns that would suggest the existence of patterns in price movements \\nand negate the weak form EMH.\\nDistribution Pattern\\nIt is a rule of statistics that the distribution of random occurrences will conform to \\na normal distribution. Then, if price changes are random, their distribution should also be \\napproximately normal. Therefore, the distribution of price changes can be studied to test \\nthe randomness or otherwise of stock price movements.\\nIn the 1960s the efficient market theory was known as the random walk theory. The \\nempirical studies regarding share price movements were testing whether prices followed a \\nrandom walk.\\nTwo articles by Roberts and Osborne, both published in 1959, stimulated a great \\ndeal of discussion of the new theory then called random walk theory.\\nRoberts’ study compared the movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an \\nAmerican stock market index) with the movement of a variable generated from a random \\nwalk process. He found that the random walk process produced patterns which were very \\nsimilar to those of the Dow Jones index.\\nOsborne’s study found a close resemblance between share price changes and the \\nrandom movement of small particles suspended in a solution, which is known in Physics \\nas the Brownian motion. Both the studies suggested that share price changes are random in \\nnature and that past prices had no predictive value.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 164}, page_content='161\\nDuring the 1960s there was an enormous growth in serial correlation testing. None \\nof these found any substantial linear dependence in price changes. Studies by Moore, Fama \\nand Hagerman and Richmond are some of the early studies in this area. Moore found an \\naverage serial correlation coefficient of — 0.06 for price changes measured over weekly \\nintervals. Fama’s study tested the serial correlation for the thirty stocks comprising the \\nDow Jones industrial average for the five years prior to 1962. The average serial correlation \\ncoefficient was found to be 0.03. Both the coefficients were not statistically different from \\nzero; thus both the studies supported the random walk theory.\\nFama also used run tests to measure dependency. The results again supported the \\nrandom walk theory. Many studies followed Moore’s and Fama’s work each of which used \\ndifferent databases. The results of these studies were much the same as those of Moore and \\nFama.\\nHagerman and Richmond conducted similar studies on securities traded in the \\n‘over- the-counter’ market and found little serial correlation. Serial correlation tests of \\ndependence have also been carried out in various other stock markets around the world. \\nThese have similarly revealed little or no serial correlation. \\nMuch research has also been directed towards testing whether mechanical trading \\nstrategies are able to earn above average returns. Many studies have tested the filter rules for \\nits ability to earn superior returns. Early American studies were those by Alexander, who \\noriginally advocated the filter strategy, and by Fama and Blume. There were similar studies \\nin the United Kingdom by Dryden and in Australia by Praetz. All these studies have found \\nthat filter strategies did not achieve above average returns. Thus, the results of empirical \\nstudies have been virtually unanimous in finding little or no statistical dependence and \\nprice patterns and this has corroborated the weak form efficient market hypothesis\\nEmpirical Tests of Semi-Strong Form Efficiency\\nThe semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis says that current prices \\nof stocks not only reflect all informational content of historical prices, but also reflect all \\npublicly available information about the company being studied. Examples of publicly \\navailable information are—corporate annual reports, company announcements, press \\nreleases, announcements of forthcoming dividends, stock splits, etc. The semi-strong \\nhypothesis maintains that as soon as the information becomes public the stock prices \\nchange and absorb the full information. In other words, stock prices instantaneously adjust \\nto the information that is received.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 165}, page_content='162\\nThe implication of semi-strong hypothesis is that fundamental analysts cannot \\nmake superior gains by undertaking fundamental analysis because stock prices adjust to \\nnew pieces of information as soon as they are received. There is no time gap in which \\na fundamental analyst can trade for superior gains. Thus, the semi-strong hypothesis \\nrepudiates fundamental analysis.\\nSemi-strong form tests deal with whether or not security prices fully reflect all \\npublicly available information. These tests attempt to establish whether share prices react \\nprecisely and quickly to new items of information. If prices do not react quickly and \\nadequately, then an opportunity exists for investors or analysts to earn excess returns by \\nusing this information. Therefore, these tests also attempt to find if analysts are able to earn \\nsuperior returns by using publicly available information.\\nThere is an enormous amount and variety of public information. Semi-strong form \\ntests have been performed with respect to many different types of information. Much of the \\nmethodology used in semi-strong form tests has been introduced by Fama, Fisher, Jensen \\nand Roll. Theirs was the first of the studies that were directly concerned with the testing \\nof the semi-strong form of EMH. Subsequent to their study, a number of refinements have \\nbeen developed in the test procedure.\\nThe general methodology followed in these studies has been to take an economic \\nevent and measure its impact on the share price. The impact is measured by taking the \\ndifference between the actual return and expected return on a security. The expected return \\non a security is generally estimated by using the market model (or single index model) \\nsuggested by William Sharpe. The model used for estimating expected returns is the \\nfollowing:\\n R i  =   ai + biRm + ei\\nWhere\\n R i =  Return on security i.\\n R m =  Return on a market index.\\n a i& bi =  Constants.\\n e i =  Random error.\\nThis analysis is known as Residual analysis. The positive difference between the \\nactual return and the expected return represents the excess return earned on a security. \\nIf the excess return is close to zero, it implies that the price reaction following the public '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='163\\nannouncement of information is immediate and the price adjusts to a new level almost \\nimmediately. Thus, the lack of excess returns would validate the semi-strong form EMH.\\nMajor studies on the impact of capitalization issues such as stock splits and stock \\ndividends have been conducted in the United States by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll \\nand Johnson, in Canada by Finn, and in the United Kingdom by Firth. All these studies \\nfound that the market adjusted share prices instantaneously and accurately for the new \\ninformation. Both Pettit and Watts have investigated the market’s reaction to dividend \\nannouncements. They both found that all the price adjustment was over immediately after \\nthe announcement and thus, the market had acted quickly in evaluating the information.\\nOther items of information whose impact on share prices have been tested include \\nannouncements of purchase and sale of large blocks of shares of a company, takeovers, \\nannual earnings of companies, quarterly earnings, accounting procedure changes, and \\nearnings estimates made by company officials. All these studies which made use of the \\nResidual analysis approach, showed the market to be relatively efficient.\\nBall and Brown tested the stock market’s ability to absorb the informational \\ncontent of reported annual earnings per share information. They found that companies \\nwith good earnings report experienced price increase in stock, while companies with bad \\nearnings report experienced decline in stock prices. But surprisingly, about 85 per cent \\nof the informational content of the earnings announcements was reflected in stock price \\nmovements prior to the release of the actual earnings figure. The market seems to adjust \\nto new information rapidly with much of the impact taking place in anticipation of the \\nannouncement.\\nJoy, Litzenberger and McEnally tested the impact of quarterly earnings \\nannouncements on the stock price adjustment mechanism. Some of their results, however, \\ncontradicted the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. They found that the \\nfavorable information contained in published quarterly earnings reports was not always \\ninstantaneously adjusted in stock prices. This may suggest that the market does not adjust \\nshare prices equally well for all types of information.\\nBy way of summary it may be stated that a great majority of the semi- strong \\nefficiency tests provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis; however, there have \\nbeen some contradictory results too. Most of the reported results show that stock prices do \\nadjust rapidly to announcements of new information and that investors are typically unable \\nto utilize this information to earn consistently above average returns.'),\n",

The \\nstrong form of the efficient market hypothesis maintains that the current security prices \\nreflect all information both publicly available information as well as private or inside \\ninformation. This implies that no information, whether public or inside, can be used to \\nearn superior returns consistently.\\nThe directors of companies and other persons occupying senior management \\npositions within companies have access to much information that is not available to the \\ngeneral public. This is known as inside information. Mutual funds and other professional \\nanalysts who have large research facilities may gather much private information regarding \\ndifferent stocks on their own. These are private information not available to the investing \\npublic at large.\\nThe strong form efficiency tests involve two types of tests. The first type of tests \\nattempt to find whether those who have access to inside information have been able to utilize \\nprofitably such inside information to earn excess returns. The second type of tests examine \\nthe performance of mutual funds and the recommendations of investment analysts to see \\nif these have succeeded in achieving superior returns with the use of private information \\ngenerated by them.\\nJaffe, Lorie and Niederhoffer studied the profitability of insider trading (i.e. the \\ninvestment activities of people who had inside information on companies). They found \\nthat insiders earned returns in excess of expected returns. Although there have been only \\na few empirical studies on the profitability of using inside information, the results show, as \\nexpected, that excess returns can be made. These results indicate that markets are probably \\nnot efficient in the strong form.\\nMany studies have been carried out regarding the performance of American mutual \\nfunds using fairly sophisticated evaluation models. All the major studies have found that \\nmutual funds did no better than randomly constructed portfolios of similar risk. Firth \\nstudied the performance of Unit Trusts in the United Kingdom during the period 1965— \\n75. He also found that unit trusts did not outperform the market index for their given \\nlevels of risk. A small research has been conducted into the profitability of investment \\nrecommendations by investment analysts. Such studies suggest that few analysts or firms of \\nadvisers can claim above average success with their forecasts.'),\n",

Inside information can be used to earn above average returns.\\n2. Mutual funds and investment analysts have not been able to earn superior returns by \\nusing their private information.\\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that the strong form hypothesis is invalid as regards \\ninside information, but valid as regards private information other than inside information.\\nEMH  Vs. Fundamental and Technical Analyses\\nThere are three broad theories concerning stock price movements. These are the \\nfundamental analysis, technical analysis and efficient market hypothesis. Fundamental \\nanalysts believe that by analyzing key economic and financial variables they can estimate \\nthe intrinsic worth of a security and then determine what investment action to take. \\nFundamental analysis seeks to identify under priced securities and overpriced securities. \\nTheir investment strategy consists in buying under priced securities and selling overpriced \\nsecurities, thereby earning superior returns.\\nA technical analyst maintains that fundamental analysis is unnecessary. He believes \\nthat history repeats itself. Hence, he tries to predict future movements in share prices by \\nstudying the historical patterns in share price movements.\\nThe efficient market hypothesis is expressed in three forms. The weak form of the \\nEMH directly contradicts technical analysis by maintaining that past prices and past price \\nchanges cannot be used to forecast future price changes because successive price changes \\nare independent of each other. The semi-strong form of the EMH contradicts fundamental \\nanalysis to some extent by claiming that the market is efficient in the dissemination and \\nprocessing of information and hence, publicly available information cannot be used \\nconsistently to earn superior investment returns.\\nThe strong form of the EMH maintains that not only is publicly available information \\nuseless to the investor or analyst but all information is useless.\\nEven though the EMH repudiates both fundamental analysis and technical analysis, \\nthe market is efficient precisely because of the organized and systematic efforts of thousands \\nof analysts undertaking fundamental and technical analysis. Thus, the paradox of efficient \\nmarket hypothesis is that both fundamental and technical analyses are required to make the \\nmarket efficient and thereby validate the hypothesis.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content='166\\nCompetitive Market Hypothesis\\nAn efficient market has been defined as one where share prices always fully reflect \\navailable information on companies. In practice, no existing stock market is perfectly \\nefficient. There are evident shortcomings in the pricing mechanism. Often, the complete body \\nof knowledge about a company’s prospects is not publicly available to market participants. \\nFurther, the available information would not be always interpreted in a completely accurate \\nfashion. The research studies on EMH have shown that price changes are random or \\nindependent and hence unpredictable. The prices are also seen to adjust quickly to new \\ninformation. Whether the price adjustments are correct and accurate, reflecting correctly \\nand accurately the meaning of publicly available information is difficult to determine. \\nAll that can be validly concluded is that prices are set in a very competitive market, \\nbut not necessarily in an efficient market. This competitive market hypothesis provides \\nscope for earning superior returns by undertaking security analysis and following portfolio \\nmanagement strategies. \\nMarket Inefficiencies\\nMany studies have proved the prevalence of the market efficiency. At the same \\ntime, several studies contradict the concept of market efficiency. For example, the studies \\nconducted Joy, Lichtenberger and Mc. Enally over the period of 1963-1968 gave different \\nresults. The authors have examined the quarterly earnings of the stock prices. The earning \\nof one quarter was compared with the same quarter of the previous year. If the current year’s \\nearnings were 40% or more than the earnings for the same quarter in the previous year, the \\nearnings were classified as good earnings than anticipated. If the current quarter’s earnings \\nwere below 40% of the previous year’s earnings, they are classified as bad than expected.\\nThen the abnormal returns were calculated from 13 weeks prior to the announcement \\nof the earnings to 26 weeks after the announcement of the earnings. The stocks whose earn -\\nings are substantially greater than anticipated gave positive abnormal returns. The stocks \\nwhose earnings are below the anticipated earnings generated negative abnormal returns.\\nThe author’s main claim is that after the announcement of the earnings, stocks \\nthat reported earnings substantially above those of the previous year continued to earn \\npositive abnormal returns. According to the study, the investors could have earned positive \\nabnormal returns of around 6.5 per cent over the next 26 weeks simply by buying stocks \\nthat have reported earnings 40% above the previous quarterly earnings. Meanwhile for \\nthose stocks with earnings substantially below the previous year, the cumulative average '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 170}, page_content='167\\nabnormal return remained relatively stable. This shows evidence against the semi-strong \\nmarket hypothesis because it states that when the information is made public the analyst \\ncould not earn abnormal profits. A study made by C.P . Jones, R. S. Randleman for the \\nperiod 1971-1980 had also given similar results to those of JLM.\\nLow PE effect many studies have provided evidences that stocks with low price \\nearnings ratios yield higher returns than stocks with higher PEs. This is known as low PE \\neffect. A study made by Basu in 1977 was risk adjusted return and even after the adjustment \\nthere was excess return in the low price-earnings stocks. If historical information of P/E \\nratios is useful to the investor in obtaining superior stock returns, the validity of the semi-\\nstrong form of market hypothesis is questioned. His results stated that low P/E portfolio \\nexperienced superior returns relative to the market and high P/E portfolio performed in \\nan inferior manner relative to the overall market. Since his result directly contradicts semi-\\nstrong form of efficient market hypothesis, it is considered to be important.\\nSmall firm effect the theory of the small firm effect maintains that investing in small \\nfirms (those with low capitalization) provides superior risk adjusted returns. Bans found \\nthat the size of the firm has been highly correlated with returns. Bans examined historical \\nmonthly returns of NYSE common stocks for the period 1931-1975. He formed portfolios \\nconsisting of 10 smallest firms and the 10 largest firms and computed the average return for \\nthese portfolios. The small firm portfolio has outperformed the large firm portfolio.\\nSeveral other studies have confirmed the existence of a small firm effect. The size \\neffect has given rise to the doubts regarding the risk associated with small firms. The risk \\nassociated with them is underestimated and they do not trade as frequently as the those \\nof the large firms. Correct measurement of risk and return of small portfolios tends to \\neliminate at least 50% of the small firm effect.\\nThe weekend effect French in his study had examined the returns generated by the \\nStandard and poor Index for each day of the week. Stock prices tend to rise all week long to \\na peak on Fridays. The stocks are traded on Monday at reduced prices, before they begin the \\nnext week’s price rise. Buying on Monday and selling on Friday from 1953 to 1977 would \\nhave generated average annual return 3.4% while simple buy and hold would have yielded \\n5.5% annual return. If the transaction costs are taken into account, the naive buy and hold \\nstrategy would have provided higher return. Y et the knowledge of the weekend effect is \\nstill of v Purchases planned on Thursday or Friday can be delayed until Monday, while sale \\nplanned for Monday can b delayed until the end of the week. The weekend effect is a small \\nbut significant deviation from perfectly random price movements and violates the weekly \\nefficient market hypothesis.'),\n",

The future return \\nexpected from a security is variable and this variability of returns is termed risk. It is rare \\nto find investors investing their entire wealth in a single security. This is because most \\ninvestors have an aversion to risk. It is hoped that if money is invested in several securities \\nsimultaneously, the loss in one will be compensated by the gain in others. Thus, holding \\nmore than one security at a time is an attempt to spread and minimize risk by not putting \\nall our eggs in one basket.\\nMost investors thus tend to invest in a group of securities rather than a single security. \\nSuch a group of securities held together as an investment is what is known as a portfolio. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content='172\\nThe process of creating such a portfolio is called diversification. It is an attempt to spread \\nand minimize the risk in investment. This is sought to be achieved by holding different \\ntypes of securities across different industry groups.\\nFrom a given set of securities, any number of portfolios can be constructed. A \\nrational investor attempts to find the most efficient of these portfolios. The efficiency of \\neach portfolio can be evaluated only in terms of the expected return and risk of the portfolio \\nas such. Thus, determining the expected return and risk of different portfolios is a primary \\nstep in portfolio management. This step is designated as portfolio analysis.\\nExpected Return of a Portfolio\\nAs a first step in portfolio analysis, an investor needs to specify the list of securities \\neligible for selection or inclusion in the portfolio.

For calculating the risk of a portfolio of securities, the \\nriskiness of each security within the context of the overall portfolio has to be considered. \\nThis depends on their interactive risk, i.e. how the returns of a security move with \\nthe returns of other securities in the portfolio and contribute to the overall risk of the \\nportfolio.\\nCovariance is the statistical measure that indicates the interactive risk of a security \\nrelative to others in a portfolio of securities. In other words, the way security returns vary \\nwith each other affects the overall risk of the portfolio.\\nThe covariance between two securities X and Y may be calculated using the following \\nformula:\\n                   [Rx – Rx][Ry - Ry] Covxy =          \\nN\\n    \\nWhere:\\n Cov xy =  Covariance between x and y. \\n R x =  Return of security x.\\n R y =  Return of security y\\n R x =  Expected or mean return of security x.\\n R y =  Expected or mean return of security y. \\n N  =  Number of observations.\\n  n\\n  ∑   i = 1'),\n",

Had \\nthey been negatively correlated, the portfolio risk would have continued to decline as \\nportfolio size increased. Thus, in practice, the benefits of diversification are limited.\\nThe total risk of an individual security comprises two components, the market \\nrelated risk called systematic risk and the unique risk of that particular security called \\nunsystematic risk. By combining securities into a portfolio the unsystematic risk specific \\nto different securities is cancelled out. Consequently, the risk of the portfolio as a whole \\nis reduced as the size of the portfolio increases. Ultimately when the size of the portfolio \\nreaches a certain limit, it will contain only the systematic risk of securities included in the \\nportfolio. The systematic risk, however, cannot be eliminated. Thus, a fairly large portfolio \\nhas only systematic risk and has relatively little unsystematic risk.

Portfolio means \\nthe group of assets an investor owns. The assets may vary from stocks to different types \\nof bonds. Some times the portfolio may consist of securities of different industries. When \\ndifferent assets are added to the portfolio, the total risk tends to decrease. In the case of \\ncommon stocks, diversification reduces the unsystematic risk or unique risk. Analysts \\nopine that if 15 stocks are added in a portfolio of the investor, the unsystematic risk can be \\nreduced to zero. But at the same time if the number exceeds 15, additional risk reduction \\ncannot be gained. But diversification cannot reduce systematic or undiversifiable risk.\\nThe naive kind of diversification is known as simple diversification.

The reason behind this \\nis that the unsystematic price fluctuations are not correlated with the market’s systematic \\nfluctuations.

The investor \\ngets more satisfaction or more utility in X + 1 rupees than from X rupee. \\nIf he is allowed to choose between two certain investments, he would always like to \\ntake the one with larger outcome. Thus, utility increases with increase in return.\\nThe utility function makes certain assumptions about an investors’ taste for risk. \\nThe investors are categorised into risk averse, risk neutral and risk seeking investor. All the \\nthree types can be explained with the help of a fair gamble.\\nIn a fair gamble which cost ` 1, the on are A and B events. A event will yield ` 2. \\nOccurrence of B event is a dead loss i.e 0. The chance of occurrence of both the events are \\n50% and 50%. \\nThe expected value of investment is (1/2) 2 + 1/2 (0) = Rel> the expected value of the \\ngamble is exactly equal to cost. Hence, it is a fair gamble. The position of the investor may, \\nbe improved or hurt by undertaking the gamble.\\nRisk avertor rejects a fair gamble because the disutility of the loss is greater for him \\nthan the utility of an equivalent gain. Risk neutral investor means that he is indifferent to \\nwhether a fair gamble is undertaken or not.\\nThe risk seeking investor would select a fair gamble i.e. he would choose to invest. \\nThe expected utility of investment is higher than the expected utility of not investing. These \\nthree different types of investors are shown in figure.\\nThe curves ABC are three different slopes of utility curves. The upward sloping \\ncurve A shows increasing marginal utility. The straight line B shows constant utility, and \\ncurve C shows diminishing marginal utility. The constant utility, a linear function means \\ndoubling of returns would double the utility and it indicates risk neutral situation. \\nThe increasing marginal utility suggests that the utility increases more than \\nproportion to increase in return and shows the risk lover.

The return from the risk free asset is \\ncertain and the standard deviation of the return is nil. The relationship between the rate of \\nreturn of the risk free asset and risky asset is zero. These types of assets are usually fixed \\nincome securities. But fixed income securities issued by private institutions have the chance \\nof default.

The process of blending together the broad asset classes so as to obtain optimum \\nreturn with minimum risk is called portfolio construction. Diversification of investments \\nhelps to spread risk over many assets. A diversification of securities gives the assurance of \\nobtaining the anticipated return on the portfolio. In a diversified portfolio, some securities \\nmay not perform as expected, but others may exceed the expectation and making the actual \\nreturn of the portfolio reasonably close to the anticipated one. Keeping a portfolio of single \\nsecurity may lead to a greater livelihood of the actual return somewhat different from that of \\nthe expected return. Hence, it is a common practice to diversify securities in the portfolio.\\nApproaches in Portfolio Construction\\nCommonly, there are t approaches in the construction of the portfolio of securities \\nviz, traditional approach and Markowitz efficient frontier approach. In the traditional \\napproach, investor’s needs in terms of income and capital appreciation re evaluated and \\nappropriate securities are selected to meet the needs of the investor. The common practice \\nin the traditional approach is to evaluate the entire financial plan of the individual. In the \\nmodem approach, portfolios are constructed to maximize the expected return for a given \\nlevel of risk. It views portfolio construction in terms of the expected return and the risk \\nassociated with obtaining the expected return.\\nThe Traditional Approach\\nThe traditional approach basically deals with two major decisions. They are:\\n(a)  Determining the objectives of the portfolio.\\n(b)  Selection of securities to be included in the portfolio.\\nNormally, this is carried out in four to six steps. Before formulating the objectives, the \\nconstraints of the investor should be analysed. Within the given frame work of constraints, \\nobjectives are formulated. Then based on the objectives, securities are selected. After that, \\nthe risk and return of the securities should be studied. The investor has to assess the major \\nrisk categories that he or she is trying to minimize. Compromise on risk and non-risk '),\n",

Finally relative portfolio weights are assigned to securities \\nlike bonds, stocks and debentures and then diversification is carried out. The flow chart 4.5 \\nexplains this\\nAnalysis of Constraints \\nThe constraints normally discussed are: income needs, liquidity time harizon, safety, \\ntax considerations and the temperament.\\nIncome Needs \\nThe income needs depend on the need for income in constant rupees and current \\nrupees. The need for income in current rupees arises from the investor’s need to meet all \\nor part of the living expenses. At the same time inflation may erode the purchasing power, \\nthe investor may like to offset the effect of the inflation and so, needs income in constant \\nrupees.\\nSteps In Traditional Approach\\nAnalysis of constraints\\nDetermination of Objectives\\nSelection of Portfolio\\nBond and Common Stock\\nAssessment of risk and return\\nDiversification\\n(a) Need for current\\n \\nIncome The investor should establish the income which the portfolio should \\ngenerate. The current income need depends upon the entire current financial plan of the \\ninvestor. The expenditure required to maintain a certain level of standard of living and \\nthe other entire income generating source should be determined. Once this information is \\narrived at, it is possible to decide how much income must be provided for the port1olio of \\nsecurities.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 213}, page_content='210\\n(b) Need for Constant Income \\nInflation reduces the purchasing power of the money. Hence, the investor estimates \\nthe impact of inflation on his estimated stream of income and tries to build a portfolio \\nwhich could offset the effect of inflation. Funds should be invested in such securities where \\nincome from them might increase at a rate that would offset the effect of inflation. The \\ninflation or purchasing power risk must be recognized but this does not pose a serious \\nconstraint on portfolio if growth stocks are selected.\\nLiquidity \\nLiquidity need of the investment is highly individualistic of the investor. If the \\ninvestor prefers to have high liquidity then funds should be invested in high quality short \\nterm debt maturity issues such as money market funds, commercial papers and shares that \\nare widely traded. Keeping, the funds in shares that are poorly traded or stocks in closely \\nheld business and real estate lack liquidity. The investor should plan his cash drain and the \\nneed for net cash inflows during the investment period.\\nSafety of the Principal \\nAnother serious constraint to be considered by the investor is the safety of the \\nprincipal value at the time of liquidation. Investing in bonds and debentures is safer than \\ninvesting in the stocks. Even among the stocks, the money should be invested in regularly \\ntraded companies of longstanding. Investing money in the unregistered finance companies \\nmay not provide adequate safety\\nTime Horizon \\nTime horizon is the investment-planning period of the individuals. This varies from \\nindividual to individual. Individual’s risk and return preferences are often described in \\nterms of his “life cycle” . The stages of the life cycle determine the nature of investment. The \\nfirst stage is the early career situation. At the career starting point assets are lesser than \\ntheir liabilities. More goods are purchased on credit. His house might have been built with \\nthe help of housing loan scheme. His major asset may be the house he owns. His priority \\ntowards investments may be in the form of savings for liquidity purposes. He takes life \\ninsurance for protecting him from unforeseen events like death and accidents and then he \\nthinks of the investments. The investor is young at this stage and has long horizon of life \\nexpectancy with possibilities of growth in income, he can invest in high-risk and growth \\noriented investments.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 214}, page_content='211\\nThe other stage of the time horizon is the mid-career individual. At this stage, his \\nassets are larger than his liabilities. Potential pension benefits are available to him. By this \\ntime he establishes his investment program. The time horizon before him is not as long as \\nthe earlier stage and he wants to protect his capital investment. He may wish to reduce the \\noverall risk exposure of the portfolio but, he may continue to invest in high risk and high \\nreturn securities.\\nThe final stage is the late career or the retirement stage. Here, the time horizon of \\nthe investment is very much limited. He needs stable income and once he retires, the size of \\nincome he needs from investment also increases. In this stage, most of his loans are repaid by \\nhim and his assets far exceed the liabilities. His pension and life insurance programmes are \\ncompleted by him. He shifts his investment to low return and low risk category investments, \\nbecause safety of the principal is given priority. Mostly he likes to have lower risk with \\nhigh interest or dividend paying component to be included in his portfolio. Thus, the time \\nhorizon puts restrictions on the investment decisions.\\nTax Consideration \\nInvestors in the income tax paying group consider the tax concessions they could \\nget from their investments. For all practical purpose, they would like to reduce the taxes. \\nFor income tax purpose, interests and dividends are taxed under the head “income from \\nother sources” . The capital appreciation is taxed under the head “capital gains” only when \\nthe investor sells the securities and realises the gain. The tax is then at a concessional rate \\ndepending on the period for which the asset has been held before being sold. From the tax \\npoint of view, the form in which the income is received i. e. interest, dividend, short term \\ncapital gains and long term capital gains are important. If the investor cannot avoid taxes, \\nhe can delay the taxes. Investing in government bonds and NSC can avoid taxation. This \\nconstraint makes the investor to include the items which will reduce the tax.\\nTemperament \\nThe temperament of the investor himself poses a constraint on framing his \\ninvestment objectives. Some investors are risk lovers or takers who would like to take up \\nhigher risk even for low return while some investors are risk averse, who may not be willing \\nto undertake higher level of risk even for higher level of return. The risk neutral investors \\nmatch the return and the risk. For example, if a stock is highly volatile in nature then the \\nstock may be selling in a range of ` l00 - 200 and returns may fluctuate. Investors who are \\nrisk averse would find it disturbing and do not have the temperament to invest in this stock. \\nHence, the temperament of the investor plays an important role in setting the objectives.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 215}, page_content='212\\nDetermination of Objectives\\nPortfolios have the common objective of financing present and future expenditures \\nfrom a large pool of assets. The return that the investor requires and the degree of risk he is \\nwilling to take depend upon the constraints. The objectives of portfolio range from income \\nto capital appreciation. The common objectives are stated below\\n => Current income\\n => Growth in income\\n => Capital appreciation\\n => Preservation of capital\\nThe investor in general would like to achieve all the four objectives; nobody \\nwould like to lose his investment. But, it is not possible to achieve all the four objectives \\nsimultaneously. If the investor aims at capital appreciator, he should include risky securities \\nwhere there is an equal likelihood of losing the capital. Thus, there is a conflict among the \\nobjectives.\\nSelection of Portfolio\\nThe selection of portfolio depends on the various objectives of the investor. The \\nselections of portfolio under different objectives are dealt subsequently.\\nObjectives and Asset Mix\\nIf the main objective is getting adequate amount of current income, sixty per cent of \\nthe investment is made on debts and 40 per cent on equities. The proportions of investments \\non debt and equity differ according to the individual’s preferences. Money is invested \\nin short term debt and fixed income securities. Here the growth of income becomes the \\nsecondary objective and stability of principal amount may become the third. Even within \\nthe debt portfolio, the funds invested in short term bonds depends on the need for stability \\nof principal amount in comparison with the stability of income. If the appreciation of capital \\nis given third priority, instead of short term debt the investor opts for long term debt. The \\nmaturity period may not be a constraint.\\nGrowth and Income and Asset Mix\\nHere the investor requires a certain percentage of growth in the e received from \\nhis investment. The investor’s portfolio may consist of 60 to 100 percent equities and 0 to '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 216}, page_content='213\\n40 percent debt instrument. The debt portion of the portfolio may consist of concession \\nregarding tax exemption. Appreciation of principal amount is given third priority. For \\nexample computer software, hardware and non-conventional energy producing company \\nshares provide good possibility of growth in dividend.\\nCapital Appreciation and Asset Mix\\nCapital appreciation and asset mix Capital appreciation means that the value of the \\noriginal investment increases over the years. Investment in real estate’s like land and house \\nmay provide a faster rate of capital appreciation but they lack liquidity. In the capital market, \\nthe values of the shares are much higher than their original issue prices. For example Satyam \\nComputers, share value was ` 306 in April 1998 but in October 1999 the value was ` 1658. \\nLikewise, several examples can be cited. The market capitalisation also has increased. Next \\nto real assets, the stock markets provide best opportunity for capital appreciation. If the \\ninvestor’s objective is capital appreciation, 90 to 100 per cent of his portfolio may consist of \\nequities and 0-10% of debts. The growth of income becomes the secondary objective.\\nSafety of Principal and Asset Mix \\nUsually, the risk averse investors are very particular about the stability of principal. \\nAccording to the life cycle theory, people in the third stage of life also give more importance \\nto the safety of the principal. All the investors have this objective in their mind. No one \\nlikes to lose his money invested in different assets. But, the degree may differ. The investor’s \\nportfolio may consist more of debt instruments and within the debt portfolio more would \\nbe on short term debts.\\nRisk and Return Analysis \\nThe traditional approach to portfolio building has some basic assumptions. First, \\nthe individual prefers larger to smaller returns from securities. To achieve this goal, the \\ninvestor has to take more risk. The ability to achieve higher returns is dependent upon \\nhis ability to judge risk and his ability to take specific risks. The risks are namely interest \\nrate risk, purchasing power risk, financial risk and market risk. The investor analyses the \\nvarying degrees of risk and constructs his portfolio. At first, he establishes the minimum \\nincome that he must have to avoid hardships under most adverse economic condition and \\nthen he decides risk of loss of income that can be tolerated. The investor makes a series \\nof compromises on risk and non-risk factors like taxation and marketability after he has \\nassessed the major risk categories, which he is trying to minimize.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 217}, page_content='214\\nDiversification\\n Once the asset mix is determined and the risk and return are analysed, the final \\nstep is the diversification of portfolio. Financial risk can be minimized by commitments \\nto top-quality bonds, but these securities offer poor resistance to inflation. Stocks provide \\nbetter inflation protection than bonds but are more vulnerable to financial risks. Good \\nquality convertibles may balance the financial risk and purchasing power risk. According to \\nthe investor’s need for income and risk tolerance level portfolio is diversified. In the bond \\nportfolio, the investor has to strike a balance between the short term and long term bonds. \\nShort term fixed income securities offer more risk to income and long term fixed income \\nsecurities offer more risk to principal. In the stock portfolio, he has to adopt the following \\nsteps which are shown in the following figure: \\nSelection of Industries\\nSelection of Companies in the Industry\\nDetermining the size of participation\\n The investor has to select the industries appropriate to his investment objectives. \\nEach industry corresponds to specific goals of the investor. The sales of some industries like \\ntwo wheelers and steel tend to move in tandem with the business cycle, the housing industry \\nsales move counter cyclically. If regular income is the criterion then industries, which resist \\nthe trade cycle should be selected. Likewise, the investor has to select one or two companies \\nfrom each industry. The selection of the company depends upon its growth, yield, expected \\nearnings, past earnings, expected price earning ratio, dividend and the amount spent \\non research and development. Selecting the best company is widely followed by all the \\ninvestors but this depends upon the investors’ knowledge and perceptions regarding the \\ncompany. The final step in this process is to determine the number of shares of each stock \\nto be purchased. This involves determining the number of different stocks that is required \\nto give adequate diversification. Depending upon the size of the portfolio, equal amount is \\nallocated to each stock. The investor has to purchase round lots to avoid transaction costs.\\nModern Approach\\n The traditional approach is a comprehensive financial plan for the individual. It \\ntakes into account the individual needs such as housing, life insurance and pension plans. \\nBut these types of financial planning approaches are not done in the Markowitz approach. \\nMarkowitz gives more attention to the process of selecting the portfolio. His planning can '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 218}, page_content='215\\nbe applied more in the selection of common stocks portfolio than the bond portfolio. The \\nstocks are not selected on the basis of need for income or appreciation. But the selection is \\nbased on the risk and return analysis. Return includes the market return and dividend. The \\ninvestor needs return and it may be either in the form of market return or dividend. They \\nare assumed to be indifferent towards the form of return.\\n From the list of stocks quoted at the Bombay Stock Exchange or at any other regional \\nstock exchange, the investor selects roughly some group of shares say of 10 or 15 stocks. \\nFor these stocks’ expected return and risk would be calculated. The investor is assumed to \\nhave the objective of maximizing the expected return and minimising the risk. Further, it \\nis assumed that investors would take up risk in a situation when adequately rewarded for \\nit. This implies that individuals would prefer the portfolio of highest expected return for \\na given level of risk. In the modern approach, the final step is asset allocation process that \\nis to choose the portfolio that meets the requirement of the investor. The risk taker i.e. \\nwho are willing to accept a higher probability of risk for getting the expected return would \\nchoose high risk portfolio. Investor with lower tolerance for risk would choose low level risk \\nportfolio. The risk neutral investor would choose the medium level risk portfolio.\\nManaging the Portfolio \\n After establishing the asset allocation, the investor has to decide how to manage \\nthe portfolio over time. He can adopt passive approach or active approach towards the \\nmanagement of the portfolio. In the passive approach the investor would maintain the \\npercentage allocation for asset classes and keep the security holdings within its place over \\nthe established holding period. In the active approach the investor continuously assess the \\nrisk and return of the securities within the asset classes and changes them. He would be \\nstudying the risks (1) market related (2) group related and (3) security specific and changes \\nthe components of the portfolio to suit his objectives.\\nConstruction of the Optimal Portfolio\\n After determining the securities to be selected, the portfolio manager should find \\nout how much should be invested in each security. The percentage of funds to be invested \\nin each security can be estimated as follows:\\n'),\n",

It is a model of linear general equilibrium return. In the \\nCAPM theory, the required rate return of an asset is having a linear relationship with asset’s \\nbeta value i.e. undiversifiable or systematic risk.\\nAssumptions\\n1. An individual seller or buyer cannot affect the price of a stock. This assumption is \\nthe basic assumption of the perfectly competitive market.\\n2. Investors make their decisions only on the basis of the expected returns, standard \\ndeviations and co variances of all pairs of securities.\\n3. Investors are assumed to have homogenous expectations during the decision-making \\nperiod.\\n4. The investor can lend or borrow any amount of funds at the riskless rate of interest. \\nThe riskless rate of interest is the rate of interest offered for the treasury bills or \\nGovernment securities.\\n5. Assets are infinitely divisible. According to this assumption, investor could buy any \\nquantity of share i.e. they can even buy ten rupees worth of Reliance Industry shares.\\n6. There is no transaction cost i.e. no cost involved in buying and selling of stocks.\\n7. There is no personal income tax. Hence, the investor is indifferent to the form of \\nreturn either capital gain or dividend.\\n8. Unlimited quantum of short sales is allowed. Any amount of shares an individual can \\nsell short.\\nLending and Borrowing \\n Here, it is assumed that the investor could borrow or lend any amount money at \\nriskless rate of interest. When this opportunity is given to the investors, they can mix \\nrisk free assets with the risky assets in a portfolio to obtain a desired rate of risk-return \\ncombination.\\nRp  = Portfolio return\\nXf  = the proportion of funds invested in risk free assets'),\n",

The capital asset pricing theory explains the return of the securities on the \\nbasis of their respective betas. According to the previous models, the investor chooses the \\ninvestment on the basis of expected return and variance. The alternative model developed \\nin asset pricing by Stephen Ross is known as Arbitrage Pricing Theory. The APT theory \\nexplains the nature of equilibrium in the asset pricing in a less complicated manner with \\nfewer assumptions compared to CAPM.\\nArbitrage\\n Arbitrage is a process of earning profit by taking advantage of differential pricing for \\nthe same asset. The process generates riskless profit. In the security market, it is of selling \\nsecurity at a high price and the simultaneous purchase of the same security at a relatively \\nlower price. \\n Since the profit earned through arbitrage is riskless, the investors have the incentive \\nto undertake this whenever an opportunity arises. In general, some investors indulge \\nmore in this type of activities than others. However, the buying and selling activities of \\nthe arbitrageur reduce and eliminate the profit margin, bringing the market price to the \\nequilibrium level.\\nThe Assumptions\\n1. The investors have homogenous expectations.\\n2. The investors are risk averse and utility maximisers.\\n3. Perfect competition prevails in the market and there is no transaction cost.\\n The APT theory does not assume (1) single period investment horizon, (2) no taxes \\n(3) investors can borrow and lend at risk free rate of interest and (4) the selection of the \\nportfolio is based on the mean and variance analysis. These assumptions are present in the \\nCAPM theory.'),\n",

He also likes to keep \\nthe risk at the same level. For example, the investor holds A, B and C securities and he wants \\nto change the proportion of the securities without any additional financial commitment. \\nNow the change in proportion of securities can be denoted by X A, XB, and XC. The increase \\nin the investment in security A could be carried out only if he reduces the proportion of \\ninvestment either in B or C because it has already stated that the investor tries to earn \\nmore income without increasing his financial commitment. Thus, the changes in different \\nsecurities will add up to zero. This is the basic requirement of an arbitrage portfolio. If X \\nindicates the change in proportion,\\n ΔX A + Δ XB + ΔXC = 0\\n The factor sensitivity indicates the responsiveness of a security’s return to a \\nparticular factor. The sensitiveness of the securities to any factor is the weighted average \\nof the sensitivities of the securities, weights being the changes made in the proportion. For \\nexample b A, bB and b are the sensitivities, in an arbitrage portfolio the sensitivities become \\nzero.\\n h AΔXA +bBΔXB +bcΔXc = 0\\n The investor holds the A, B and C stocks with the following returns and sensitivity \\nto changes in the industrial production.

Chen, Roll \\nand Ross have taken four macro economic variables and tested them. According to them \\nthe factors are inflation, the term structure of interest rates, risk premium and industrial \\nproduction. Inflation affects the discount rate or the required rate of return and the size \\nof the future cash flows.

The difference between the return on the high grade bonds and low grade (more \\nrisky) bonds indicates the market’s reaction to risk. The industrial production represents \\nthe business cycle. Changes in the industrial production have an impact on the expectations \\nand opportunities of the investor. The real value of the cash flow is also affected by it.\\n Burmeister and McElroy have estimated the sensitivities with some other factors. \\nThey are given below \\n  ➢ Default risk\\n  ➢ Time premium\\n  ➢ Deflation\\n  ➢ Change in expected sales\\n  ➢ The market returns not due to the first four variables.\\n The default risk is measured by the difference between the return on long term \\ngovernment bonds and the return on long terms bonds issued by corporate plus one-half \\nof one per cent. Lime premium is measured by the return on long term government bonds \\nminus one month Treasury bill rate one month ahead. \\n Deflation is measured by expected inflation at the beginning of the month minus \\nactual inflation during the month. According to then, the first four factors accounted 25% \\nof the variation in the Standard and 1or Composite Index and all the four co-efficient were \\nsignificant.\\n Salomon Brothers identified five factors in their fundamental factor model. Inflation \\nis the only common factor identified by others. The other factors are given below\\n  ➢ Growth rate in gross national product\\n  ➢ Rate of interest\\n  ➢ Rate of change in oil prices\\n  ➢ Rate of change in defence spending\\n All the three sets of factors have some common characteristics.

When only one factor is taken into consideration, the APT can be stated as:\\n R i = λ0 + bi λi\\nIt is similar to the capital market line equation\\n R  = R f + ß (R m —Rf)\\nWhich is similar to the CAPM model?\\n APT is more general and less restrictive than CAPM. In APT, the investor has no \\nneed to bold the market portfolio because it does not make use of the market portfolio \\nconcept. The portfolios are constructed on the basis of the factors to eliminate arbitrage \\nprofits. APT is based on the law of one price to hold for all possible portfolio combinations.\\n The APT model takes into account of the impact of numerous factors on the security. \\nThe macro economic factors are taken into consideration and it is closer to reality than \\nCAPM.\\n The market portfolio is well defined conceptually. In APT model, factors are not well \\nspecified. Hence the investor finds it difficult to establish equilibrium relationship. The well \\ndefined market portfolio is a significant advantage of the CAPM leading to the wide usage \\nof the model in the stock market.\\n The factors that have impact on one group of securities may not affect another group \\nof securities. There is a lack of consistency in the measurements of the APT model.\\n Further, the influences of the factors are not independent of each other.

The evaluation of the portfolio provides a feed back about the \\nperformance to evolve better management strategy. Even though evaluation of portfolio \\nperformance is considered to be the last stage of investment process, it is a continuous \\nprocess. The managed portfolios are commonly known as mutual funds. Various managed \\nportfolios are prevalent in the capital market. Their relative merits of return and risk criteria \\nhave to be evaluated.\\nMutual Fund\\n Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools together funds from investors to \\npurchase stocks, bonds or other securities. An investor can participate in the mutual fund \\nby buying the units of the fund. Each unit is backed by a diversified pool of assets, where the \\nfunds have been invested. A closed-end fund has a fixed number of units outstanding. It is \\nopen for a specific period. During that period investors can buy it. The initial offer period \\nis terminated at the end of the pre-determined period. The closed-end schemes are listed \\nin the stock exchanges. The investor can trade the units in the stock markets just like other \\nsecurities. The prices may be either quoted at a premium or discount.\\n In the open-end schemes, units are sold and bought continuously. The investors can \\ndirectly approach the fund managers to buy or sell the units. The price of the unit is based \\non the net asset value of the particular scheme. The net asset value of the fund is the value \\nof the underlying securities of the scheme. The net asset value is calculated on a daily or \\nweekly basis. \\n The gain or loss made by the mutual fund is passed on to the investors after deducting \\nthe administrative expenses and investment management fees, The gains are distributed to \\nthe unit holder in the form of dividend or reinvested by the fund to generate further gains.\\n The mutual fund may be with or without a load factor. A commission or charge paid \\nby the investors while purchasing or selling the mutual fund is known as load factor. Front-\\nend load is charged when units are sold by the funds and back-end load is charged when \\nthe units are repurchased by the funds. The front-end load factor reduces the units when '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='253\\nthe investor buys it and the back-end load reduces the investor’s proceeds when he sells \\nthe units. Generally, the load factor ranges between 1 and 6 per cent of the net asset value. \\nSometimes, the fund may not charge both the loads.\\nAdvantages of Mutual Funds\\n The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), a non- profit organization serving \\nthe cause of mutual funds, has listed the following advantages to the investors in mutual \\nfunds.\\n1. Professional Management \\n Experienced fund managers supported by a research team, select appropriate \\nsecurities to the fund. The forecasting of the market is done effectively.\\n2. Diversification \\n Mutual funds invest in a diverse range of securities and over many industries. Hence, \\nall the eggs are not placed in one basket. Normally an investor has to have large sum of \\nmoney to achieve this objective, if he invests directly in the stock market. Through mutual \\nfunds, he can achieve diversification of portfolio at a fraction of the cost.\\n3. Convenient Administration \\n For the investors there is reduction in paper work and saving in time. It is also \\nvery convenient. Mutual funds help in overcoming the problems relating to bad deliveries, \\ndelayed payments and the like.\\n4. Return Potential \\n Medium and the long term mutual funds have the potential to provide high returns.\\n5. Low Costs \\n The funds handle the investments of a large number of people, they are in a position \\nto pass on relatively low brokerage and other costs. This is because the funds can take \\nadvantage of the economies of scale.'),\n",

In open-end schemes, the investor can get back \\nhis money at any time by selling back the units to the fund at NAV related prices. In closed-\\nend fund, he has the option to sell the units through the stock exchange.\\n7. Transparency \\n Mutual funds provide information on each scheme about the specific investments \\nmade there under and so on.\\n8. Flexibility \\n Currently most funds have regular investment plans, regular withdrawal plans and \\ndividend reinvestment schemes. A great deal of flexibility is assured in the process.\\n9.

Fluctuations that occur in the equity prices cause substantial \\ngain or loss to the investors. The investor should have competence and skill in the revision \\nof the portfolio. Normally the average investor dislikes to sell in the bull market with the \\nanticipation of further rise. Likewise, he is reluctant to buy in the bear market with the \\nanticipation of further fall.\\nThe portfolio management process needs frequent changes in the composition of \\nstocks and bonds. In securities, the type of securities to be held should be revised according \\nto the portfolio policy. If the policy of investor shifts from earnings to capital appreciation, \\nthe stocks should be revised accordingly. An investor can sell his shares if the price of \\nshares reaches the historic high prices. Likewise, if the security does not fulfill the investor’s \\nexpectation regarding return and growth, it is better to get rid of it. The investor should also \\nconsider the factors like risk, quality and tax concessions. If another stock offers a competitive \\nedge over the present stock, investment should be shifted to the other stock. Many investors \\nfind themselves inadequate in their ability to trade and earn profit. Mechanical methods are \\nadopted to earn better profit through proper timing. Such types of mechanical methods are \\nFormula Plans and Swaps.\\nPassive Management\\nPassive management is a process of holding a well diversified portfolio for a long \\nterm with the buy and hold approach. Passive management refers to the investor’s attempt \\nto construct a portfolio that resembles the overall market returns. The simplest form of \\npassive management is holding the Index fund that is designed to replicate a good and well \\ndefined index of the common stock such as BSE-Sensex or NSE-Nifty. The fund manager \\nbuys every stock in the index in exact proportion of the stock in that index. If Reliance \\nIndustry’s stock constitutes 5% of the index, the fund also invests 5% of its money in Reliance \\nIndustry stock.\\nThe problem in the index fund is the transaction cost. If it is NSE-Nifty, the manager \\nhas to buy all the 50 stocks in market proportion and cannot leave the stocks with smallest \\nweights to save the transaction costs. Further, the reinvestment of the dividends also poses '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 267}, page_content='264\\na problem. Here, the alternative is to keep the cash in hand or to invest the money in stocks \\nincurring transaction cost. Keeping away the stock of smallest weights and the money in \\nhand fail to replicate the index fund in the proper manner. The commonly used approaches \\nin constructing an index fund are as follows:\\n1. Keeping each stock in proportion to its representation in the index\\n2. Holding a specified number of stocks for example 20, which historically track the \\nindex in the best manner.\\n3. Holding a smaller set of stocks to match the index in a pre-specified set of \\ncharacteristics. This may be in terms of sector, industry and the market capitalisation.\\nActive Management\\nActive Management is holding securities based on the forecast about the future. \\nThe portfolio managers who pursue active strategy with respect to market components are \\ncalled ‘market timers’ . The portfolio managers vary their cash position or beta of the equity \\nportion of the portfolio based on the market forecast. The managers may indulge in ‘group \\nrotation’s. Here, the group rotation means changing the investment in different industries’ \\nstocks depending on the assessed expectations regarding their future performance.\\nStocks that seem to be best bets or attractive are given more weights in the portfolio \\nthan their weights in the index. For example, Information Technology or Fast Moving \\nConsumer Goods industry stocks may be given more weights than their respective weights \\nin the NSE-50. At the same time, stocks that are considered to be less attractive are given \\nlower weights compared to their weights in the index. \\nHere, the portfolio manager may either remain passive with respect to market and \\ngroup components but active in the stock selection process or he may be active in the \\nmarket, group and stock selection process.\\nThe Formula Plans\\nThe formula plans provide the basic rules and regulations for the purchase and sale \\nof securities. The amount to be spent on the different types of securities is fixed. The amount \\nmay be fixed either in constant or variable ratio. This depends on the investor’s attitude \\ntowards risk and return. The commonly used formula plans are rupee cost averaging, \\nconstant rupee value, the constant ratio and the variable ratio plans. The formula plans help \\nto divide the investible fund between the aggressive and conservative portfolios.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 268}, page_content='265\\nThe aggressive portfolio consists more of common stocks which yield high return \\nwith high risk. The aggressive portfolio’s return is volatile because the share prices generally \\nfluctuate. The conservative portfolio consists of more bonds that have fixed rate of returns. \\nIt is called conservative portfolio because the return is certain and the risk is less. The \\nconservative portfolio serves as a cushion for the volatility of the aggressive portfolio. The \\ncapital appreciation in the conservative portfolio is rather slow and the fall in price of the \\nbond or debenture is also alike.\\nAssumptions of the Formula Plan\\n1. The first assumption is that certain percentage of the investor’s fund is allocated to \\nfixed income securities and common stocks. The proportion of money invested in \\neach component depends on the prevailing market condition. If the stock market is \\nin the boom condition lesser funds are allotted to stocks. Perhaps it may be a ratio of \\n80 per cent to bonds and 20 per cent to stocks in the portfolio. If the market is low, \\nthe proportion may reverse. In a balanced fund, 50 per cent of the fund is invested in \\nstocks and 50 per cent in bonds.\\n2. The second assumption is that if the market moves higher, the proportion of stocks in \\nthe portfolio may either decline or remain constant. The portfolio is more aggressive \\nin the low market and defensive when the market is on the rise.\\n3. The third assumption is that the stocks are bought and sold whenever there is a \\nsignificant change in the price. The changes in the level of market could be measured \\nwith the help of indices like BSE-Sensitive Index and NSE-Nifty.\\n4. The fourth assumption requires that the investor should strictly follow the formula \\nplan once lie chooses it. He should not abandon the plan but continue to act on the \\nplan.\\n5. The investors should select good stocks that move along with the market. They \\nshould reflect the risk and return features of the market. The stock price movement \\nshould be closely correlated with the market movement and the beta value should be \\naround 1.0. The stocks of the fundamentally strong companies have to be included \\nin the portfolio.\\nAdvantages of the Formula Plan\\n  ➢ Basic rules and regulations for the purchase and sale of securities are provided. \\n  ➢ The rules and regulations are rigid and help to overcome human emotion. \\n  ➢ The investor can earn higher profits by adopting the plans.'),\n",

The selection of the \\nsecurity has to be done either on the basis of the fundamental or technical analysis.\\n  ➢ It is strict and not flexible with the inherent problem of adjustment.\\n  ➢ The formula plan should be applied for long periods, otherwise the transaction cost \\nmay be high.\\n  ➢ Even if the investor adopts the formula plan, he needs forecasting. Market forecasting \\nhelps him to identify the best stocks.\\nRupee Cost Averaging\\nThe simplest and most effective formula plan is rupee cost averaging. First, stocks \\nwith good fundamentals and long term growth prospects should be selected. Such stocks’ \\nprices tend to be volatile in the market and provide maximum benefit from rupee cost \\naveraging. Secondly, the investor should make a regular commitment of buying shares at \\nregular intervals. Once he makes a commitment, he should purchase the shares regardless of \\nthe stock’s price, the company’s short term performance and the economic factors affecting \\nthe stock market.\\nIn the rupee cost averaging plan, the investor buys varying number of shares at \\nvarious points of the stock market cycle. In a way, it can be called time diversification. Let us \\nassume that an investor decides to buy Rs11000 worth of particular shares for four quarters \\nin one particular year, ignoring the transaction costs.

The constant rupee plan starts with a fixed amount of money invested in selected \\nstocks and bonds. When the price of the stocks increases, the investor sells sufficient amount \\nof stocks to return to the original amount of the investment in stocks. By keeping the value \\nof aggressive portfolio constant, remainder is invested in the conservative portfolio.\\nThe investor must choose action points or revaluation points. The action points \\nare the times at which the investor has to readjust the values of the stocks in the portfolio. \\nStocks’ values cannot be continuously the same and the investor has to be watchful of the \\nmarket price movements. Stocks’ value in the portfolio can be allowed to fluctuate to a \\ncertain extent. Percentage change in price like 5%, 10% or 20% can be fixed by the investor. \\nAllowing only small percentage change would result in a lot of transaction cost and would \\nnot be beneficial to the investor. If the action points are too large, the investor may not be \\nable get full benefit out of the price fluctuations.

He makes quarterly adjustment if the \\nstock portion falls or rises by 20%. In the third quarter, the stock prices fell by 20% initiating \\nthe action. He shifted ` 2000 from the bonds’ portion and bought 50 shares. This lifted the \\nvalue of stock portion again to ` 10,000.'),\n",

In this action point the investor disposes off the shares and shifts the money to \\nthe bond portion. By this the stock amount in the portfolio has remained constant but the \\ntotal portfolio value has increased. The investor stands to gain by the total portfolio value \\nappreciation.\\nThe major advantage of this plan is that purchase and sales are determined \\nautomatically. This facilitates the investor to earn capital gain by selling the stocks when the \\nprice increases and buying it at a relatively lower price. To make the plan operate effectively, \\nat the starting point, stocks should not be purchased either at high prices or at too low \\nprices. If the investor starts the purchase at the extreme price level, the stock fund\\nmay be either too small or too large.\\nConstant Ratio Plan\\nConstant ratio plan attempts to maintain a constant ratio between the aggressive and \\nconservative portfolios. The ratio is fixed by the investor. The investor’s attitude towards \\nrisk and return plays a major role in fixing the ratio. The conservative investor may like to \\nhave more of bond and the aggressive investor, more of stocks. Once the r$io is fixed, it is \\nmaintained as the market moves up and down. As usual, action points may be fixed by the \\ninvestor. It may vary from investor to investor. As in the previous example, when the stock \\nprice moves up or down by 10 to 20 per cent action would be taken. Here, 10 per cent is \\ntaken as action point.

But this approach does not eliminate the \\nnecessity of selecting individual security.\\nThe limitation of the plan is that the money is shifted from the stock portion to bond \\nportion. Bond is also a capital market instrument and responds to market pressures. Bond \\nand share prices may both rise and fall at the same time. In the downtrend both prices may \\ndecline and then gain.\\nVariable Ratio Plan\\nAccording to this plan, at varying levels of market price, the proportions of the \\nstocks and bonds change. Whenever the price of the stock increases, the stocks are sold and \\nnew ratio is adopted by increasing the proportion of defensive or conservative portfolio. \\nTo adopt this plan, the investor is required to estimate a long term trend in the price of the \\nstocks. Forecasting is very essential to this plan. When there is a wide fluctuation variable \\nratio plan is useful. The table explains the variable ratio plan.\\nVariable Ratio Plan\\nShare \\nprice \\n(`)\\nValue of Stock \\nportion ( `)\\nValue of \\nDefensive \\n(`)\\nTotal \\nPortfolio \\nvalue ( `)\\nStock as a \\nPercentage of \\nPortfolio ( `)\\nPortfolio \\nAdjustment\\nShares in \\nStock Portion \\n(`)\\n100 10,000 10,000 20,000 50.00 - 100\\n90 9,000 10,000 19,000 47.37 - 100\\n80 8,000 10,000 18,000 44.4 - 100\\n80 12,640 5,400 18,040 70.06 Bought 58 \\nshares 158\\n90 14,220 5,400 19,620 72.48 - 158\\n100 15,800 5,400 21,200 74.53 Sold 50 \\nshares 158\\n100 10,800 10,800 21,600 50.00 - 108\\nIn the above example, the portfolio is adjusted for every 20 per cent change in the \\nstock price. This adjustment criterion may be different for different investors depending \\nupon their attitude towards risk and return. The portfolio is divided into two equal portions \\nas in the case of other plans, with R,10,000 in each.

As the market \\nprice for the stock reaches a 20 per cent decline, that is to Rs,80, the adjustment action takes '),\n",

Once again, \\nwhen there is a 20 per cent change, the adjustment action is triggered. When the prices \\nhave increased to ` 100, the investor sells 50 shares and the stock portion in the portfolio is \\nreduced back to 50 per cent.\\nThe figure explains the variable ratio plan.\\nThe middle line is the trend line that represents the investor’s expectation about of \\nfuture course of prices. Zone 1 and 3 represent respectively of 10 and 20 per cent deviations \\nabove the expected trend, and zones 2 and 4 represent respectively 10 and 20 per cent \\ndeviations below the expected trend. Starting at ` 50, the portfolio’s bonds and stocks ratio \\nis 50:50. \\nAt point A, the portfolio is adjusted to the next proportion, in this case 60 per cent \\nbonds and 40 per cent stocks. At B, again it is 50:50. Below point C there would be more \\nstocks than bonds. Because of the decline in stock price, more stocks are purchased. Above \\nthe point D, it is again 50:50. The line moves closer to the trend line\\nAdvantages  \\nAutomatically, the investor tends to correct his portfolio portions according to the \\nprice changes. The investor is not emotionally affected by the price changes in the market. \\nWith accurate forecast the variable ratio plan takes greater advantage of price fluctuations \\nthan the constant ratio plan.'),\n",

The investor has to construct the appropriate zones and trend for alterations of the \\nproportions\\n2. The selection of security has to be done by the investor by analysing the merits of the \\nstock. The plan does not help in the selection of scrips.\\n3. If the zones are too small frequent changes have to be done and it would limit \\nportfolio performance. \\nRevision and the Cost\\nWith the passage of time the stocks which were attractive once may turn out to be \\nless attractive in terms of return. The investor’s attitude towards risk and return also may \\nchange and the forecast regarding the market also may undergo change. In this context, the \\nnecessary revision is thought of by the portfolio manager. In revision of traded volumes the \\nportfolio manager has to incur brokerage commission, price impact and bid-ask spread. \\nPrice impact means the effects on the price of stock. In simple terms, if the size of the trade \\nis heavy on the buying side, the prices of the stock may increase. The bid-ask spread is the \\ndifference between the price that the market maker is willing to buy and sell the stock. \\nThese costs may be higher in small size stocks and the benefits of revision may be nullified \\nby it. Usually revision is done with the view of either increasing the expected return of the \\nportfolio or to reduce the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio.\\nSW APS\\nSwap is a contract between two parties to exchange a set of cash flows over a pre-\\ndetermined period of time. The two parties are known as counter parties. In an equity \\nswap one counter party, say ‘ A ’ , agrees to pay cash based on the rate of return of an agreed \\nstock market index to the second counter party ‘B’ . Since the payments are based on the \\nmarket index, they vary according to index movements. The second counter party B agrees \\nto pay the fixed amount of cash payments based on the current interest rate to the first \\ncounterparty A. Thus, the payment depends upon the underlying security. This agreement \\nmeans that A has sold stocks and bought bonds while B has sold bonds and bought stocks. \\nHere, they have restricted their portfolios without the transaction costs, even though they \\nhave to pay the swap fee to the swap bank that set up the contract between the two parties.\\nThis can be explained with the help of an example.

It has \\nencouraged us to retain the approach in order to explain corporate finance to students \\nand professionals. There are four key features that distinguish this book from the many \\nother corporate finance textbooks available on the market today:\\ntOur strong belief that financial analysis is part of corporate finance. Pierre Vernimmen, \\nwho was mentor and partner to some of us in the practice of corporate finance, \\nunderstood very early on that a good financial manager must first be able to analyse a \\ncompany’s economic, financial and strategic situation, and then value it, while at the \\nsame time mastering the conceptual underpinnings of all financial decisions.\\nt Corporate Finance is neither a theoretical textbook nor a practical workbook. It is \\na book in which theory and practice are constantly set off against each other, in the \\nsame way as in our daily practice as investors at Monestier capital, DGPA and as \\nM&A director at Alstom, as board members of several listed and unlisted companies, \\nand as teachers at HEC Paris and Bocconi business schools.\\nt Emphasis is placed on concepts intended to give you an understanding of situations, \\nrather than on techniques, which tend to shift and change over time. We confess to \\nbelieving that the former will still be valid in 20 years’ time, whereas the latter will, \\nfor the most part, be long forgotten!\\nt Financial concepts are international, but they are much easier to grasp when they are \\nset in a familiar context. We have tried to give examples and statistics from all around \\nthe world to illustrate the concepts.\\nThe five sections\\nThis book starts with an introductory chapter reiterating the idea that corporate financiers \\nare the bridge between the economy and the realm of finance. Increasingly, they must play \\nthe role of marketing managers and negotiators. Their products are financial securities \\nthat represent rights to the firm’s cash flows. Their customers are bankers and investors. A \\ngood financial manager listens to customers and sells them good products at high prices. \\nA good financial manager always thinks in terms of value rather than costs or earnings.'),\n",

We are amazed at the extent to \\nwhich large numbers of investors neglected this approach during the latest stock market \\neuphoria. When share prices everywhere are rising, why stick to a rigorous approach? For \\none thing, to avoid being caught in the crash that inevitably follows.\\nThe return to reason has also returned financial analysis to its rightful place as a \\ncornerstone of economic decision-making. To perform financial analysis, you must first \\nunderstand the firm’s basic financial mechanics (Chapters 2–5). Next you must master the \\nbasic techniques of accounting, including accounting principles, consolidation techniques \\nand certain complexities (Chapters 6–7), based on international (IFRS) standards now \\nmandatory in over 80 countries, including the EU (for listed companies), Australia, South \\nAfrica and accepted by the SEC for US listing. In order to make things easier for the new-\\ncomer to finance, we have structured the presentation of financial analysis itself around its \\nguiding principle: in the long run, a company can survive only if it is solvent and creates \\nvalue for its shareholders. To do so, it must generate wealth (Chapters 9 and 10), invest \\n(Chapter 11), finance its investments (Chapter 12) and generate a sufficient return (Chap-\\nter 13). The illustrative financial analysis of the Italian appliance manufacturer Indesit will \\nguide you throughout this section of the book.\\nSection II  reviews the basic theoretical knowledge you will need to make an \\nassessment of the value of the firm. Here again, the emphasis is on reasoning, which in \\nmany cases will become automatic (Chapters 15–19): efficient capital markets, the time \\nvalue of money, the price of risk, volatility, arbitrage, return, portfolio theory, present \\nvalue and future value, market risk, beta, etc. Then we review the major types of finan-\\ncial securities: equity, debt and options, for the purposes of valuation, along with the \\ntechniques for issuing and placing them (Chapters 20–25).\\nSection III , is devoted to value, to its theoretical foundations and to its compu-\\ntation. Value is the focus of any financier, both its measure and the way it is shared. \\nOver the medium term, creating value is, most of the time, the first aim of managers \\n(Chapters 26–31).\\nIn Section IV, “Corporate financial policies”, we analyse each financial decision in \\nterms of:\\ntvalue in the context of the theory of efficient capital markets;\\nt balance of power between owners and managers, shareholders and debtholders \\n(agency theory);\\nt communication (signal theory).\\nSuch decisions include choosing a capital structure, investment decisions, cost of capital, \\ndividend policy, share repurchases, capital increases, hybrid security issues, etc.\\nIn this section, we draw your attention to today’s obsession with earnings per share, \\nreturn on equity and other measures whose underlying basis we have a tendency to \\nforget and which may, in some cases, be only distantly related to value creation. We have \\ndevoted considerable space to the use of options (as a technique or a type of reasoning) in \\neach financial decision (Chapters 32–39).\\nWhen you start reading Section V, “Financial management”, you will be ready to \\nexamine and take the remaining decisions: how to create and finance a start up, how \\nto organise a company’s equity capital and its governance, buying and selling companies, '),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Chapter 1\\nWHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE ?\\nTo whet your appetite . . .\\nThe primary role of the financial manager is to ensure that his company has a sufficient \\nsupply of capital.\\nThe financial manager is at the crossroads of the real economy, with its industries \\nand services, and the world of finance, with its various financial markets and structures.\\nThere are two ways of looking at the financial manager’s role:\\nt a buyer of capital who seeks to minimise its cost, i.e. the traditional view;\\nt a seller of financial securities who tries to maximise their value. This is the view we \\nwill develop throughout this book. It corresponds, to a greater or lesser extent, to \\nthe situation that exists in a capital market economy, as opposed to a credit-based \\neconomy.\\nAt the risk of oversimplifying, we will use the following terminology in this book:\\nt the financial manager or chief financial officer (CFO) is responsible for financing \\nthe firm and acts as an intermediary between the financial system’s institutions and \\nmarkets, on the one hand, and the company, on the other;\\nt the business manager invests in plants and equipment, undertakes research, hires \\nstaff and sells the firm’s products, whether the firm is a manufacturer, a retailer or a \\nservice provider;\\nt the financial investor invests in financial securities. More generally, the financial \\ninvestor provides the firm with financial resources, and may be either an equity inves-\\ntor or a lender.\\nSection 1.1\\nTHE FINANCIAL MANAGER IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A SALESMAN  . . .\\n1/ THE FINANCIAL MANAGER ’S JOB IS NOT ONLY TO  “BUY ” FINANCIAL\\nRESOURCES  . . .\\nThe financial manager is traditionally perceived as a buyer of capital. He negotiates with a \\nvariety of investors – bankers, shareholders, bond investors – to obtain funds at the lowest \\npossible cost.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='CORPORATE FINANCE2\\nTransactions that take place on the capital markets are made up of the following \\nelements:\\nta commodity: money,\\nt a price: the interest rate in the case of debt; dividends and capital gains in the case \\nof equities.\\nIn the traditional view, the financial manager is responsible for the company’s financial \\nprocurement. His job is to minimise the price of the commodity to be purchased, i.e. the \\ncost of the funds he raises.\\nWe have no intention of contesting this view of the world. It is obvious and is con-\\nfirmed every day, in particular in the following types of negotiations:\\ntbetween corporate treasurers and bankers, regarding interest rates and value dates \\napplied to bank balances (see Chapter 49);\\nt between chief financial officers and financial market intermediaries, where nego-\\ntiation focuses on the commissions paid to arrangers of financial transactions (see \\nChapter 25).\\n2/ . . . BUT ALSO TO SELL FINANCIAL SECURITIES\\nThat said, let’s now take a look at the financial manager’s job from a different angle:\\nthe is not a buyer but a seller;\\nt his aim is not to reduce the cost of the raw material he buys but to maximise a sell-\\ning price;\\nt he practises his art not on the capital markets, but on the market for financial instru-\\nments, be they loans, bonds, shares, etc.\\nWe are not changing the world here; we are merely looking at the same market from \\nanother point of view:\\ntthe supply of financial securities corresponds to the demand for capital;\\nt the demand for financial securities corresponds to the supply of capital;\\nt the price, the point at which the supply and demand for financial securities are in \\nequilibrium, is therefore the value of security . In contrast, the equilibrium price \\nin the traditional view is considered to be the interest rate, or the cost of funds.\\nWe can summarise these two ways of looking at the same capital market in the following \\ntable:\\nAnalysis/Approach Financial approach: ﬁnancial \\nmanager as salesman\\nTraditional approach: ﬁnancial \\nmanager as purchaser\\nMarket Securities Capital\\nSupply Issuers Investors\\nDemand Investors Issuers\\nPrice Value of security Interest rate'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Chapter 1 WHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE ? 3\\nDepending on your point of view, i.e. traditional or financial, supply and demand are \\nreversed, as follows:\\ntwhen the cost of money – the interest rate, for example – rises, demand for funds is \\ngreater than supply. In other words, the supply of financial securities is greater than \\nthe demand for financial securities, and the value of the securities falls;\\nt conversely, when the cost of money falls, the supply of funds is greater than demand. \\nIn other words, the demand for financial instruments is greater than their supply and \\nthe value of the securities rises.\\nThe cost of capital and the value of the securities vary in opposite directions. We can \\nsummarise with the following theorem, fundamental to this entire book:\\nMinimising ﬁnancing cost is synonymous with maximising the value of the underlying \\nsecurities.\\nFor two practical reasons, one minor and one major, we prefer to present the financial \\nmanager as a seller of financial securities.\\nThe minor reason is that viewing the financial manager as a salesman trying to sell \\nhis products at the highest price casts his role in a different light. As the merchant does \\nnot want to sell low-quality products but products that respond to the needs of his custom-\\ners, so the financial manager must understand his capital suppliers and satisfy their needs \\nwithout putting the company or its other capital suppliers at a disadvantage. He must sell \\nhigh-quality products at high prices . But he can also repackage his product to better \\nmeet investor expectations. Indeed, financial markets are subject to fashion: in one period \\nconvertible bonds (see Chapter 2) can be easily placed; in another period it will be syndi-\\ncated loans (see Chapter 21) that investors will welcome.\\nThe more important reason is that when a financial manager applies the traditional \\napproach of minimising the cost of the company’s financing too strictly, erroneous deci-\\nsions may easily follow. The traditional approach can make the financial manager short-\\nsighted, tempting him to take decisions that emphasise the short term to the detriment of \\nthe long term.\\nFor instance, choosing between a capital increase, a bank loan and a bond issue with \\nlowest cost as the only criterion reflects flawed reasoning. Why? Because suppliers of cap-\\nital, i.e. the buyers of the corresponding instruments, do not all face the same level of risk.\\nThe investor’s risk must be taken into account in evaluating the cost of a source of \\nﬁnancing.\\nThe cost of two sources of financing can be compared only when the suppliers of the \\nfunds incur the same level of risk.\\nAll too often we have seen managers or treasurers assume excessive risk when choos-\\ning a source of financing because they have based their decision on a single criterion: the \\nrespective cost of the different sources of funds. For example:\\ntincreasing short-term debt on the pretext that short-term interest rates are lower than \\nlong-term rates can be a serious mistake;\\nt granting a mortgage in return for a slight decrease in the interest rate on a loan can be \\nvery harmful for the future;\\nt increasing debt systematically on the sole pretext that debt costs less than equity \\ncapital jeopardises the company’s prospects for long-term survival.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='CORPORATE FINANCE4\\nWe will develop this theme further throughout the third part of this book, but we \\nwould like to warn you now of the pitfalls of faulty financial reasoning. The most dan-\\ngerous thing a financial manager can say is, “It doesn’t cost anything.” This sentence \\nshould be banished and replaced with the following question: “What is the impact \\nof this action on value?”\\nSection 1.2\\n . . . OF FINANCIAL SECURITIES  . . .\\nLet’s now take a look at the overall concept of a financial security, the product created by \\nthe financial manager.\\n1/ ISSUANCE OR CREATION OF SECURITIES\\nThere is a great variety of financial instruments, each of which has the following \\ncharacteristics:\\ntit is a contract . . .\\nt . . . executed over time, and . . .\\nt its value derives solely from the series of cash flows it represents.\\nIndeed, from a mathematical and more theoretical viewpoint, a financial instrument is \\ndefined as a schedule of future cash flows.\\nHolding a financial security is the same as holding the right to receive the cash flows, \\nas defined in the terms and conditions of the issue that gave rise to the financial instru-\\nment. Conversely, for the issuer, creating a financial instrument is the same as committing \\nto paying out a series of cash flows. In return for this right to receive cash flows or for \\ntaking on this commitment, the company will issue a security at a certain price, enabling \\nit to raise the funds needed to run its business.\\nA ﬁnancial security is a contract . . . \\nYou’ve undoubtedly heard people say that the financial manager’s stock-in-trade is \\n“paper”. Computerisation has now turned financial instruments from paper documents \\ninto intangible book entries, reducing them to the information they contain, i.e. the con-\\ntract. The essence of finance is, and will always be, negotiation between an issuer seeking \\nnew funds and the investors interested in buying the instruments that represent the under-\\nlying obligations. And negotiation means markets, be they credit markets, bond markets, \\nstock markets, etc.\\n. . . executed over time . . . \\nTime, or the term of the financial security, introduces the notion of risk. A debt instrument \\nthat promises cash flows over time, for example, entails risk, even if the borrower is very \\ncreditworthy. This seems strange to many people who consider that “a deal is a deal” or \\n“a man’s word is his bond”. Yet, experience has shown that a wide variety of risks can \\naffect the payment of those cash flows, including political risk, strikes, natural disasters \\nand other events.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Chapter 1 WHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE ? 5\\n. . . and materialised by cash ﬂows.\\nFurther on in this book you will see that financial logic is used to analyse and choose \\namong a firm’s investment options. The financial manager transforms flows of goods \\nand services, deriving from the company’s industrial and other business assets, into cash \\nflows. You will soon understand that the world of finance is one of managing rights on \\nthe one hand and commitments on the other, both expressed in terms of cash flows.\\nIn a market for financial instruments, it is not the actual flows that are sold, but the \\nrights associated with them. The investor, i.e. the buyer of the security, acquires the rights \\ngranted by the instrument. The issuing company assumes contractual obligations deriving \\nfrom the instrument, regardless of who the owner of the instrument is.\\nFor example, commodity futures markets make it possible to perform purely finan-\\ncial transactions. You can buy sugar “forward”, via financial instruments called futures \\ncontracts, knowing full well that you will never take delivery of the sugar into your ware-\\nhouse. Instead, you will close out the position prior to maturity. The financial manager \\nthus trades on a market for real goods (sugar), using contracts that can be unwound prior \\nto or at maturity.\\nA property investor acts similarly. After acquiring real property, the value of which \\nfluctuates, he can lease it or resell it. Viewed this way, real property is as fungible as any \\nother property and is akin to a financial asset.\\nClearly, these assets exhibit different degrees of “financiality”. To take the argument \\none step further, you turn a painting into a financial instrument when you put it in your \\nsafe in the hope of realising a gain when you sell it.\\nThe distinction between a real asset and a financial asset is therefore subtle but fun-\\ndamental. It lies either in the nature of the contract or in the investor’s motivation, as in \\nthe example of the painting.\\nLastly, the purchase of a financial security differs from the purchase of a durable \\ngood in that the financial security is undifferentiated. A large number of investors can buy \\nthe same financial security. In contrast, acquiring a specific office building or building an \\nindustrial plant is a very specific, unique investment.\\nIn conclusion, every ﬁnancial instrument represents a series of cash ﬂows to be received \\naccording to a set timetable. Mathematically, it can be expressed as a series of future \\ncash ﬂows F1, F2, F3, F4 . . ., Fn over n periods.\\n2/ TYPES OF FINANCIAL SECURITIES\\n(a) Debt instruments (Chapters 20 and 21)\\nThe simplest financial instrument is undoubtedly the contract that ties a lender (investor) \\nto a borrower (company). It represents a very strong commitment, not only to repay, but \\nto repay with interest. Loans become financial securities when they are made negotiable \\non a secondary market (see page 7) and “listed”. Bonds and commercial paper fall into \\nthis category.\\nA bond is a negotiable debt security representing a fraction of a borrowing con-\\ntracted by a company, a financial institution or a sovereign state (gilts in the UK, Bunds \\nin Germany, etc.).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='CORPORATE FINANCE6\\nCommercial paper is a negotiable debt security representing a fraction of a short-\\nterm borrowing (generally between one day and two years) contracted by a company. \\nIf the company is a bank, the security will be called a certificate of deposit. Short-term \\nsovereign debt instruments go by different names depending on the country; in Spain, for \\nexample, they are called Bonos del Estado, while they are called Treasury Bills in the US.\\nStrictly speaking, investors in these securities do not assume any industrial risk. \\nTheir return is set contractually and may be fixed or floating (i.e. variable). If it is float-\\ning, it will be indexed on an interest rate and not on the results of the company.\\nIn Chapter 21 we will see that the lender nevertheless assumes certain risks, namely \\nthe failure of the borrower to honour the debt contract.\\n(b)Equity securities (Chapter 22)\\nEquity represents the capital injected into a company by an investor who bears the full \\nrisk of the company’s industrial undertakings in return for a share of the profits.\\nIf the company is organised under a limited liability structure, the equity is divided \\ninto shares. The risk borne by the shareholders is limited to the amount they contribute to \\nthe firm. Unless otherwise noted, we will be dealing in this book with finance as it relates \\nto the various forms of “limited companies”.\\nShareholders’ equity is a source of financing for the enterprise, but the related finan-\\ncial security, the share, guarantees the investor neither a fixed level of income nor repay-\\nment. The shareholder can realise his investment only by selling it to someone else. The \\ninvestor obtains certain corporate rights, however: a claim on the company’s earnings and \\n– via his voting rights – management oversight.\\n(c)Other securities (Chapter 24)\\nAs you will discover in Chapter 24, financial engineering specialists have invented \\nhybrid securities that combine the characteristics of the two categories discussed above. \\nSome securities have the look and feel of equity from the point of view of the company, \\nbut the corresponding cash flows are fixed, at least partially. Others instruments have \\nyields that are dependent on the performance of the company, but are considered loans, \\nnot equity capital. Financial imagination knows no bounds. Keep in mind that these \\ninstruments are like the cherry on the top. As such, we won’t tempt you with them until \\nChapter 24!\\nThere is a specific type of financial instrument, however, the option, whose associ-\\nated cash flows are actually less “important” to the investor than the rights the option \\nconveys. This instrument grants the right, but not the obligation, to do something.\\nIn sum, financial instruments carry a wide spectrum of characteristics, which, from \\nthe investor’s point of view, ranges from rights to commitments.\\nSection 1.3\\n . . . VALUED CONTINUOUSLY BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS\\nOur view of finance can take shape only in the context of well-developed financial mar-\\nkets. But before examining the technical characteristics of markets (Section II of this \\nbook), let’s spend a moment on definitions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Chapter 1 WHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE ? 7\\n1/ FROM THE PRIMARY MARKET TO THE SECONDARY MARKET\\nOnce launched by its issuer, a ﬁnancial security lives a life of its own. It is sold from one \\ninvestor to another, and it serves as support for other transactions. The instrument itself \\nevolves, but the terms of the contract under which it was issued do not.\\nThe life of a financial security is intimately connected with the fact that it can be bought \\nor sold at any moment. For example, shares issued or created when a company is founded \\ncan later be floated on a stock exchange, just as long-term bonds may be used by specula-\\ntors for short-term strategies.\\nThe new issues market (i.e. creation of securities) is called the primary market. \\nSubsequent transactions involving these securities take place on the secondary market.\\nBoth markets, like any market, are defined by two basic elements: the product (the \\nsecurity) and the price (its value).\\nFrom the point of view of the company, the distinction between the primary and sec-\\nondary markets is fundamental. The primary market is the market for “new” financial \\nproducts, from equity issues to bond issues and everything in between. It is the market \\nfor newly-minted financial securities where the company can raise fresh money.\\nConversely, the secondary market is the market for “used” financial products. \\nSecurities bought and sold on this market have already been created and are now simply \\nchanging hands, without any new securities being created.\\nThe primary market enables companies, financial institutions, governments and local \\nauthorities to obtain financial resources by issuing securities. These securities are then \\nlisted and traded on secondary markets. The job of the secondary market is to ensure that \\nsecurities are properly priced and traded. This is the essence of liquidity: facilitating the \\npurchase or sale of a security.\\nThe distinction between primary and secondary markets is conceptual only. The two \\nmarkets are not separated from each other. A given financial investor can buy either exist-\\ning shares or new shares issued during a capital increase, for example.\\nIf there is often more emphasis placed on the primary market, it is because the func-\\ntion of the financial markets is, first and foremost, to ensure equilibrium between financ-\\ning needs and the sources of finance. Secondary markets, where securities can change \\nhands, constitute a kind of financial “innovation”.\\n2/ THE FUNCTION OF THE SECONDARY MARKET\\nFinancial investors do not intend to remain invested in a particular asset indefinitely. From \\nthe moment they buy a security (or even before), they begin thinking about how they will \\nexit. As a result, they are constantly evaluating whether they should buy or sell such and \\nsuch an asset.\\nMonetising is relatively easy when the security is a short-term one. All the investor \\nhas to do is wait until maturity. The need for an exit strategy grows with the maturity of \\nthe investment and is greatest for equity investments, whose maturity is unlimited. The \\nonly way a shareholder can exit his investment is to sell his shares to someone else.\\nAs an example, the successful business person who floats his company on the stock \\nexchange, thereby selling part of his shares to new shareholders, diversifies his own port-\\nfolio, which before flotation was essentially concentrated in one investment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='CORPORATE FINANCE8\\nThe secondary market makes the investor’s investments liquid.\\nLiquidity refers to the ability to convert an instrument into cash quickly and without loss \\nof value. It affords the opportunity to trade a financial instrument at a “listed” price and in \\nlarge quantities without disrupting the market. An investment is liquid when an investor \\ncan buy or sell it in large quantities without causing a change in its market price.\\nThe secondary market is therefore a zero-sum game  between investors, because \\nwhat one investor buys, another investor sells. In principle, the secondary market operates \\ncompletely independently from the issuer of the securities.\\nA company that issues a bond today knows that a certain amount of funds will \\nremain available in each future year. This knowledge is based on the bond’s amortisa-\\ntion schedule. During that time, however, the investors holding the bonds will have \\nchanged.\\nSecondary market transactions do not show up in macroeconomic statistics on capi-\\ntal formation, earning them the scorn of some observers who claim that the second-\\nary market does nothing to further economic development, but only bails out the initial \\ninvestors.\\nWe believe this thinking is misguided and reflects great ignorance about the function \\nof secondary markets in the economy. Remember that a financial investor is constantly \\ncomparing the primary and secondary markets. He cares little whether he is buying a \\n“new” or a “used” security, so long as they have the same characteristics.\\nThe secondary market plays the fundamental role of valuing securities.\\nIn fact, the quality of a primary market for a security depends greatly on the quality of \\nits secondary market. Think about it: who would want to buy a financial security on the \\nprimary market, knowing that it will be difficult to sell it on the secondary market?\\nThe secondary market determines the price at which the company can issue its secu-\\nrities on the primary market, because investors are constantly deciding between existing \\ninvestments and proposed new investments.\\nWe have seen that it would be a mistake to think that a financial manager takes no \\ninterest in the secondary market for the securities issued by his company. On the contrary, \\nit is on the secondary market that his company’s financial “raw material” is priced every \\nday. When the raw material is equities, there is another reason the company cannot afford \\nto turn its back on the secondary market: this is where investors trade the voting rights in \\nthe company’s affairs and, by extension, control of the company.\\n3/ DERIVATIVE MARKETS : FUTURES AND OPTIONS\\nDerivative markets are where securities that derive their value from another asset (share, \\nbond, commodity or even climate index) are traded. There are two main types of deriva-\\ntive products: options (which we will develop in Chapter 23 as they have become a key \\nmatter in financial theory and practice) and futures (Chapter 50).\\nDerivatives are instruments for taking positions on other instruments, or “contracts on \\ncontracts” . They let you take signiﬁcant short or long positions on other assets with a \\nlimited outlay of funds.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='Chapter 1 WHAT IS CORPORATE FINANCE ? 9\\nDerivative instruments are tailored especially to the management of financial risk. By \\nusing derivatives, the financial manager chooses a price – expressed as an interest rate, \\nan exchange rate or the price of a raw material – that is independent of the company’s \\nfinancing or investment term. Derivatives are also highly liquid. The financial manager \\ncan change his mind at any time at a minimal cost.\\nOptions and futures allow one to take important risks with a reduced initial outlay \\ndue to their leverage effect (this is called speculation), or on the contrary to transfer risks \\nto a third party (hedging).\\nSection 1.4\\nMOST IMPORTANTLY , HE IS A NEGOTIATOR  . . .\\nLet’s return to our financial manager who has just created a financial security. Because the \\nsecurity is traded on a secondary market, he doesn’t know who holds the securities. Nor \\ndoes he know who has sold it, especially as, via the futures market, investors can sell the \\nsecurity without ever having bought it.\\nBut what exactly is our financial manager selling? Or, put another way: how can the \\nvalue of the financial security be determined?\\nFrom a practical standpoint, the financial manager “sells” management’s reputation \\nfor integrity, its expertise, the quality of the company’s assets, its overall financial health, \\nits ability to generate a certain level of profitability over a given period and its commit-\\nment to more or less restrictive legal terms. Note that the quality of assets will be par-\\nticularly important in the case of a loan tied to and often secured by specific assets, while \\noverall financial health will dominate when financing is not tied to specific assets.\\nTheoretically, the financial manager sells expected future cash flows that can derive \\nonly from the company’s business operations.\\nA company cannot distribute more cash flow to its providers of funds than its busi-\\nness generates. A money-losing company pays its creditors only at the expense of its \\nshareholders. When a company with sub-par profitability pays a dividend, it jeopardises \\nits financial health.\\nThe financial manager’s role is to transform the company’s commercial and indus-\\ntrial business assets and commitments into financial assets and commitments.\\nIn so doing, he spreads the expected cash flows among many different investor \\ngroups: banks, financial investors, family shareholders, individual investors, etc.\\nFinancial investors then turn these flows into negotiable instruments traded on an \\nopen market, which value the instruments in relation to other opportunities available on \\nthe market.\\nUnderlying the securities is the market’s evaluation of the company. A company \\nconsidered to be poorly managed will see investors vote with their feet. Yields on the \\ncompany’s securities will rise to prohibitive levels and prices on them will fall. Financial \\ndifficulties, if not already present, will soon follow. The financial manager must therefore \\nkeep the market convinced at all times of the quality of his company, because that is what \\nbacks up the securities it issues!\\nThe different financial partners hold a portion of the value of the company. This \\ndiversity gives rise to yet another job for the financial manager: he must adroitly steer \\nthe company through the distribution of the overall value of the company.'),\n",

WHO NEVER FORGETS TO DO AN OCCASIONAL REALITY CHECK !\\nThe financial investors who buy the company’s securities do so not out of altruism, but \\nbecause they hope to realise a certain rate of return on their investment, in the form of \\ninterest, dividends or capital gains. In other words, in return for entrusting the company \\nwith their money via their purchase of the company’s securities, they require a minimum \\nreturn on their investment.\\nConsequently, the financial manager must make sure that over the medium term the \\ncompany makes investments with returns at least equal to the rate of return expected by the \\ncompany’s providers of capital. If so, all is well. If not, if the company is consistently fall-\\ning short of this goal, it will destroy value, turning what was worth 100 into 90, or 80. This \\nis corporate purgatory. On the other hand, if the profitability of its investments consistently \\nexceeds investor demands, transforming 100 into 120 or more, the company deserves the \\nkudos it will get. But it should also remain humble. With technological progress and dereg-\\nulation advancing apace, repeat performances are becoming more and more challenging.\\nThe financial manager must therefore analyse proposed investment projects and \\nexplain to his colleagues that some should not be undertaken because they are not prof-\\nitable enough. In short, he sometimes has to be a “party-pooper”. He is indirectly the \\nspokesman of the financial investment community.\\nThe financial manager must ensure that the company creates value, that the assets it \\nhas assembled will generate a rate of return into the medium term that is at least equal to \\nthe rate required by the investors whose capital has enabled the company to build those \\nassets.\\nIf not, he should discuss how to improve the situation with operational people. Some-\\ntimes he will become a strategist and suggest to the top management of his company that it \\nshould review its perimeter. Underperforming units where the company has been struggling \\nto get a return commensurate with their risks should be sold to free up resources allowing \\nit to expand, organically or through acquisitions, the most promising or efficient divisions.\\nSection 1.6\\n. . . HE IS ALSO NOW A RISK MANAGER\\nFluctuations in interest rates, currencies and the prices of raw materials are so great that \\nfinancial risks are as important as industrial risks. Consider a Swiss company that buys \\ncopper in the world market, then processes it and sells it in Switzerland and abroad.\\nIts performance depends not only on the price of copper but also on the exchange rate \\nof the US dollar vs. the Swiss franc, because it uses the dollar to make purchases abroad \\nand receives payment in dollars for international sales. Lastly, interest rate fluctuations \\nhave an impact on the company’s financial flows. A multi-headed dragon!'),\n",

As the bumper sticker says, “If you \\nthink education is expensive, try ignorance!”\\nTake an example of an economy with no derivative markets. A corporate treasurer \\nanticipating a decline in long-term interest rates and whose company has long-term debt \\nhas no choice but to borrow short term, invest the proceeds long term, wait for interest \\nrates to decline, pay off the short-term loans and borrow again. You will have no trouble \\nunderstanding that this strategy has its limits. The balance sheet becomes inflated, inter-\\nmediation costs rise, and so on. Derivative markets enable the treasurer to manage this \\nlong-term interest rate risk without touching his company’s balance sheet.\\nGenerally, the CFO is responsible for the identification, the assessment and the man-\\nagement of risks for the firm. This includes not only currency and interest rate risks but \\nalso liquidity and counterparty risk. Recent years have shown that a CFO with strong \\nknow-how in such matters is highly appreciated.\\nWe are far from the CFOs of the sixties who were mainly top-of-the-class accoun-\\ntants! Nowadays they are required not only to perfectly master accounting and finance, \\nbut also to be gifted in marketing and negotiation, not to mention tax and legal issues \\nand risk management. The best of them also have a strategic way of thinking, and their \\nintimate knowledge of the company and its human resources allows them to be serious \\ncandidates for the top job. As an illustration, the current CEOs of Siemens, WPP, RTL, \\nand Michelin are all former CFOs of their companies.\\nHow’s that appetite?\\nWe’re going to leave you with these appetisers in the hope that you are now hungry \\nfor more. But beware of taking the principles briefly presented here and skipping directly \\nto Section III of the book. If you are looking for high finance and get-rich-quick schemes, \\nthis book is definitely not for you. The menu we propose is as follows:\\ntFirst, an understanding of the firm, i.e. the source of all the cash flows that are the \\nsubject of our analysis (Section I: Financial analysis).\\nt Then an appreciation of markets, because it is they who are constantly valuing the \\nfirm (Section II: Investors and markets).\\nt Then an understanding of how value is created and how it is measured (Section III: Value).\\nt Followed by the major financial decisions of the firm, viewed in the light of both \\nmarket theory and organisational theory (Section IV: Corporate financial policies).\\nt Finally, if you persevere through the foregoing, you will get to taste the dessert, \\nasSection V: Financial Management presents several practical, current topics in \\nfinancial management.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com. \\nThe ﬁnancial manager has three main roles:\\ntTo ensure the company has enough funds to ﬁnance its expansion and meet its obliga-\\ntions. To do this, the company issues securities (equity and debt) and the ﬁnancial \\nmanager sells them to ﬁnancial investors at the highest possible price. In today’s \\ncapital market economy, the role of the ﬁnancial manager is less a buyer of funds, with \\nan objective to minimise cost, and more a seller of ﬁnancial securities. By emphasis-\\ning the ﬁnancial security, we focus on its value, which combines the notions of return \\nand risk. We thereby de-emphasise the importance of minimising the cost of ﬁnancial \\nSUMMARY'),\n",

Casting the ﬁnancial man-\\nager in the role of salesman also underlines the marketing aspect of his job, which is \\nfar from theoretical. He has customers (investors) that he must convince to buy the \\nsecurities his company issues. The better he understands their needs, the more suc-\\ncessful he will be.\\nt To ensure that over the long run the company uses the resources investors put at its \\ndisposal to generate a rate of return at least equal to the rate of return the investors \\nrequire. If it does, the company creates value. If it does not, it destroys value. If it \\ncontinues to destroy value, investors will turn their backs on the company and the value \\nof its securities will decline. Ultimately, the company will have to change its senior \\nmanagers, or face bankruptcy.\\nt To identify and manage the ﬁnancial risks the company is facing.\\nIn his ﬁrst role, the ﬁnancial manager transforms the company’s real assets into ﬁnancial \\nassets. He must maximise the value of these ﬁnancial assets while selling them to the various \\ncategories of investors.\\nHis second role is a thankless one.

Likewise, we need to start our study of corporate finance by analysing \\ncompany cash flows.\\nSection 2.1\\nCLASSIFYING COMPANY CASH FLOWS\\nLet’s consider, for example, the monthly account statement that individual customers \\nreceive from their bank. It is presented as a series of lines showing the various inflows and \\noutflows of money on precise dates and in some cases the type of transaction (deposit of \\ncheques, for instance).\\nOur first step is to trace the rationale for each of the entries on the statement, which \\ncould be everyday purchases, payment of a salary, automatic transfers, loan repayments \\nor the receipt of bond coupons, to mention a few examples.\\nThe corresponding task for a financial manager is to reclassify company cash flows \\nby category to draw up a cash flow document that can be used to:\\ntanalyse past trends in cash flow (the document put together is generally known as a \\ncash flow statement1); or\\nt project future trends in cash flow, over a shorter or longer period (the document \\nneeded is a cash flow budget or plan).\\nWith this goal in mind, we will now demonstrate that cash flows can be classified into one \\nof the following processes:\\ntActivities that form part of the industrial and commercial life of a company:\\n○ operating cycle;\\n○ investment cycle.\\nt Financing activities to fund these cycles:\\n○ the debt cycle;\\n○ the equity cycle.\\n1 Or sometimes as a \\nstatement of changes \\nin\\xa0financial position.'),\n",

What does he \\nfind? Firstly, he sees how much he spent in cash at the wholesale market in the morning \\nand then the cash proceeds from fruit and vegetable sales during the day. If we assume \\nthat the greengrocer sold all the produce he bought in the morning at a mark-up, the bal-\\nance of receipts and payments for the day will be a cash surplus.\\nUnfortunately, things are usually more complicated in practice. It’s rare that all the \\ngoods bought in the morning are sold by the evening, especially in the case of a manu-\\nfacturing business.\\nA company processes raw materials as part of an operating cycle, the length of which \\nvaries tremendously, from a day in the newspaper sector to seven years in the cognac \\nsector. There is, then, a time lag between purchases of raw materials and the sale of the \\ncorresponding finished goods.\\nThis time lag is not the only complicating factor. It is unusual for companies to buy \\nand sell in cash. Usually, their suppliers grant them extended payment periods, and they \\nin turn grant their customers extended payment periods. The money received during the \\nday does not necessarily come from sales made on the same day.\\nAs a result of customer credit 2, supplier credit 3 and the time it takes to manufac-\\nture and sell products or services, the operating cycle of each and every company spans \\na certain period, leading to timing differences between operating outflows and the \\ncorresponding operating inflows.\\nEach business has its own operating cycle of a certain length that, from a cash flow \\nstandpoint, may lead to positive or negative cash flows at different times. Operating out-\\nflows and inflows from different cycles are analysed by period, e.g. by month or by year. \\nThe balance of these flows is called operating cash flow. Operating cash flow reflects the \\ncash flows generated by operations during a given period.\\nIn concrete terms, operating cash flow represents the cash flow generated by the com-\\npany’s day-to-day operations. Returning to our initial example of an individual looking \\nat his bank statement, it represents the difference between the receipts and normal outgo-\\nings, such as food, electricity and car maintenance costs.\\nNaturally, unless there is a major timing difference caused by some unusual circum-\\nstances (start-up period of a business, very strong growth, very strong seasonal fluctua-\\ntions), the balance of operating receipts and payments should be positive.\\nReaders with accounting knowledge will note that operating cash flow is independent \\nof any accounting policies, which makes sense since it relates only to cash flows. More \\nspecifically:\\ntneither the company’s depreciation and provisioning policy, \\nt nor its inventory valuation method,\\nt nor the techniques used to defer costs over several periods have any impact on the \\nfigure.\\nHowever, the concept is affected by decisions about how to classify payments between \\ninvestment and operating outlays, as we will now examine more closely.\\n2 That is credit \\ngranted by the \\ncompany to \\nits customers, \\nallowing them \\nto pay the bill \\nseveral days, \\nweeks or, in some \\ncountries, even \\nseveral months \\nafter receiving \\nthe invoice.\\n3That is credit \\ngranted by \\nsuppliers to the \\ncompany.'),\n",

The greengrocer may, for instance, \\nbegin receiving deliveries once a week only and will therefore have to run much larger \\ninventories. Admittedly, the impact of the longer operating cycle due to much larger \\ninventories may be offset by larger credit from his suppliers. The key point here is to \\nrecognise that the operating cycle will change.\\nThe operating cycle is different for each business and, generally speaking, the more \\nsophisticated the end product, the longer the operating cycle.\\nBut most importantly, before he can start up this new activity, our greengrocer needs \\nto invest in a chest freezer.\\nWhat difference is there, from solely a cash flow standpoint, between this investment \\nand operating outlays?\\nThe outlay on the chest freezer seems to be a prerequisite. It forms the basis for a \\nnew activity, the success of which is unknown. It appears to carry higher risks and will \\nbe beneficial only if overall operating cash flow generated by the greengrocer increases. \\nLastly, investments are carried out from a long-term perspective and have a longer \\nlife than that of the operating cycle. Indeed, they last for several operating cycles, even \\nif they do not last forever given the fast pace of technological progress.\\nThis justifies the distinction, from a cash flow perspective, between operating and \\ninvestment outflows.\\nNormal outflows, from an individual’s perspective, differ from an investment out-\\nflow in that they afford enjoyment, whereas investment represents abstinence. As we will \\nsee, this type of decision represents one of the vital underpinnings of finance. Only the \\nvery puritanically minded would take more pleasure from buying a microwave than from \\nspending the same amount of money at a restaurant! Only one of these choices can be \\nan investment and the other an ordinary outflow. So what purpose do investments serve? \\nInvestment is worthwhile only if the decision to forego normal spending, which gives \\ninstant pleasure, will subsequently lead to greater gratification.\\nFrom a cash ﬂow standpoint, an investment is an outlay that is subsequently expected to \\nincrease operating cash ﬂow such that overall the individual will be happy to have forsaken \\ninstant gratiﬁcation.\\nThis is the definition of the return on investment (be it industrial or financial) from a \\ncash flow standpoint. We will use this definition throughout this book.\\nLike the operating cycle, the investment cycle is characterised by a series of inflows \\nand outflows. But the length of the investment cycle is far longer than the length of the \\noperating cycle.\\nThe purpose of investment outlays (also frequently called capital expenditures) is to alter \\nthe operating cycle, e.g. to boost or enhance the cash ﬂows that it generates.\\nThe impact of investment outlays is spread over several operating cycles.

The proceeds would also be part of the investment cycle.\\n3/ FREE CASH FLOW\\nBefore-tax free cash flow is defined as the difference between operating cash flow and \\ncapital expenditure net of fixed asset disposals.\\nAs we shall see in Sections II and III of this book, free cash flow can be calculated \\nbefore or after tax. It also forms the basis for the most important valuation technique. \\nOperating cash flow is a concept that depends on how expenditure is classified between \\noperating and investment outlays. Since this distinction is not always clear-cut, operating \\ncash flow is not widely used in practice, with free cash flow being far more popular. If free \\ncash flow turns negative, additional financial resources will have to be raised to cover the \\ncompany’s cash flow requirements.\\nSection 2.3\\nFINANCIAL RESOURCES\\nThe operating and investment cycles give rise to a timing difference in cash flows. \\nEmployees and suppliers have to be paid before customers settle up. Likewise, invest-\\nments have to be completed before they generate any receipts. Naturally, this cash flow \\ndeficit needs to be filled. This is the role of financial resources.\\nThe purpose of financial resources is simple: they must cover the shortfalls resulting \\nfrom these timing differences by providing the company with sufficient funds to balance \\nits cash flow.\\nThese financial resources are provided by investors: shareholders, debtholders, \\nlenders, etc. These financial resources are not provided “no strings attached”. In return for \\nproviding the funds, investors expect to be subsequently rewarded by receiving dividends \\nor interest payments, registering capital gains, etc. This can happen only if the operating \\nand investment cycles generate positive cash flows.\\nTo the extent that the financial investors have made the investment and operating \\nactivities possible, they expect to receive, in various different forms, their fair share of the \\nsurplus cash flows generated by these cycles.\\nThe ﬁnancing cycle is therefore the “ﬂip side” of the investment and operating cycles.\\nAt its most basic, the principle would be to finance these shortfalls solely using capital \\nthat incurs the risk of the business. Such capital is known as shareholders’ equity. This \\ntype of financial resource forms the cornerstone of the entire financial system. Its impor-\\ntance is such that shareholders providing it are granted decision-making powers and con-\\ntrol over the business in various different ways. From a cash flow standpoint, the equity \\ncycle comprises inflows from capital increases and outflows in the form of dividend pay-\\nments to the shareholders.\\nLike individuals, a business may decide to ask lenders rather than shareholders to \\nhelp it cover a cash flow shortage. Bankers will lend funds only after they have carefully '),\n",

They want to be nearly certain of being repaid \\nand do not want exposure to the company’s business risk. These cash flow shortages may \\nbe short term or long term, but lenders do not want to take on business risk. The capital \\nthey provide represents the company’s debt capital.\\nThe debt cycle is the following: the business arranges borrowings in return for a com-\\nmitment to repay the capital and make interest payments regardless of trends in its operat-\\ning and investment cycles. These undertakings represent firm commitments, ensuring that \\nthe lender is certain of recovering its funds provided that the commitments are met. This \\ndefinition applies to both:\\ntfinancing for the investment cycle, with the increase in future net receipts set to cover \\ncapital repayments and interest payments on borrowings; and\\nt financing for the operating cycle, with credit making it possible to bring forward \\ncertain inflows or to defer certain outflows.\\nFrom a cash flow standpoint, the life of a business comprises an operating and an invest-\\nment cycle, leading to a positive or negative free cash flow. If free cash flow is negative, \\nthe financing cycle covers the funding shortfall. But free cash flow cannot be forever \\nnegative: sooner or later investors must get a return and/or get repaid.\\nAs the future is unknown, a distinction has to be drawn between:\\ntequity, where the only commitment is to enable the shareholders to beneﬁt fully \\nfrom the success of the venture;\\nt debt capital, where the only commitment is to meet the capital repayments and \\ninterest payments regardless of the success or failure of the venture.\\nThe risk incurred by the lender is that this commitment will not be met. Theoretically \\nspeaking, debt may be regarded as an advance on future cash flows generated by the \\ninvestments made and guaranteed by the company’s shareholders’ equity.\\nAlthough a business needs to raise funds to finance investments, it may also find, \\nat a given point in time, that it has a cash surplus, i.e. the funds available exceed cash \\nrequirements.\\nThese surplus funds are then invested in short-term investments and marketable \\nsecurities that generate revenue, called ﬁnancial income.\\nThese investments are generally realised with a view to ensuring the possibility of a \\nvery quick exit without any risk of losses.\\nAlthough at first sight short-term financial investments (marketable securities) may \\nbe regarded as investments since they generate a rate of return, we advise readers to con-\\nsider them instead as the opposite of debt. As we will see, company treasurers often have \\nto raise additional debt even if at the same time the company holds short-term investments \\nwithout speculating in any way.\\nDebt and short-term financial investments or marketable securities should not be con-\\nsidered independently of each other, but as inextricably linked. We suggest that readers\\nreason in terms of debt net of short-term financial investments and financial expense \\nnet of financial income.\\nPutting all the individual pieces together, we arrive at the following simplified cash \\nflow statement, with the balance reflecting the net decrease in the company’s debt during \\na given period:'),\n",

In this chapter, we are going to study the income statement to \\nshow how the various cycles of a company create wealth.\\nSection 3.1\\nADDITIONS TO WEALTH AND DEDUCTIONS FROM WEALTH\\nWhat would your spontaneous answer be to the following questions?\\ntDoes purchasing an apartment make you richer or poorer?\\nt Would your answer change if you were to buy the apartment on credit?\\nThere can be no doubt as to the correct answer. Provided that you pay the market price \\nfor the apartment, your wealth is not affected whether or not you buy it on credit. Our \\nexperience as teachers has shown us that students often confuse cash and wealth.\\nCash and wealth are two of the fundamental concepts of corporate ﬁnance. It is vital \\nto be able to juggle them around and thus be able to differentiate between them \\nconﬁdently.\\nConsequently, we advise readers to train their minds by analysing the impact of all trans-\\nactions in terms of cash flows and wealth impacts.\\nFor instance, when you buy an apartment, you become neither richer nor poorer, but \\nyour cash decreases. Arranging a loan makes you no richer or poorer than you were before \\n(you owe the money), but your cash has increased. If a fire destroys your house and it was \\nnot insured, you are worse off, but your cash position has not changed, since you have not \\nspent any money.\\nRaising debt is tantamount to increasing your financial resources and commitments \\nat the same time. As a result, it has no impact on your net worth. Buying an apartment for \\ncash results in a change in your assets (reduction in cash, increase in real estate assets), \\nwithout any change in net worth. The possible examples are endless. Spending money \\ndoes not necessarily make you poorer. Likewise, receiving money does not necessarily\\nmake you richer.'),\n",

The funda-\\nmental aim of all businesses is to increase wealth. Additions to wealth cannot be achieved \\nwithout some deductions from wealth. In sum, earnings represent the difference between \\nadditions to and deductions from wealth.\\n1 Also called a \\nProfit and Loss \\nstatement or \\nP&L account.\\nRevenues Gross additions to wealth\\n− Costs − gross deductions from wealth\\n= Earnings = net additions to wealth (deductions from)\\nEarnings represent the difference between revenues and costs, leading to a change \\nin net worth during a given period. Earnings are positive when wealth is created and \\nnegative when wealth is destroyed.\\nSince the rationale behind the income statement is not the same as for a cash flow state-\\nment, some cash flows do not appear on the income statement (those that neither generate \\nnor destroy wealth). Likewise, some revenues and costs are not shown on the cash flow \\nstatement (because they have no impact on the company’s cash position).\\n1/ EARNINGS AND THE OPERATING CYCLE\\nThe operating cycle forms the basis of the company’s wealth. It consists of both:\\ntadditions to wealth (products and services sold, i.e. products and services whose \\nworth is recognised in the market); and\\nt deductions from wealth (consumption of raw materials or goods for resale, use of \\nlabour, use of external services such as transportation, taxes and other duties).\\nThe very essence of a business is to increase wealth by means of its operating cycle.\\nAdditions to wealth Operating revenues\\nDeductions from wealth− Cash operating costs\\n= Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \\namortisation (EBITDA)\\nPut another way, the result of the operating cycle is the balance of operating rev-\\nenues and cash operating costs incurred to obtain these revenues. We will refer to it \\nas gross operating proﬁt or EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \\namortisation).\\nIt may be described as gross insofar as it covers just the operating cycle and is calcu-\\nlated before non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortisation, and before interest \\nand taxes.'),\n",

In a wealth-oriented \\napproach, an investment represents a use of funds that retains some value.\\nTo invest is to forego liquid funds: an asset is purchased but no wealth is destroyed. As \\na result, investments never appear directly on the income statement.\\nThat said, the value of investments may change during a financial year:\\ntit may decrease if they suffer wear and tear or become obsolete;\\nt it may increase if the market value of certain assets rises. Most of the time, by virtue \\nof the principle of prudence, increases in value are recorded only if realised through \\nthe disposal of the asset.2\\n(b) Accounting for a decrease in the value of ﬁxed assets\\nThe decrease in value of a fixed asset due to its use by the company is accounted for by \\nmeans of depreciation and amortisation.3\\nImpairment losses or write-downs on fixed assets  recognise the loss in value of \\nan asset not related to its day-to-day use, i.e. the unforeseen diminution in the value of:\\ntan intangible asset (goodwill, patents, etc.);\\nt a tangible asset (property, plant and equipment);\\nt an investment in a subsidiary.\\nDepreciation and amortisation on ﬁxed assets are so-called “non-cash” costs insofar as \\nthey merely reﬂect arbitrary accounting assessments of the loss in value.\\n(which are included in operating costs) and provisions.\\n3/ THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OPERATING COSTS AND FIXED ASSETS\\nAlthough we are easily able to define investment from a cash flow perspective, we rec-\\nognise that our approach goes against the grain of the traditional presentation of these \\nmatters, especially as far as those familiar with accounting are concerned:\\ntWhatever is consumed as part of the operating cycle to create something new belongs \\nto the operating cycle. Without wishing to philosophise, we note that the act of cre-\\nation always entails some form of destruction.\\nt Whatever is used without being destroyed directly, thus retaining its value, belongs \\nto the investment cycle. This represents an immutable asset or, in accounting terms, \\na fixed asset (a “non-current asset” in IFRS terminology).\\nFor instance, to make bread, a baker uses flour, salt and water, all of which form part \\nof the end product. The process also entails labour, which has a value only insofar as it \\ntransforms the raw material into the end product. At the same time, the baker also needs a \\n2 But IFRS have \\ncreated some \\nexceptions to this \\nprinciple that we \\nwill see in Chap-\\nters 6 and 7.\\n3Amortisation\\nis sometimes \\nused instead of \\ndepreciation, \\nparticularly in \\nthe context of \\nintangible assets.'),\n",

Though this oven may experience wear and tear, it will be used many times over.\\nThis is the major distinction that can be drawn between operating costs and fixed \\nassets. It may look deceptively straightforward, but in practice is no clearer than the dis-\\ntinction between investment and operating outlays. For instance, does an advertising cam-\\npaign represent a charge linked solely to one period with no impact on any other? Or does \\nit represent the creation of an asset (e.g. a brand)?\\n4/ THE COMPANY ’S OPERATING PROFIT\\nFrom EBITDA, which is linked to the operating cycle, we deduct non-cash costs, which \\ncomprise depreciation and amortisation and impairment losses or write-downs on fixed \\nassets.\\nThis gives us operating income or operating profit or EBIT (earnings before interest \\nand taxes), which reflects the increase in wealth generated by the company’s industrial \\nand commercial activities.\\nOperating proﬁt or EBIT represents the earnings generated by investment and operating \\ncycles for a given period.\\nThe term “operating” contrasts with the term “financial”, reflecting the distinction \\nbetween the real world and the realms of finance. Indeed, operating income is the product \\nof the company’s industrial and commercial activities before its financing operations are \\ntaken into account. Operating profit or EBIT may also be called operating income, trading \\nprofit or operating result.\\n5/ EARNINGS AND THE FINANCING CYCLE\\n(a) Debt capital\\nRepayments of borrowings do not constitute costs but, as their name suggests, merely \\nrepayments.\\nJust as common sense tells us that securing a loan does not increase wealth, neither \\ndoes repaying a borrowing represent a charge.\\nThe income statement shows only costs related to borrowings. It never shows the \\nrepayments of borrowings, which are deducted from the debt recorded on the balance \\nsheet.\\nWe emphasise this point because our experience tells us that many mistakes are made in \\nthis area.\\nConversely, we should note that the interest payments made on borrowings lead to a \\ndecrease in the wealth of the company and thus represent an expense for the company. As \\na result, they are shown on the income statement.\\nThe difference between financial income and financial expense is called net financial \\nexpense/(income).'),\n",

These cash inflows give rise \\nto ownership rights over the company. The income statement measures the creation of \\nwealth by the company; it therefore naturally ends with the net earnings (also called net \\nprofit). Whether the net earnings are paid in dividends or not is a simple choice of cash \\nposition made by the shareholder.\\nIf we take a step back, we see that net earnings and financial interest are based on \\nthe same principle of distributing the wealth created by the company. Likewise, income \\ntax represents earnings paid to the State in spite of the fact that it does not contribute any \\nfunds to the company.\\n6/ RECURRENT AND NON -RECURRENT ITEMS : EXTRAORDINARY AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS ,\\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\\nWe have now considered all the operations of a business that may be allocated to the oper-\\nating, investing and financing cycles of a company. That said, it is not hard to imagine the \\ndifficulties involved in classifying the financial consequences of certain extraordinary\\nevents, such as losses incurred as a result of earthquakes, other natural disasters or the \\nexpropriation of assets by a government.\\nThey are not expected to occur frequently or regularly and are beyond the control of \\na company’s management – hence, the idea of creating a separate catch-all category for \\nprecisely such extraordinary items.\\nWe will see in Chapter 9 that the distinction between non-recurring and recurring \\nitems is not an easy one, all the more so as accounting regulatory bodies do little to help us.\\nAmong the many different types of exceptional events, we will briefly focus on asset \\ndisposals. Investing forms an integral part of the industrial and commercial activities of \\nbusinesses. But it would be foolhardy to believe that investment is a one-way process. \\nThe best-laid plans may fail, while others may lead down a strategic impasse.\\nPut another way, disinvesting is also a key part of an entrepreneur’s activities. It gen-\\nerates exceptional “asset disposal” inflows on the cash flow statement and capital gains \\nand losses on the income statement, which may appear under exceptional items.\\nBy definition, it is easier to analyse and forecast profit before tax and non-recurrent \\nitems than net income or net profit, which is calculated after the impact of non-recurrent \\nitems and tax.\\n7/ NET INCOME\\nNet income measures the creation or destruction of wealth during the fiscal year. Net \\nincome is a wealth indicator, not a cash indicator. It incorporates wealth-destructive \\n4 Or non-recur-\\nrent items.'),\n",

This shows the cost of goods sold, selling and marketing costs, \\nresearch and development costs and general and administrative costs; or\\nt by nature,6 i.e. by type of expenditure or revenue which shows the change in inven-\\ntories of finished goods and in work in progress (closing minus opening inven tory), \\npurchases of and changes in inventories of goods for resale and raw materials (clos-\\ning minus opening inventory), other external costs, personnel expenses, taxes and \\nother duties, depreciation and amortisation.\\nThankfully, operating proﬁt works out to be the same, irrespective of the format \\nused!\\nThe by-nature presentation predominates to a great extent in Italy, India, Spain and \\nBelgium. In the US, the by-function presentation is used almost to the exclusion of any \\nother form.7\\nWhereas in the past, France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK tended to use sys-\\ntematically the by-nature or by-function format, the current situation is less clear-cut. \\nMoreover, a new presentation is making some headway; it is mainly a by-function for-\\nmat but depreciation and amortisation are not included in the cost of goods sold, in \\nselling and marketing costs, or research and development costs, but is isolated on a \\nseparate line.\\nThe two different income statement formats can be summarised by the following \\ndiagram:\\n5 Also called \\nby-destination\\nincome\\nstatement.\\n6Also called by-\\ncategory income \\nstatement.\\n7 The US airline \\ncompanies are an \\nexception as most \\nof them use the \\nby-nature income \\nstatement.\\nPresentation\\nBrazil\\nChina\\nFrance\\nGermany\\nIndia\\nItaly\\nJapan\\nMorocco\\nRussia\\nSwitzerland\\nUK\\nUS\\nBy nature 7% 29% 23% 23% 100% 70% 0% 100% 52% 40% 40% 0%\\nBy function 77% 71% 70% 73% 0% 30% 77% 0% 33% 60% 50% 70%\\nOther 16% 0% 7% 4% 0% 0% 23% 0% 15% 0% 10% 30%\\nSource: 2013 annual reports from the top 30 listed non-ﬁnancial groups in each country'),\n",

This format clearly shows that oper-\\nating profit is the difference between sales and the cost of sales irrespective of their nature \\n(i.e. production, sales, research and development, administration).\\nOn the other hand, it does not differentiate between the operating and investment pro-\\ncesses since depreciation and amortisation is not shown directly on the income statement \\n(it is split up between the four main corporate functions), obliging analysts to track down \\nthe information in the cash flow statement or in the notes to the accounts.\\n2/ THE BY -NATURE INCOME STATEMENT FORMAT\\nThis is the traditional presentation of income statements in many continental European \\ncountries, although some groups are dropping it in favour of the by-function format in \\ntheir consolidated accounts.\\nThe by-nature format is simple to apply, even for small companies, because no allo-\\ncation of expenses is required. It offers a more detailed breakdown of costs.\\nNaturally, as in the previous approach, operating profit is still the difference between \\nsales and the cost of sales.\\nIn this format, costs are recognised as they are incurred rather than when the cor-\\nresponding items are used. Showing on the income statement all purchases made and all \\ninvoices sent to customers during the same period would not be comparing like with like.\\nA business may transfer to inventory some of the purchases made during a given \\nyear. The transfer of these purchases to inventory does not destroy any wealth. Instead, \\nit represents the formation of an asset, albeit probably a temporary one, but one that has \\nreal value at a given point in time. Secondly, some of the end products produced by the \\ncompany may not be sold during the year and yet the corresponding costs appear on the \\nincome statement.\\nTo compare like with like, it is necessary to:\\nt eliminate changes in inventories of raw materials and goods for resale from purchases \\nto get raw materials and goods for resale that were used rather than simply purchased;\\nt add changes in the inventory of finished products and work in progress back to sales. \\nAs a result, the income statement shows production rather than just sales.\\nThe by-nature format shows the amount spent on production for the period and not the \\ntotal expenses under the accruals convention. It has the logical disadvantage that it seems \\nto imply that changes in inventory are a revenue or an expense in their own right, which \\nthey are not. They are only an adjustment to purchases to obtain relevant costs.\\nExercise 1 will help readers get to grips with the concept of changes in inventories of \\nfinished goods and work in progress.\\nTo sum up, there are two different income statement formats:'),\n",

This amount then needs to be adjusted (for \\nchanges in inventories) so that it may be compared with products sold during the \\nperiod;\\nt the by-function format which is built directly in terms of the cost price of goods or \\nservices sold.\\nEither way, it is worth noting that EBITDA depends heavily on the inventory valuation \\nmethods used by the business. This emphasises the appeal of the by-nature format, which \\nshows inventory changes on a separate line of the income statement and thus clearly indi-\\ncates their order of magnitude.\\nLike operating cash flow, EBITDA is not influenced by the valuation methods applied \\nto tangible and intangible fixed assets or the taxation system.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nA distinction needs to be made between cash and wealth. Spending money does not neces-\\nsarily make you poorer and neither does receiving money necessarily make you any richer. \\nAdditions to wealth or deductions from wealth by a company are measured on the income \\nstatement. They are the difference between revenues and costs that increase a company’s \\nnet worth during a given period.\\nFrom an accounting standpoint, operating costs reﬂect what is used up immediately in the \\noperating cycle and somehow forms part of the end product. On the contrary, ﬁxed assets are \\nnot destroyed directly during the production process and retain some of their value.\\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) shows the proﬁt \\ngenerated by the operating cycle (operating revenues − operating costs).\\nAs part of the operating cycle, a business naturally builds up inventories, which are assets. \\nThese represent deferred costs, the impact of which needs to be eliminated in the calcula-\\ntion of EBITDA. In the by-nature format, this adjustment is made to operating revenues (by \\nadding back changes in ﬁnished goods inventories) and to operating costs (by subtracting \\nchanges in inventories of raw materials and goods for resale from purchases). The by-function \\nincome statement shows merely sales and the cost of goods sold requiring no adjustment.\\nCapital expenditures never appear directly on the income statement, but they lead to an \\nincrease in the amount of ﬁxed assets held. That said, an accounting assessment of impair-\\nment in the value of these investments leads to non-cash expenses, which are shown on the \\nincome statement (depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on ﬁxed assets).\\nEBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) shows the proﬁt generated by the operating and \\ninvestment cycles. In concrete terms, it represents the proﬁt generated by the industrial and \\ncommercial activities of a business. It is allocated to:\\ntﬁnancial expense: only costs related to borrowings appear on the income statement, \\nsince capital repayments do not represent a destruction of wealth;\\nt corporate income tax;\\nt net income that is distributed to shareholders as dividends or transferred to the reserves \\n(as retained earnings).\\nSUMMARY\\n\\xa0SUMMA'),\n",

For instance, at any moment, \\nshareholders’ equity is equal to the sum of capital increases by shareholders and \\nannual net income for past years not distributed in the form of dividends plus the \\noriginal share capital.\\nSection 4.1\\nTHE BALANCE SHEET : DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\\nThe purpose of a balance sheet is to list all the assets of a business and all of its financial \\nresources at a given point in time.\\n1/ MAIN ITEMS ON A BALANCE SHEET\\nAssets on the balance sheet comprise:\\nt fixed assets,1 i.e. everything required for the operating cycle that is not destroyed \\nas part of it.

If it is capitalised, it will appear on the asset side of the balance \\nsheet, and if expensed, it will lead to a reduction in earnings and thus shareholders’ equity. \\nThe double-entry for this purchase is either a reduction in cash (i.e. a decrease in an asset) \\nor a commitment (i.e. a liability) to the vendor (i.e. an increase in a liability). According \\nto the algebra of accounting, assets and resources (equity and liabilities) always carry the \\nopposite sign, so the equilibrium of the balance sheet is always maintained.\\nIt is European practice to classify assets starting with fixed assets and to end with \\ncash,4 whereas it is North American and Japanese practice to start with cash. The same \\nis true for the equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet: Europeans start with equity, \\nwhereas North Americans and Japanese end with it.\\nA “horizontal” format is common in continental Europe, with assets on the left and \\nresources on the right.

Non-\\noperating assets can thus be excluded from the company’s capital employed. By isolating \\nnon-operating assets, we can assess the resources the company may be able to call upon \\nin hard times (i.e. through the disposal of non-operating assets).\\nThe difference between operating and non-operating assets can be subtle in certain \\ncircumstances. For instance, how should a company’s head office on Bond Street or on the \\nChamps-Elysées be classified? Probably under operating assets for a fashion house or a \\ncar manufacturer, but under non-operating assets for an engineering or construction group \\nwhich has no business reason to be on Bond Street (unlike Burberry).\\n2/ WORKING CAPITAL\\nUses of funds comprise all the operating costs incurred but not yet used or sold (i.e. inven-\\ntories) and all sales that have not yet been paid for (trade receivables).\\nSources of funds comprise all charges incurred but not yet paid for (trade payables, \\nsocial security and tax payables), as well as operating revenues from products that have \\nnot yet been delivered (advance payments on orders).\\nThe net balance of operating uses and sources of funds is called the working capital.\\nIf uses of funds exceed sources of funds, the balance is positive and working capital \\nneeds to be financed. This is the most frequent case. If negative, it represents a source of \\nfunds generated by the operating cycle. This is a nice – but rare – situation!\\nIt is described as “working capital” because the figure reflects the cash required to \\ncover financing shortfalls arising from day-to-day operations.\\nSometimes working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. This \\ndefinition corresponds to our working capital definition + marketable securities and net \\ncash – short-term financial and banking borrowings. We think that this is an improper \\ndefinition of working capital as it mixes items from the operating cycle (inventories, \\nreceivables, payables) and items from the financing cycle (marketable securities, net cash \\nand short-term bank and financial borrowings). You may also find in some documents \\nexpressions such as “working capital needs” or “requirements in working capital”. These \\nare synonyms for working capital.\\nWorking capital can be divided between operating working capital and non-operating \\nworking capital.'),\n",

Under no circumstances should an unusually large figure for inventories \\nof raw materials and goods for resale be included in the calculation of operating working \\ncapital.\\nWhere appropriate, the excess portion of inventories or the amount considered \\nas inventory held for speculative purposes can be treated as a high-risk short-term \\ninvestment.\\nWorking capital is totally independent of the methods used to value fixed assets, \\ndepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on fixed assets. However, it is influ-\\nenced by:\\ntinventory valuation methods;\\nt deferred income and cost (over one or more years);\\nt the company’s provisioning policy for current assets and operating liabilities and \\ncosts.\\nAs we shall see in Chapter 5, working capital represents a key principle of financial \\nanalysis.\\nThe amount of working capital depends on the accounting methods used to determine \\nearnings, as well as the operating cycle.\\nb) Non-operating working capital\\nAlthough we have considered the timing differences between inflows and outflows that \\narise during the operating cycle, we have, until now, always assumed that capital expen-\\nditures are paid for when purchased and that non-recurring costs are paid for when they \\nare recognised in the income statement.

Liabilities are classified in the order in which they fall due for repayment. Since \\nbalance sheets are published annually, a distinction between the short term and long term \\nturns on whether a liability is due in less than or more than one year. Accordingly, liabili-\\nties are classified into those due in the short term (less than one year), in the medium and \\nlong term (more than one year) and those that are not due for repayment.\\nLikewise, what the company owns can also be classified by duration as follows:\\nt assets that will have disappeared from the balance sheet by the following year, which \\ncomprise current assets in the vast majority of cases;\\nt assets that will still appear on the balance sheet the following year, which comprise \\nfixed assets in the vast majority of cases.\\nFrom a liquidity perspective, we classify liabilities by their due date, investments by their \\nmaturity date and assets as follows:\\nAssets are regarded as liquid where, as part of the normal operating cycle, they will be \\nmonetised in the same year.\\nThus they comprise (unless the operating cycle is unusually long) inventories and \\ntrade receivables.\\nAssets that, regardless of their nature (head ofﬁce, plant, etc.), are not intended for sale \\nduring the normal course of business are regarded as ﬁxed (non-current) and not liquid.\\nBalance sheet liquidity therefore derives from the fact that the turnover of assets (i.e. \\nthe speed at which they are monetised within the operating cycle) is faster than the turn-\\nover of liabilities (i.e. when they fall due). The maturity schedule of liabilities is known \\nin advance because it is defined contractually. However, the liquidity of current assets \\nis unpredictable (risk of sales flops or inventory write-downs, etc.). Consequently, the \\nclearly defined maturity structure of a company’s liabilities contrasts with the \\nunpredictable liquidity of its assets.\\nTherefore, short-term creditors will take into account differences between a company’s \\nasset liquidity and its liability structure. They will require the company to maintain cur-\\nrent assets at a level exceeding that of short-term liabilities to provide a margin of safety. \\nHence the sacrosanct rule in finance that each and every company must have assets due to \\nbe monetised in less than one year at least equal to its liabilities falling due within one year.\\n2/ SOLVENCY\\nSolvency reﬂects the ability of a company to honour its commitments in the event of \\nliquidation, i.e. if its operations are wound up and are put up for sale.\\nIn accounting terms, a company may be regarded as insolvent once its shareholders’ \\nequity turns negative. This means that it owes more than it owns.'),\n",

Net asset \\nvalue is an accounting and, in some instances, tax-related term, rather than a financial one.\\nThe book value of shareholders’ equity is equal to everything a company owns less \\neverything it already owes or may owe. Financiers often talk about net asset value, which \\nleads to confusion among non-specialists, who can construe them as total assets net of \\ndepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses.\\nBook value of equity is thus equal to the sum of:\\nﬁxed assets\\n+ current assets\\n− all liabilities of any kind\\nWhen a company is sold, the buyer will be keen to adopt an even stricter approach:\\nt by factoring in contingent liabilities (that do not appear on the balance sheet);\\nt by excluding worthless assets, i.e. of zero value.

If negative, it represents a source of funds, and we refer to a \\nreduction in operating working capital.\\nThe change in working capital merely represents a straightforward timing difference \\nbetween the balance of operating cash flows (operating cash flow) and the wealth created \\nby the operating cycle (EBITDA). As we shall see, it is important to remember that timing \\ndifferences may not necessarily be small, of limited importance, short or negligible in \\nany way.\\nThe analysis of changes in working capital is one of the pillars of ﬁnancial analysis.\\n4/ CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\\nCapital expenditures3 lead to a change in what the company owns without any immedi-\\nate increase or decrease in its wealth. Consequently, they are not shown directly on the \\nincome statement. Conversely, capital expenditures have a direct impact on the cash flow \\nstatement.\\nFrom a capital expenditure perspective, there is a fundamental difference separating \\nthe income statement and the cash ﬂow statement. The income statement spreads the \\ncapital expenditure charge over the entire life of the asset (through depreciation), while \\nthe cash ﬂow statement records it only in the period in which it is purchased.\\nA company’s capital expenditure process leads to both cash outflows that do not dimin-\\nish its wealth at all and the accounting recognition of impairment in the purchased assets \\nthrough depreciation and amortisation that does not reflect any cash outflows.\\nAccordingly, there is no direct link between cash flow and net income for the capital \\nexpenditure process, as we knew already.\\n5/ FINANCING\\nFinancing is, by its very nature, a cycle that is specific to inflows and outflows. Sources \\nof financing (new borrowings, capital increases, etc.) do not appear on the income state-\\nment, which shows only the remuneration paid on some of these resources, i.e. interest on \\nborrowings but not dividends on equity.4\\nOutflows representing a return on sources of financing may be analysed as either \\ncosts (i.e. interest) or a distribution of wealth created by the company among its equity \\ncapital providers (i.e. dividends).\\nThe distinction between capital and interest payments is not of paramount importance \\nin the cash ﬂow statement, but is essential in the income statement.\\n3 Or investments \\nin fixed assets.\\n4  Except in the \\nUK where com-\\npanies deduct \\ndividends from \\nnet income and \\nend the income \\nstatement with \\n“retained profit”.'),\n",

That said, we also need to \\nadd back certain non-cash costs (depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on \\nfixed assets) that were deducted on the way down the income statement but have no cash \\nimpact, to arrive at what is known as cash flow.\\nCash flow will appear in “cash at hand” only once the timing differences related to \\nthe operating cycle as measured by change in operating working capital have been taken \\ninto account.\\nLastly, the investing and financing cycles give rise to uses and sources of funds that \\nhave no immediate impact on net income.\\n1/ FROM NET INCOME TO CASH FLOW\\nAs we have just seen, depreciation, amortisation, impairment losses on fixed assets and \\nprovisions are non-cash costs that have no impact on a company’s cash position. From a \\ncash flow standpoint, they are no different from net income.\\nConsequently, they are added back to net income to show the total ﬁnancing generated \\ninternally by the company.\\nThese two items form the company’s cash flow, which accountants allocate between net \\nincome on the one hand, and depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on the \\nother hand, according to the relevant accounting and tax legislation.\\nCash ﬂow can therefore be calculated by adding certain non-cash charges net of write-\\nbacks to net income.\\nThe simplicity of the cash flow statement shown in Chapter 2 was probably evident to \\nour readers, but it would not fail to shock traditional accountants, who would find it hard \\nto accept that financial expense should be placed on a par with repayments of borrow-\\nings.

The former makes the company poorer, whereas the latter constitutes liability \\nmanagement.\\nAs a result, traditionalists have managed to establish the concept of cash flow. We \\nneed to point out that we would advise computing cash flow before any capital gains \\n(or losses) on asset disposals and before non-recurring items, simply because they are \\nnon-recurrent items. Cash flow is only relevant in a cash flow statement if it is not made \\nartificially volatile by inclusion of non-recurring items.\\nCash flow is not as pure a concept as EBITDA. That said, a direct link may be estab-\\nlished between these two concepts by deriving cash flow from the income statement using \\nthe top-down method:\\nor the bottom-up method:\\nCash flow is influenced by the same accounting policies as EBITDA. Likewise, it is not \\naffected by the accounting policies applied to tangible and intangible fixed assets.\\nNote that the calculation method differs slightly for consolidated accounts6 since the \\ncontribution to consolidated net profit made by equity-accounted income is replaced by \\nthe dividend payment received. This is attributable to the fact that the parent company \\ndoes not actually receive the earnings of an associate company6, since it does not control \\nit, but merely receives a dividend.\\nFurthermore, cash flow is calculated at group level without taking into account minor-\\nity interests. This seems logical since the parent company has control of and allocates the \\ncash flows of its fully-consolidated subsidiaries even if they are not fully owned. In the \\ncash flow statement, minority interests6 in the controlled subsidiaries are reflected only \\nthrough the dividend payments that they receive.\\nLastly, readers should beware of cash flow as there are nearly as many definitions of \\ncash flow as there are companies in the world!\\nThe preceding definition is widely used, but frequently free cash flows, cash flow \\nfrom operating activities and operating cash flow are simply called “cash flow” by some \\nprofessionals. So it is safest to check which cash flow they are talking about.\\n6 For details \\non consolidated \\naccounts, see \\nChapter 6.\\nEBITDA\\n−\\n−\\n=\\nFinancial expense net of ﬁnancial income\\nCorporate income tax\\nCash ﬂow\\nNet income\\n+\\n+/−\\n+/−\\n=\\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses\\nCapital losses/gains on asset disposal\\nOther non-cash items\\nCash ﬂow'),\n",

On the one hand, one can \\ninfer relevant conclusions from changes in the net debt position of a company.

Cash ﬂow may be translated into an inﬂow or outﬂow of cash \\nonly once adjusted for the change in operating working capital to arrive at cash ﬂow from \\noperating activities in a broad sense of the term.\\nLastly, factoring in the investment cycle, which gives rise to outﬂows sometimes offset by \\nﬁxed asset disposals, and the equity ﬁnancing cycle, we arrive at the decrease in net debt.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/Do inventory valuation methods influence:\\n◦ the company’s net income?\\n◦ the company’s cash position?\\n2/Are net income and cash position, respectively, influenced by:\\n(a) depreciation and amortisation\\n(b) corporate income tax\\n(c) equity issue through cash contribution\\n(d) cash purchase of ﬁxed assets\\n(e) recognition and payment of salaries\\n(f) disposal for cash of an asset at its book value\\n(g) sale of goods on credit\\n(h) payment for these goods\\n(i) repayment of medium-term loan\\n(j) ﬁnancial expenses.\\n3/What differences are there between cash flow from operating activities and operating \\ncash flow?\\n4/What non-cash charges must be factored back into calculations of cash flow?\\n5/Is cash flow a measure of an increase in wealth?

This chapter deals with the basic aspects of \\nconsolidation that should be understood by anyone interested in corporate finance.\\nAn analysis of the accounting documents of each individual company belonging to \\na group does not serve as a very accurate or useful guide to the economic health of the \\nwhole group. The accounts of a company reflect the other companies that it controls only \\nthrough the book value of its shareholdings (revalued or written down, where appropriate) \\nand the size of the dividends that it receives.\\nThe purpose of consolidated accounts is to present the ﬁnancial situation of a group of \\ncompanies as if they formed one single entity.\\nThe goal of this chapter is to familiarise readers with the problems arising from \\nconsolidation. Consequently, we present an example-based guide to the main aspects of \\nconsolidation in order to facilitate analysis of consolidated accounts.\\nSection 6.1\\nCONSOLIDATION METHODS\\nAny firm that controls other companies exclusively or that exercises significant influence \\nover them should prepare consolidated accounts and a management report for the group.1\\nConsolidated accounts must be certified by the statutory auditors and, together with \\nthe group’s management report, made available to shareholders, debtholders and all other \\nparties with a vested interest in the company.\\nListed European companies have been required to use IFRS 2 accounting principles \\nfor their consolidated financial statements since 2005 and groups from most other coun-\\ntries have been required or allowed to use these accounting standards since then.\\n1  Unless (i) the \\nparent is itself \\na wholly owned \\nsubsidiary or is \\nvirtually wholly \\nowned and (ii) its \\nsecurities are not \\nlisted or about \\nto be and (iii) \\nthe immediate or \\nultimate parent \\nissues consoli-\\ndated accounts.\\n2IFRS rules \\nare produced by \\nthe International \\nAccounting\\nStandards Board \\n(IASB), a private \\norganisation \\nmade up mainly \\nof  accountants\\nfrom various \\nparts of the \\nworld.'),\n",

The scope of consolidation comprises:\\nt the parent company;\\nt the companies in which the parent company has a material influence (which is \\nassumed when the parent company holds at least 20% of the voting rights).\\nHowever, a subsidiary should not be consolidated when its parent loses the power \\nto govern its financial and operating policies, for example when the subsidiary becomes \\nsubject to the control of a government, a court or an administration. Such subsidiaries \\nshould be accounted for at fair market value.\\nThe basic principle behind consolidation consists of replacing the historical cost of the \\nparent’s investment in the company being consolidated with its assets, liabilities and \\nequity.\\nFor instance, let us consider a company with a subsidiary that appears on its balance \\nsheet with an amount of 20. Consolidation entails replacing the historical cost of 20 with \\nall or some of the assets, liabilities and equity of the company being consolidated.\\nThere are two methods of consolidation which are used depending on the strength of \\nthe parent company’s control or influence over its subsidiary:\\nType of relationship Type of company Consolidation method\\nControl Subsidiary Full consolidation 3\\nSigniﬁcant inﬂuence Associate Equity method\\n3  Or simply \\nconsolidation\\nWe will now examine each of these two methods in terms of its impact on sales, net \\nprofit and shareholders’ equity.\\n1/ FULL CONSOLIDATION\\nThe accounts of a subsidiary are fully consolidated if the latter is controlled by its \\nparent. Control is defined as the ability to direct the strategic financing and operating \\npolicies of an entity so as to access benefits. It is presumed to exist when the parent \\ncompany:\\ntholds, directly or indirectly, over 50% of the voting rights in its subsidiary;\\nt holds, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the voting rights but has power over \\nmore than 50% of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with other investors;\\nt has power to govern the financial and operating policies of the subsidiary under a \\nstatute or an agreement;\\nt has power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors; or\\nt has power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board.\\nThe criterion of exclusive control is the key factor under IFRS standards. Under US \\nGAAP, the determining factor is whether or not the parent company holds the majority '),\n",

Nevertheless, the definition is broader and can encompass companies in \\nwhich only a minority is held (or even no shares at all!).\\nAs its name suggests, full consolidation consists of transferring all the subsidiary’s \\nassets, liabilities and equity to the parent company’s balance sheet and all the revenues \\nand costs to the parent company’s income statement.\\nThe assets, liabilities and equity thus replace the investments held by the parent com-\\npany, which therefore disappear from its balance sheet.\\nThat said, when the subsidiary is not controlled exclusively by the parent company, \\nthe claims of the other “minority” shareholders on the subsidiary’s equity and net income \\nalso need to be shown on the consolidated balance sheet and income statement of the \\ngroup.\\nAssuming there is no difference between the book value of the parent’s investment in \\nthe subsidiary and the share of the book value of the subsidiary’s equity,4 full consolida-\\ntion works as follows:\\ntOn the balance sheet:\\n○ the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities are added item by item to the parent com-\\npany’s balance sheet;\\n○ the historical cost amount of the shares in the consolidated subsidiary held by \\nthe parent is eliminated from the parent company’s balance sheet and the same \\namount is deducted from the parent company’s reserves;\\n○ the subsidiary’s equity (including net income) is added to the parent company’s \\nequity and then allocated between the interests of the parent company (added to its \\nreserves) and those of minority investors in the subsidiary (if the parent company \\ndoes not hold 100% of the capital), which is added to a special minority interests\\nline below the line item showing the parent company’s shareholders’ equity.\\nt On the income statement, all the subsidiary’s revenues and charges are added item by \\nitem to the parent company’s income statement. The parent company’s net income is \\nthen broken down into:\\n○ the portion attributable to the parent company, which is added to the parent com-\\npany’s net income on both the income statement and the balance sheet;\\n○ the portion attributable to third-party investors, which is shown on a separate line \\nof the income statement under the heading “minority interests”.\\nMinority interests represent the share attributable to minority shareholders in the share-\\nholders’ equity and net income of fully consolidated subsidiaries.\\nFrom a solvency standpoint, minority interests certainly represent shareholders’ equity. \\nBut from a valuation standpoint, they add no value to the group since minority interests \\nrepresent shareholders’ equity and net profit attributable to third parties and not to share-\\nholders of the parent company.\\nRight up until the penultimate line of the income statement, financial analysis \\nassumes that the parent company owns 100% of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities and \\nimplicitly that all the liabilities finance all the assets. This is true from an economic, but \\nnot from a legal, perspective.\\nTo illustrate the full consolidation method, consider the following example assuming \\nthat the parent company owns 75% of the subsidiary company.\\n4 Which means \\n“no goodwill”, a \\ntopic to which we \\nwill return.'),\n",

Significant \\ninfluence over the operating and financial policy of a company is assumed when the par-\\nent holds, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of the voting rights. Significant influence \\nmay be reflected by participation on the executive and supervisory bodies, participation in \\nstrategic decisions, the existence of major intercompany links, exchanges of management \\npersonnel and a relationship of dependence from a technical standpoint.\\nMost companies that were consolidated under the proportionate method  are \\nnow consolidated under the equity method since the former method has been banned \\nby IFRS.\\nEquity accounting consists of replacing the carrying amount of the shares held in an \\nassociate (also known as an equity affiliate or associated undertaking) with the corre-\\nsponding portion of the associate’s shareholders’ equity (including net income).\\nThis method is purely financial. Both the group’s investments and aggregate profit \\nare thus reassessed on an annual basis. Accordingly, the IASB regards equity accounting \\nas being more of a valuation method than a method of consolidation.\\nFrom a technical standpoint, equity accounting takes place as follows:\\nt the historical cost amount of shares held in the associate is subtracted from the parent \\ncompany’s investments and replaced by the share attributable to the parent company \\nin the associate’s shareholders’ equity including net income for the year;\\nt the carrying value of the associate’s shares is subtracted from the parent company’s \\nreserves, to which is added the share in the associate’s shareholders’ equity, exclud-\\ning the associate’s income attributable to the parent company;\\nt the portion of the associate’s net income attributable to the parent company is added \\nto its net income on the balance sheet and the income statement.\\nInvestments in associates represent the share attributable to the parent company in \\nassociates’ shareholders’ equity.\\nThe equity method of accounting therefore leads to an increase each year in the carrying \\namount of the shareholding on the consolidated balance sheet, by an amount equal to its \\nshare of the net income transferred to reserves by the associate.\\nHowever, from a solvency standpoint, this method does not provide any clue to the \\ngroup’s risk exposure and liabilities vis-à-vis its associate. The implication is that \\nthe group’s risk exposure is restricted to the value of its shareholding.'),\n",

Although \\ncontrol is assessed in a broader way in IFRS (see page 71), the percentage of voting rights \\nthat the parent company controls (what we call here “level of control”) will be a key \\nindication to determine whether the subsidiary is controlled or significantly influenced.\\nTo calculate the level of control, we must look at the percentage of voting rights held \\nby all group companies in the subsidiary provided that the group companies are controlled \\ndirectly or indirectly by the parent company.\\nControl is assumed when the percentage of voting rights held is 50% or higher or \\nwhen a situation of de facto control exists at each link in the chain.\\nIt is important not to confuse the level of control with the level of ownership. Gener-\\nally speaking, these two concepts are different. The ownership level7 is used to calculate \\nthe parent company’s claims on its subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. It reflects the \\nproportion of their capital held directly or indirectly by the parent company. It is a finan-\\ncial concept, unlike the level of control which is a power-related concept.\\nThe ownership level is the sum of the product of the direct and indirect percentage \\nstakes held by the parent company in a given company. The ownership level differs from \\nthe level of control which considers only the controlled subsidiaries.\\nConsider the following example:\\n6 Or percentage \\ncontrol.\\n7Or percentage \\ninterest.\\nScope of consolidation\\nA\\nB\\nDE\\nC\\n15%\\n70%\\n60% 20%\\n10%\\nA controls 60% of B, B controls 70% of D, so A controls 70% of D. D and B are therefore \\nconsidered as controlled and thus fully consolidated by A. But A does not own 70%, but \\n42% of D (i.e. 60% × 70%). The ownership level of A over D is then 42%: only 42% of \\nD’s net income is attributable to A.\\nSince C owns just 10% of E, C will not consolidate E. Neither will D as it only owns \\n15% of E. But since A controls 20% of C, A will account for C under the equity method \\nand will show 20% of C’s net income in its income statement.'),\n",

The \\npercentage of control of A over E is 15%.\\nHow the ownership level is used varies from one consolidation method to another:\\nt with full consolidation, the ownership level is used only to allocate the subsidiary’s \\nreserves and net income between the parent company and minority interests in the \\nsubsidiary;\\nt with the equity method of accounting, the ownership level is used to determine the \\nportion of the subsidiary’s shareholders’ equity and net income attributable to the \\nparent company.\\n(b) Changes in the scope of consolidation\\nIt is important to analyse the scope of consolidation, especially with regard to what has \\nchanged and what is excluded. A decision not to consolidate a company means:\\ntneither its losses nor its shareholders’ equity will appear on the balance sheet8 of the \\ngroup;\\nt its liabilities will not appear on the balance sheet of the group.\\nCertain techniques can be used to remove subsidiaries still controlled by the parent com-\\npany from the scope of consolidation. These techniques have been developed to make \\ncertain consolidated accounts look more attractive. These techniques frequently involve \\na special-purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV is a separate legal entity created specially to \\nhandle a venture on behalf of a company. In many cases, from a legal standpoint the SPV \\nbelongs to banks or to investors rather than to the company. That said, the IASB has stipu-\\nlated that the company should consolidate the SPV if:\\ntit enjoys the majority of the benefits; or\\nt it incurs the residual risks arising from the SPV even if it does not own a single share \\nof the SPV .\\nThese rules make it very difficult to use this type of scheme under IFRS or US GAAP.\\nChanges in the scope of consolidation require the preparation of pro forma financial \\nstatements. Pro forma statements enable analysts to compare the company’s performances \\non a consistent basis. In these pro forma statements, the company may either:\\ntrestate past accounts to make them comparable with the current scope of consolida-\\ntion; or\\nt remove from the current scope of consolidation any item that was not present in the \\nprevious period to maintain its previous configuration. This latter option is, however, \\nless interesting for financial analysts.\\n2/ GOODWILL\\nIt is very unusual for one company to acquire another for exactly its book value.\\nGenerally speaking, there is a difference between the acquisition price, which may \\nbe paid in cash or in shares, and the portion of the target company’s shareholders’ equity \\nattributable to the parent company. In most cases, this difference is positive as the price \\npaid exceeds the target’s book value.\\n8 Unless the \\nlosses are \\nsuch that the \\nportion of the \\nsubsidiary’s \\nshareholders’ \\nequity attribut-\\nable to the parent \\ncompany is \\nlower than the \\nnet book value of \\nthe shares in the \\nsubsidiary held \\nby the parent. In \\nwhich case, an \\nimpairment loss \\nis recognised on \\nthe shareholding.'),\n",

There are several possible explanations:\\ntthe assets recorded on the acquired company’s balance sheet are worth more than \\ntheir carrying cost. This situation may result from the prudence principle, which \\nmeans that unrealised capital losses have to be taken into account, but not unrealised \\ncapital gains;\\nt it is perfectly conceivable that assets such as patents, licences and market shares that \\nthe company has accumulated over the years without wishing to, or even being able \\nto, account for them, may not appear on the balance sheet. This situation is especially \\ntrue if the company is highly profitable;\\nt the merger between the two companies may create synergies, either in the form of \\ncost reductions and/or revenue enhancement. The buyer is likely to partly reflect \\nthem in the price offered to the seller;\\nt the buyer may be ready to pay a high price for a target just to prevent a new player \\nfrom buying it, entering the market, and putting the current level of the buyer’s profit-\\nability under pressure;\\nt finally, the buyer may quite simply have overpaid for the deal.\\n(b) How is goodwill accounted for?\\nThe difference between the acquisition price and the portion of the target company’s \\nshareholders’ equity attributable to the parent company is accounted for in two parts.\\nOne corresponds to the latent capital gains and losses on assets and liabilities consoli-\\ndated for the first time. They are added to the relevant assets and liabilities which appear \\nin the consolidated balance sheet at their market value at the date of the acquisition. In this \\ncase, the intangible assets acquired, i.e. brands, patents, licences, landing slots, databases, \\netc., are recorded on the group’s balance sheet even if they did not originally appear on \\nthe acquired company’s balance sheet.\\nThe other one, which is not related to any specific item on the balance sheet, is \\nthe difference between the price paid and the fair value of the assets acquired following \\ndeduction of the liabilities assumed. It is called goodwill. Goodwill is shown under intan-\\ngible fixed assets of the new group’s balance sheet.\\nThis method is known as the purchase method and it gives rise to the purchase price \\nallocation (PPA for friends and family).\\nAssets and liabilities of the acquired companies are thus revalued when they are con-\\nsolidated for the first time, and the accounts of the acquired company are adjusted to bring \\nthem into line with the accounting policies applied by its new parent company.\\nGoodwill is assessed each year to verify whether its value is at least equal to its net \\nbook value as shown on the group’s balance sheet. This assessment is called an impair-\\nment test. If the market value of goodwill is below its book value, goodwill is written \\ndown to its fair market value and a corresponding impairment loss is recorded in the \\nincome statement.\\nTo illustrate the purchase method, let’s analyse now how LVMH accounted for the \\nacquisition of Bulgari in 2011.'),\n",

As we know, goodwill has a limited lifespan in view of the \\ncompetition prevailing in the business world that will, sooner or later, erode too high a \\nproﬁtability obtained after an acquisition.\\nCan it be argued that goodwill impairment losses do not reflect any decrease in the com-\\npany’s wealth because there is no outflow of cash? We do not think so.\\nGranted, goodwill impairment losses are a non-cash item, but it would be wrong to \\nsay that only decisions giving rise to cash flows affect a company’s value. For instance, \\nsetting a maximum limit on voting rights or attributing 10 voting rights to certain catego-\\nries of shares does not have any cash impact, but definitely reduces the value of sharehold-\\ners’ equity.\\nRecognising the impairment of goodwill related to a past acquisition is tantamount \\nto admitting that the price paid was too high. But what if the acquisition was paid for in \\nshares? This makes no difference whatsoever, irrespective of whether the buyer’s shares \\nwere overvalued at the same time.\\nHad the company carried out a share issue rather than overpaying for an acquisi-\\ntion, it would have been able to capitalise on its lofty share price to the great benefit of \\nexisting shareholders. The cash raised through the share issue would have been used \\nto make acquisitions at much more reasonable prices once the wave of euphoria had \\nsubsided. \\nIt is essential to remember that shareholders in a company which pays for a deal in \\nshares suffer dilution in their interest. They accept this dilution because they take the \\nview that the size of the cake will grow at a faster rate (e.g. by 30%) than the number of \\nguests invited to the party (e.g. by over 25%). Should it transpire that the cake grows at \\nmerely 10% rather than the expected 30% because the purchased assets prove to be worth \\nless than anticipated, the number of guests at the party will unfortunately stay the same. \\nAccordingly, the size of each guest’s slice of the cake falls by 12% (110/125-1), so share-\\nholders’ wealth has certainly diminished.\\n(d)How should ﬁnancial analysts treat “adjusted income”?\\nIn certain specific sectors (like the pharmaceutical sector), following an acquisition, the \\nacquirer publishes an “adjusted income” to neutralise the P&L impact of the revaluation \\nof assets and liabilities of its newly acquired subsidiary. Naturally, a P&L account is \\ndrawn up under normal standards, but it carries an audited table showing the impact of \\nthe switch to adjusted income.\\nAs a matter of fact, by virtue of the revaluation of the target’s inventories to their \\nmarket value, the normal process of selling the inventories generates no profit. So how \\nrelevant will the P&L be in the first year after the merger? This issue becomes critical only \\nwhen the production cycle is very long and therefore the revaluation of inventories (and \\npotentially research and development capitalised) is material.\\nWe believe that for those specific sectors, groups are right to show this adjusted \\nP&L.'),\n",

This is particularly true for provisions, depre-\\nciation and amortisation, fixed assets, inventories and work in progress, deferred charges \\nand shareholders’ equity.\\nThese differences need to be eliminated upon consolidation. This process is facili-\\ntated by the fact that most of the time consolidated accounts are not prepared to calculate \\ntaxable income, so groups may disregard the prevailing tax regulations.\\nPrior to consolidation, the consolidating company needs to restate the accounts of \\nthe to-be-consolidated companies. The consolidating company applies the same valua-\\ntion principles and makes adjustments for the impact of the valuation differences that are \\njustified on tax grounds, e.g. tax-regulated provisions, accelerated depreciation for tax \\npurposes and so on.\\n2/ ELIMINATING INTRA -GROUP TRANSACTIONS\\nConsolidation entails more than the mere aggregation of accounts. Before the consolida-\\ntion process as such can begin, intra-group transactions and their impact on net income \\nhave to be eliminated from the accounts of both the parent company and its consolidated \\ncompanies.\\nAssume, for instance, that the parent company has sold to subsidiaries products at \\ncost plus a margin. An entirely fictitious gain would show up in the group’s accounts if \\nthe relevant products were merely held in stock by the subsidiaries rather than being sold \\non to third parties. Naturally, this fictitious gain, which would be a distortion of reality, \\nneeds to be eliminated.\\nIntra-group transactions to be eliminated upon consolidation can be broken down \\ninto two categories:\\ntThose that are very significant because they affect consolidated net income. It is \\ntherefore vital for such transactions to be reversed. The goal is to avoid showing two \\nprofits or showing the same profit twice in two different years. The reversal of these \\ntransactions upon consolidation leads primarily to the elimination of:\\n○ intra-group profits included in inventories;\\n○ capital gains arising on the transfer or contribution of investments;\\n○ dividends received from consolidated companies;\\n○ impairment losses on intra-group loans or investments; and\\n○ tax on intra-group profits.'),\n",

These \\ntransactions are eliminated through netting, so as to show the real level of the group’s \\ndebt. They include:\\n○ parent-to-subsidiary loans (advances to the subsidiary) and vice versa;\\n○ interest paid by the parent company to the consolidated companies (financial \\nincome of the latter) and vice versa.\\n3/ TRANSLATING THE ACCOUNTS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\\n(a) The problem\\nThe translation of the accounts of foreign companies is a tricky issue because of exchange \\nrate fluctuations and the difference between inflation rates, which may distort the picture \\nprovided by company accounts.\\nFor instance, a parent company located in the eurozone may own a subsidiary in a \\ncountry with a soft currency.13\\nUsing year-end exchange rates to convert the assets of its subsidiary into the parent \\ncompany’s currency understates their value. From an economic standpoint, all the assets \\ndo not suffer depreciation proportional to that of the subsidiary’s home currency.\\nOn the one hand, fixed assets are protected to some extent. Inflation means that it \\nwould cost more in the subsidiary’s local currency to replace them after the devaluation \\nin the currency than before. All in all, the inflation and devaluation phenomena may actu-\\nally offset each other, so the value of the subsidiary’s fixed assets in the parent compa-\\nny’s currency is roughly stable. On the other hand, inventories, receivables and liabilities \\n(irrespective of their maturity) denominated in the devalued currency all depreciate in \\ntandem with the currency.\\nIf the subsidiary is located in a country with a hard currency (i.e. a stronger one \\nthan that of the parent company), the situation is similar, but the implications are \\nreversed.\\nTo present an accurate image of developments in the foreign subsidiary’s situation, it \\nis necessary to take into account:\\ntthe impact on the consolidated accounts of the translation of the subsidiary’s cur-\\nrency into the parent company’s currency;\\nt the adjustment that would stem from translation of the foreign subsidiary’s fixed \\nassets into the local currency.\\n(b) Methods\\nSeveral methods may be used at the same time to translate different items in the balance \\nsheet and income statement of foreign subsidiaries giving rise to currency translation \\ndifferences.\\ntIf the subsidiary is economically and financially independent of its parent company, \\nwhich is the most common situation, the closing rate method is used.\\n13  A soft or \\nweak currency is \\na currency that \\ntends to fall in \\nvalue because \\nof political \\nor economic \\nuncertainty (high \\ninflation rate).'),\n",

Currency translation differences are recorded under sharehold-\\ners’ equity, with a distinction being made between the group’s share and that attributable \\nto minority investors. This translation method is relatively comparable to the US standard.\\nThe temporal method consists of translating:\\nt monetary items (i.e. cash and sums receivable or payable denominated in the foreign \\ncompany’s currency and determined in advance) at the closing rate;\\nt non-monetary items (fixed assets and the corresponding depreciation and amorti-\\nsation,16 inventories, prepayments, shareholders’ equity, investments, etc.) at the \\nexchange rate at the date to which the historical cost or valuation pertains;\\nt revenues and charges on the income statement theoretically at the exchange rate pre-\\nvailing on the transaction date. In practice, however, they are usually translated at an \\naverage exchange rate for the period.\\nUnder the temporal method, the difference between the net income on the balance sheet \\nand that on the income statement is recorded on the income statement under foreign \\nexchange gains and losses.\\nThe temporal method is prescribed in the US.\\n(c) Translating the accounts of subsidiaries located in hyperinﬂationary countries\\nA hyperinflationary country is one where inflation is both chronic and out of control. In \\nsuch circumstances, the previous methods are not suitable for translating the effects of \\ninflation into the accounts.\\nHence the use of a specific method based on restatements made by applying a general \\nprice index. Elements such as monetary items that are already stated at the measuring unit \\nat the balance sheet date are not restated. Other elements are restated based on the change \\nin the general price index between the date those items were acquired or incurred and the \\nbalance sheet consolidation. A gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in \\nnet income.\\n14  Based on \\nthe historical \\nexchange rate \\nmethod.\\n15 This method \\nis also called \\nthecurrent rate \\nmethod.\\n16 As an \\nexception to this \\nrule, goodwill is \\ntranslated at the \\nclosing rate.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nConsolidation aims at presenting the ﬁnancial position of a group of companies as if they \\nformed one single entity. It is an obligation for companies that exclusively control other \\ncompanies or exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over them. The scope of consolidation encom-\\npasses the parent company and the companies in which the parent company holds at least \\n20% of the voting rights. The basic principle of consolidation is to replace the book value of \\ninvestments on the parent company’s balance sheet with the assets, liabilities and equity of \\nthe consolidated subsidiaries.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

This method gives rise to minority \\ninterests in the subsidiary’s net income and shareholders’ equity.\\nWhere the parent company exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence (usually by holding over 20% of \\nthe voting rights) over another company (hence called an associate), the equity method of \\naccounting is used. The book value of investments is replaced by the parent company’s share \\nin the associate’s equity (including net income). This method is actually equivalent to an \\nannual revaluation of these investments.\\nFrom a ﬁnancial standpoint, the ownership level, which represents the percentage of the \\ncapital held directly or indirectly by the parent company, is not equal to the level of control, \\nwhich reﬂects the proportion of voting rights held. The level of control is used to determine \\nwhich consolidation method is applied. The ownership level is used to separate the group’s \\ninterests from minorities’ interests in equity and net income.\\nA group often acquires a company by paying more than the book value of the company’s \\nequity. The difference is recorded as goodwill under intangible assets, minus any unrealised \\ncapital gains or losses on the acquired company’s assets and liabilities. This goodwill arising \\non consolidation is compared each year with its estimated value and written down to fair \\nmarket value, where appropriate.\\nWhen analysing a group, it is essential to ensure that the basic accounting data are con-\\nsistent from one company to another. Likewise, intra-group transactions, especially those \\naffecting consolidated net income (intra-group proﬁts, dividends received from subsidiaries, \\netc.), must be eliminated upon consolidation.\\nTwo methods are used to translate the accounts of foreign subsidiaries: the closing rate and \\nthe temporal method for currency exchange rate translations.

To accrue basically means to transfer revenue or costs from the P&L to \\nthe balance sheet.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nThe main categories of accruals are:\\ntprepaid costs, i.e. costs relating to goods or services to be supplied later. For instance, \\nthree-quarters of a rental charge payable in advance for a 12-month period on 1 Octo-\\nber each year will be recorded under prepaid costs on the asset side of the balance \\nsheet at 31 December;1\\nt deferred income, i.e. income accounted for before the corresponding goods or ser-\\nvices have been delivered or carried out. For instance, a cable company records three-\\nquarters of the annual subscription payments it receives on 1 October under deferred \\nincome on the liabilities side of its balance sheet at 31 December.1\\nWe should also mention accrued income and cost, which work in the same way as \\ndeferred income and prepaid cost, only in reverse. For example, a company can accrue \\nR&D costs, i.e. consider that it should not appear in the P&L but as an intangible asset \\nthat will be amortised or depreciated.\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nDeferred income and prepaid cost form part of operating working capital.\\nSection 7.2\\nCASH ASSETS\\n1/ WHAT ARE CASH ASSETS ?\\nCash assets correspond to short-term investment of a company’s cash surpluses (see \\nChapter 49).\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nFrom an accounting point of view, such investments can only be considered as cash equiv-\\nalent if they are very liquid, short term, easily converted into cash for a known amount and \\nexposed to a negligible risk of change in value.\\n1 If the com-\\npany’s financial \\nyear starts as of \\n1 January'),\n",

From an economic point of view, the analyst will try to \\nunderstand, first and foremost, whether the asset contributes to operating earnings (and \\nshould thus be integrated into capital employed), or if it is a financial investment (whether \\nlong or short term).

For \\ninstance, a group that builds dams or ships may work for several years on a single project.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nConstruction contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method, \\nwhich consists of recognising at the end of each financial year the sales and profit/loss \\nanticipated on the project in proportion to the percentage of the work completed at that \\ntime. US accounting rules recognise both the percentage of completion method and the \\ncompleted contract method where revenue recognition is deferred until completion of the \\ncontract.2\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nConstruction projects in progress are part of the operating working capital. The percent-\\nage of completion method results in less volatile profits as they are spread over several \\nfiscal years even if the completed contract method may seem more prudent. Analysts \\nshould be aware of changes in accounting methods for construction contracts (which are \\nnot possible under IFRS) as such changes may indicate an attempt to artificially improve \\nthe published net income for a given year.\\n2 The completed \\ncontract method \\nconsists of recog-\\nnising the sales \\nand earnings on \\na project only \\nwhen the project \\nhas been com-\\npleted or the last \\nbatch delivered. \\nNonetheless, by \\nvirtue of the con-\\nservatism prin-\\nciple, any losses \\nanticipated are \\nfully provisioned. \\nThis method is \\nthus equivalent \\nto recognising \\nonly unrealised \\nlosses while the \\nproject is under \\nway. It may be \\nused in the US \\nwhere the recom-\\nmended method \\nis the percentage \\nof completion \\nmethod.'),\n",

Conversion is thus initiated by the investor.3 If they are not \\nconverted, they are repaid in cash at maturity.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nWhen they are issued, convertible bonds and loans are allocated between debt and equity \\naccounts4 since they are analysed under IFRS standards as compound financial instru-\\nments made up of a straight bond and a call option (see Chapter 24). The present value \\nof the coupons and reimbursement amount discounted at a fair borrowing rate of the firm \\nis accounted for as debt. The remainder is accounted for as equity. In addition, each year \\nthe company will account for the interest as it would be paid for a standard bond (part of \\nthis amount corresponding to the actual amount paid, the rest being a notional amount).\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nThe approach we recommend is to examine the conditions governing conversion of the \\nbonds and to make the equity/debt classification based on the results of this analysis. For \\ninstance, if the share price already lies well above the conversion price, the bonds are very \\nlikely indeed to be converted, so they should be treated as equity. For valuation purposes, \\nthe related interest expense net of tax should be reversed out of the income statement, \\nleading to an increase in net income. The number of shares should also be increased by \\nthose to be issued through the conversion of the convertible bonds.\\nOn the other hand, if the share price is below the conversion price, convertible bonds \\nshould be treated as conventional bonds and stay classified as borrowings.\\nSection 7.5\\nCURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS\\nSee Chapter 6.\\nSection 7.6\\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\n1/ WHAT ARE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ?\\nDeferred taxation giving rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities stems from differences \\nbetween the taxable and book values of assets and liabilities.\\n3 See Chapter \\n24.\\n4 This is \\nknown as “split \\naccounting”.'),\n",

For instance, a cost has been recognised in the \\naccounts, but is not yet deductible for tax purposes (e.g. employee profit-sharing in some \\ncountries), or vice versa. The same may apply to certain types of revenue. Such differ-\\nences are known as timing differences.\\nIn other circumstances, the differences may be definitive or permanent, i.e. for rev-\\nenue or charges that will never be taken into account in the computation of taxable profit \\n(e.g. tax penalties or fines that are not deductible for tax purposes). Consequently, there is \\nno deferred tax recognition.\\nOn the balance sheet, the historical cost of an asset or liability may not be the same \\nas its tax base, which creates a temporary difference. Depending on the situation, tem-\\nporary differences may give rise to a future tax charge and thus deferred tax liabilities, \\nwhile others may lead to future tax deductions and thus deferred tax assets. For instance, \\ndeferred tax liabilities may arise from:\\ntassets that give rise to tax deductions that are lower than their book value when sold \\nor used. The most common example of this derives from the revaluation of assets \\nupon the first-time consolidation of a subsidiary. Their value on the consolidated bal-\\nance sheet is higher than the tax base used to calculate depreciation and amortisation \\nor capital gains and losses;\\nt capitalised financial costs that are deductible immediately for tax purposes, but that \\nare accounted for on the income statement over several years or deferred;\\nt revenues, the taxation of which is deferred, such as accrued financial income that \\nbecomes taxable only once it has been actually received.\\nDeferred tax assets may arise in various situations including costs that are expensed \\nin the accounts but are deductible for tax purposes in later years only, such as:\\ntprovisions that are deductible only when the stated risk or liability materialises (for \\nretirement indemnities in certain countries);\\nt certain tax losses that may be offset against tax expense in the future (i.e. tax-loss \\ncarryforwards, long-term capital losses).\\nFinally, if the company were to take certain decisions, it would have to pay additional \\ntax. These taxes represent contingent tax liabilities, e.g. stemming from the distribution \\nof reserves on which tax has not been paid at the standard rate.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nIt is mandatory for companies to recognise all their deferred tax liabilities in consolidated \\naccounts. Deferred tax assets arising from tax losses should be recognised when it is prob-\\nable that the deferred tax asset can be used to reduce tax to be paid.\\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognised on goodwill where goodwill depreciation \\nis not deductible for tax purposes, as is the case in the UK, Italy or France.

As examples one may think about tax \\ncharges payable if certain reserves are distributed (i.e. dividend withholding tax), or if \\nassets are sold and a capital gain is registered, etc. The principle governing contingent \\ntaxation is straightforward: it is not recorded on the balance sheet and no charge appears \\non the income statement.\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nIt is important to recognise that deferred taxation does not represent an amount of tax \\ncurrently due to or from the tax authorities, but consists of accounting entries with, \\nmost of the time, no economic underpinnings and with no corresponding cash ﬂows.\\n(a) The simple case of losses\\nA group makes a pre-tax book and tax loss of 100. From a tax point of view, the tax due is \\nzero. From an accounting point of view, and if there is reason to believe that the company \\nis likely to make profits in the future that will enable it to use this tax-loss carryforward, \\nthe loss will be reduced by a tax credit of 34.5 Accordingly, it will be booked at 66. In \\norder to balance the books, a tax credit carryforward of 34 will be recognised in the bal-\\nance sheet on the assets side.\\nThe following year, if our group makes an accounting and taxable profit of 100, it \\nwill not pay any tax, as the tax-loss carryforward created that year will be set off against \\nthe tax due. From an accounting point of view, we’ll recognise a theoretical tax expense \\nof 34 and reduce the deferred tax recognised previously in the balance sheet to 0.\\nThis example clearly shows that the deferred tax credit was created by reducing the \\namount of the net accounting loss and thus increasing equity by the same amount. From a \\nfinancial point of view, it is only of value if future operations are able to generate enough \\nprofits. But under no circumstances can it be considered as an ordinary asset that could \\nbe sold for cash. And it is most certainly not an element of working capital as it does not \\nresult from the time lapse between the billing date and the payment date. We’ll consider \\nit as a fixed asset. At worst, it could be reversed against shareholders’ equity, if there are \\nserious doubts about the company’s future ability to make profits.\\n(b) The case of provisions that are not immediately tax-deductible\\nIn some countries, provisions for retirement benefits, restructuring and environmental \\nrisks are not tax-deductible when they are recognised. They are only tax-deductible when \\nthe related expense is paid. The accounting rule for consolidated accounts is different \\nbecause allocations to these provisions are treated as tax-deductible when they are rec-\\nognised. This is what results in the gap between real flows and the accounting treatment.\\n5 At a corpora-\\ntion tax rate of \\n34%.'),\n",

This year, it \\nmust allocate 100 to a reserve to cover a risk that may materialise in three years. From \\natax point of view , the net result is 66 6 as the reserve is not tax-deductible and the tax \\nrecognised is 34. From an accounting point of view , as the reserve of 100 is a cost, \\nthe net result is 0. The tax effectively paid (34) appears on the income statement but is \\nneutralised by a deferred tax income of 34 which, in order to balance the books, is also \\nrecorded on the assets side of the balance sheet. Finally, the net tax recorded on the \\nincome statement is 0.\\nIn three years, all other things being equal, the net tax result is 0 since the cost \\nis tax-deductible, and the tax effectively paid that year is thus 0. From an accounting\\npoint of view, the written-back provision cancels out the expense, so the pre-tax result is \\n100 − 100 (cost) + 100 (provision written back) = 100. The tax recognised by accoun-\\ntants is 34 which is split into 0 tax paid and 34 recognised through deduction from the \\ndeferred tax credit recognised in the balance sheet three years ago, which is thus used up.\\nThe deferred tax credit carried on the balance sheet for three years has a cross-entry \\nunder equity capital that is higher by 34. This is tax that has already been paid but from \\nan accounting point of view is considered as a future expense. Unlike inventories of raw \\nmaterials which have been paid for and which are also a future expense, deferred tax has \\nno monetary value.\\nThe financial treatment we advocate is simple: it is cancelled from assets and \\ndeducted from the provision under liabilities (so that it appears after tax) or from equity \\nto reverse the initial entry.\\n(c)Revaluing assets\\nRevaluing an asset when it is first consolidated or subsequently (when tested for impair-\\nment)7 has two consequences:\\nt The taxable capital gains if the asset is sold will be different from the book value of \\nthe capital gains recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\\nt The basis for depreciation will be different, and will thus generate deferred taxes.\\nA group acquires a new subsidiary which has land recorded on its balance sheet at its \\ninitial acquisition value of 100. This land is revalued in the consolidated financial state-\\nments at 150.\\nWe will then book a deferred tax liability of (150 − 100) × 34% = 17 in the con-\\nsolidated financial statements. What is this liability from an economic point of view? It is \\nthe difference that will be booked in the consolidated financial statements between the tax \\nactually paid on the day when the land is sold at a price of P − (P − 100) × 34% and the \\ntax that will be recognised (P − 150) × 34%. The cross-entry on the balance sheet for this \\ndeferred tax is a lesser reduction of goodwill, which is reduced not by 50 but by (50 − 17).\\nIs this a debt owed to the tax administration? Clearly not, since the land would have \\nto be sold for a tax liability to appear and then for an amount of (P − 100) × 34% and \\nprobably not 17! How do we advise our readers to treat this deferred tax liability? Deduct \\nit from goodwill.\\nSo, what of the case of the asset that has been revalued but that is depreciable? There \\nis an initial recognition of the deferred tax liability being gradually reduced over the dura-\\ntion of the residual life of the asset by deferred tax credits due to the difference between \\na tax depreciation calculated on the basis of 100 and book depreciation calculated on the \\nbasis of 150.\\n6 At a corpora-\\ntion tax rate of \\n34%.\\n7See Chapter 6.'),\n",

A capital increase of 80 \\nthen takes place, valuing the subsidiary at a total of 400. Since the parent company does \\nnot take up its allocation, its shareholding is diluted from 50% to 41.67%.\\nThe parent company’s share of the subsidiary’s equity increases from 50% × 100 =\\n50 to 41.67% × (100 + 80) = 75, which generates a non-recurrent gain of 75 − 50 = 25. \\nThis profit of 25 corresponds exactly to the profit that the parent company would have \\nmade by selling an interest of 50% − 41.67% = 8.33% based on a valuation of 400 and a \\ncost price of 100 for 100%, since 25 = 8.33% × (400 − 100).\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nDilution gains and losses generate an accounting profit, whereas the parent company has \\nnot received any cash payments. They are, by their very nature, non-recurring. Otherwise, \\nthe group would soon not have any subsidiaries left.

This may arise out of a commer-\\ncial operation (receivable in foreign currency for example or a financial operation (such \\nas a debt at a variable rate)). They rely on derivatives such as options, futures, swaps, etc. \\n(see Chapter 50). \\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nAccounting for financial hedging instruments made up of derivatives (options, futures, \\nswaps, etc.) is extremely complicated under IFRS.'),\n",

However, in this case, the \\ncompany must be able to prove (and to document) that the hedge is practically perfectly \\nadjusted (amount, duration) to the underlying amount, otherwise the instrument in ques-\\ntion will not qualify for hedge accounting and its variations in value will appear on the \\nincome statement.\\nIFRS distinguishes between two types of hedge:\\nt fair value hedge, and\\nt cash flow hedge.\\nThe difference between the two is not always that clear.  For example, hedging \\nagainst a foreign exchange risk of a receivable in dollars could be considered to be a fair \\nvalue hedge since it is used to secure the value of this receivable or as a cash flow hedge \\nguaranteeing the counter value of the effective payment by the client.  \\n(a)Fair value hedges\\nOn principle, receivables and debts are booked at their historic cost (amortised cost) \\nwhile financial instruments are booked at their fair value. The application of these prin-\\nciples could lead to an absurd situation. Let’s take, for example, a company that hedges \\na fixed-rate debt with a swap. If the company closes its financial year before the debt \\nmatures, the change in the value of the debt has no impact on the income statement, while \\nthe change in the value of the swap does impact the income statement. This is so even \\nthough both can set each other off! \\nIn order to remedy this problem, IFRS recommend booking the changes in value of \\na receivable or a debt hedged by a financial instrument on the income statement. In this \\nway, the gains or losses on the underlying asset are set off by the losses or gains on the \\nhedging instrument. And there is no impact on the result.\\n(b) Cash ﬂow hedges\\nLet’s take the example of a chocolate producer that hedges the future price of cocoa with \\na forward purchase. The company closes its financial year after putting the hedging in \\nplace but before the actual purchase of the cocoa. If the price of cocoa has fallen since the \\nhedging was put in place, the principle of fair value applied to financial instruments holds \\nthat the company should book a loss in terms of the change in the value of the forward \\ncontract. This isn’t logical as this loss only exists because the company wanted to be sure \\nthat the price at which it was to purchase its cocoa was fixed in advance so as to eliminate \\nits risk. \\nThe change in value of the financial hedging instrument is booked on the asset side \\nand under equity (under “other comprehensive income”) without a loss or a gain being \\nrecorded on the income statement. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument only appear \\nwhen underlying flows effectively take place, i.e. at the time of the effective purchase of \\nthe cocoa in our example.  Our producer will then record a total expense (purchase price \\nof cocoa lower than forecast and loss on the forward contract) which will reflect the price \\nfixed in advance in its hedging contract.'),\n",

Each year, the recoverable value of the CGU is computed if there \\nis an indication that there might be a decrease in value or if it includes goodwill.9 If the \\nrecoverable value of the CGU is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss \\nneeds to be recognised.

This gives rise to \\nan accounting deficiency, which is especially critical in the mass consumer (e.g. food, \\ntextiles, automotive sectors) and luxury goods industries, particularly from a valuation \\nstandpoint. Brands have considerable value, so it makes no sense whatsoever not to take \\nthem into account in a company valuation. As we saw in Chapter 6, the allocation of \\ngoodwill on first-time consolidation to brands and market share leads to an accumulation \\nof such assets on groups’ balance sheets. For instance, LVMH carries brands for €11.5 \\nbillion on its balance sheet, which thus account for one-quarter of its capital employed. \\nSince the amortisation of brands is not tax-deductible in most countries, it has become \\ncommon practice not to amortise such assets so that they have an indefinite life. Brands \\nare, at most, written down where appropriate.\\nUnder IFRS, market share cannot be carried on the balance sheet unless the company \\nhas protection enabling it to protect or control its customer relationships (which is dif-\\nficult to get and demonstrate).\\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful life.

Such a view leads to deducting these items perempto-\\nrily from shareholders’ equity. We beg to differ with this approach.\\nThese items usually add considerably to a company’s valuation, even though they \\nmay be intangible. For instance, what value would a top fashion house or a consumer \\ngoods company have without its brands?\\n4/ CONCLUSION\\nTo sum up, our approach to intangible fixed items is as follows: the higher the book value \\nof intangibles, the lower their market value is likely to be; and the lower their book value, \\nthe more valuable they are likely to be. This situation is attributable to the accounting and \\nfinancial policy of a profitable company that seeks to minimise its tax expense as much as \\npossible by expensing every possible cost. Conversely, an ailing company or one that has \\nmade a very large acquisition may seek to maximise its intangible assets in order to keep \\nits net profit and shareholders’ equity in positive territory.\\nFrom a ﬁnancial standpoint, intangible ﬁxed assets form a key part of a company’s value. \\nThat said, we believe that their book value in a company’s balance sheet has little to do \\nwith ﬁnancial reality.

Finished products and work in progress are val-\\nued at production cost, which includes the acquisition cost of raw materials used, direct \\nand indirect production costs insofar as the latter may reasonably be allocated to the \\nproduction of an item.\\nCosts must be calculated based on normal levels of activity, since allocating the costs \\nof below-par business levels would be equivalent to deferring losses to future periods and \\nartificially inflating profit for the current year. In practice, this calculation is not always \\nproperly performed, so we would advise readers to closely follow the cost allocation.\\nFinancial charges, research and development costs and general and administrative \\ncosts are not usually included in the valuation of inventories unless specific operating \\nconditions justify such a decision. IFRS require interim interest payments12 to be included \\nin the cost of inventories; US GAAP allows interim interest payments to be included in \\ninventories in certain cases.\\nIn all sectors of activity where inventories account for a signiﬁcant proportion of the \\nassets, we would strongly urge readers to study closely the impact of inventory valuation \\nmethods on the company’s net income.\\n(b)Valuation methods\\nUnder IFRS, there are three main methods for valuing inventories:\\ntthe weighted average cost method;\\nt the FIFO (first in, first out) method;\\nt the identified purchase cost method.\\nWeighted average cost consists of valuing items withdrawn from the inventory at \\ntheir weighted average cost, which is equal to the total purchase cost divided by quantities \\npurchased.\\nThe FIFO (first in, first out) method values inventory withdrawals at the cost of the \\nitem that has been held in inventory for the longest.\\nThe identified purchase cost  is used for non-interchangeable items and goods or \\nservices produced and assigned to specific projects.\\nFor items that are interchangeable, the IASB allows the weighted average cost and \\nFIFO methods but no longer accepts the LIFO method (last in, first out) that values \\ninventory withdrawals at the cost of the most recent addition to the inventory. US GAAP \\npermits all methods (including LIFO) but the identified purchase cost method.\\nDuring periods of inflation, the FIFO method enables a company to post a higher \\nprofit than under the LIFO method. The FIFO method values items withdrawn from the \\ninventory at the purchase cost of the items that were held for longest and thus at the lowest \\ncost, hence giving a higher net income. The LIFO method produces a smaller net income \\nas it values items withdrawn from the inventory at the most recent, and thus the highest, \\npurchase cost. The net income figure generated by the weighted average cost method lies \\nmidway between these two figures.\\nAnalysts need to be particularly careful when a company changes its inventory valu-\\nation method. These changes, which must be disclosed and justified in the notes to the \\naccounts, make it harder to carry out comparisons between periods and may artificially \\ninflate net profit or help to curb a loss.\\n12 Interest on \\ncapital bor-\\nrowed to finance \\nproduction.'),\n",

Inven-\\ntories are assets booked by recognising deferred costs. Assuming quantities remain \\nunchanged, the higher the carrying amount of inventories, the lower future profits will \\nbe. Put more precisely, assuming inventory volumes remain constant in real terms, valua-\\ntion methods do not affect net profit for a given period. But, depending on the method \\nused, inventory receives a higher or lower valuation, making shareholders’ equity higher \\nor lower accordingly.\\nWhen inventories are being built up, the higher the carrying amount of inventories, the \\nfaster proﬁts will appear. The reverse is true when inventories are decreasing. Overvalued \\ninventories that are being run down generate a fall in net income.\\nHence the reluctance of certain managers to scale down their production even when \\ndemand contracts. Finally, we note that, tax-related effects apart, inventory valuation \\nmethods have no impact on a company’s cash position.\\nFrom a financial standpoint, it is true to say that the higher the level of inventories, \\nthe greater the vulnerability and uncertainty affecting net income for the given period. We \\nrecommend adopting a cash-oriented approach if, in addition, there is no market serv-\\ning as a point of reference for valuing inventories, such as in the building and public \\ninfrastructure sectors, for instance. In such circumstances, cash generated by operating \\nactivities is a much more reliable indicator than net income, which is much too heavily \\ninfluenced by the application of inventory valuation methods.\\nInventories are merely accruals (deferred costs), which are always slightly speculative \\nand arbitrary in nature, even when accounting rules are applied bona ﬁde.\\nConsequently, during inflationary periods , inventories carry unrealised capital \\ngains that are larger when inventories are moving more slowly. In the accounts, these \\ngains will appear only as these inventories are being sold, even though these gains are \\nthere already. When prices are falling, inventories carry real losses that will appear only \\ngradually in the accounts, unless the company writes down inventories.\\nThe only financial approach that makes sense would be to work on a replacement cost \\nbasis and thus to recognise gains and losses incurred on inventories each year. In some \\nsectors of activity where inventories move very slowly, this approach seems particularly \\nimportant. In the early 2000s Japanese banks carried loans on their books for amounts that \\nwere well above their value. We firmly believe that had loans been written down to their \\nmarket value, the ensuing crisis in the sector would have been less severe. The companies \\nwould have recognised losses in one year and then posted decent profits the next instead \\nof resorting to all kinds of creative solutions to defer losses. Banks with subprime credit \\nportfolios did not make the same mistake in 2007–2008.'),\n",

Even if those items may \\nnot appear on the balance sheet, they may represent a considerable part of a com-\\npany’s assets.\\nt Secondly, they represent a commitment, the extent of which varies depending on the \\ntype of contract:\\n○ equipment leasing may be treated as similar to debt depending on the length of \\nthe period during which the agreement may not be terminated;\\n○ real estate leasing for buildings may not be treated as actual debt in view of the \\ntermination clause contained in the contract. Nonetheless, the utility of the leased \\nproperty usually leads the company to see out the initially determined length of \\nthe lease, and the termination of the lease may then be treated as the early repay-\\nment of a borrowing (financed by the sale of the relevant asset).\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nA lease is either a finance lease or an operating lease.\\nA finance lease13 according to IASB is “a lease that transfers substantially all the risk \\nand rewards incident to ownership of an asset. Title may or may not eventually be trans-\\nferred.”14 Indications of the financial nature of a lease include:\\nt the contract sets that the asset will be transferred at the end of the lease to the company;\\nt the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at an “attractive” price;\\nt the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset;\\nt the present value of the rents are close to the fair value of the leased asset at the begin-\\nning of the contract;\\nt the assets leased are so specific that only the company can use them without major \\nchanges being made.\\nAlthough the idea is similar, US GAAP follows a more directive approach to \\ndistinguish financial and operating leases: an operating lease is a lease that is not a finance \\nlease.\\nUnder IFRS, finance leases are capitalised, which means they are recorded under \\nfixed assets and a corresponding amount is booked under financial debt.\\nThe lease payments to the lessor are treated partly as a repayment of financial debt \\nand partly as financial expense. The capitalised asset under a finance lease is depreciated \\nover its useful life. Accordingly, no rental costs are recorded on the income statement, \\nmerely financial and depreciation costs.\\n13 Capital lease \\nin the United \\nStates.\\n14 IAS 17 \\nchanges in finan-\\ncial position.'),\n",

It is there-\\nfore very important to analyse off-balance-sheet items because they reflect:\\ntthe degree of accounting ingenuity used by the company; this judgement provides the \\nbasis for an opinion about the quality of the published accounts;\\nt the impending arrival on the balance sheet of the effects of the commitments (e.g. \\npurchases of fixed assets or purchase commitments that will have to be financed with \\ndebt, guarantees given to a failed third party that will lead to losses and payments \\nwith nothing received in return).\\nThe key points to watch are as follows:\\n=\\nItem Comments\\nFinancial \\ncommitments\\nPledges and guarantees granted (including \\nrepresentations and warranties on disposal \\nof an asset, product warranties).\\nCommitments given as partners, whether \\nunlimited or not; put options written on \\nassets.\\nClawback commitments.\\nAnalyse the situation of \\nthe relevant entity to \\nestimate the size of the \\ncommitment.\\nLiabilities Debts backed by tangible collateral.

In addition, detailed information has to be pro-\\nvided to justify the assessment of the amount.\\nSection 7.14\\nPENSIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\n1/ WHAT ARE PROVISIONS FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND PENSIONS ?\\nPension and related commitments include severance payments, early retirement and \\nrelated payments, special retirement plans, top-up plans providing guaranteed resources '),\n",

This is a commitment to a certain level of \\nperformance, usually according to the final salary and length of service of the retiring \\nemployee. These plans may be managed internally or externally;\\nt defined contribution plans  where the employer commits to making regular pay-\\nments to an external organisation. Those payments are paid back to employees when \\nthey retire in the form of pensions together with the corresponding investment rev-\\nenue. The size of the pension payments depends on the investment performance of \\nthe external organisation managing the plan. The employer does not guarantee the \\nlevel of the pension paid (a resource-related obligation). This applies to most national \\nsocial security systems.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nDefined contribution plans are fairly simple to account for as contributions to these plans \\nare expensed each year as they are incurred.\\nDefined benefit plans require account holders to disclose detailed and specific infor-\\nmation. A defined benefit plan gives rise to a liability corresponding to the actuarial\\npresent value of all the pension payments due at the balance sheet closing date\\n(Defined benefit obligation or, in US GAAP, Projected Benefit Obligation – PBO).\\nIn countries where independent pension funds handle the company’s commitments to \\nits workforce, the market value of the pension fund’s assets is set off against the actuarial \\nvalue of the liability. The method used to assess the actuarial value is the projected unit \\ncredit method, which models the benefits vested with the entire workforce of the com-\\npany at the assessment date. It is based on certain demographics, staff turnover and other \\nassumptions (resignations, redundancies, mortality rates, etc.).\\nConsequently, the net pension costs in the income statement for a given year are \\nmainly composed of:\\nta service cost, which represents the present value of benefits earned by employees \\nduring the year;\\nt an interest cost, which represents the increase in the present value of the pensions \\npayments due at the balance sheet closing date since the previous year due to the pas-\\nsage of time; this is generally recognised in financial expense;\\nt a theoretical return on assets, computed using the discount rate used to compute the \\npresent value of pension payments due;15\\nt other non-recurring items.\\nIn a move that has broadened the debate, the IASB has stipulated that all benefits \\npayable to employees, i.e. retirement savings, pensions, insurance and healthcare cover \\nand severance payments, should be accounted for. These standards state in detail how the \\nemployee liabilities deriving from these benefits should be calculated. US accounting \\nstandards also provide for the inclusion of retirement benefits and commitments other \\nthan just pension obligations, i.e. mainly the reimbursement of medical costs by compa-\\nnies during the active service life of employees.\\n15 The differ-\\nence between the \\neffective yield \\nand the theoreti-\\ncal one is part of \\nother comprehen-\\nsive items which \\ndo not transit \\nthrough the profit \\nand loss account.'),\n",

This liability is adjusted each year to reflect the actuarial \\n(and automatic) increase in employees’ accrued benefits, just like a zero-coupon bond,16\\nwhere the company recognises an annual financial charge that is not paid until the bond is \\nredeemed. Consequently, we suggest treating such provisions minus the market value of \\nthe pension fund’s assets as financial debt.\\nIn the income statement, we regard only pension service costs as operating costs and \\nthe balance of net pension costs (interest costs, theoretical return on pension assets) as \\nfinancial charges. These must be deducted from EBITDA and EBIT and added to finan-\\ncial charges unless the company has already applied this rule in its accounts, as sometimes \\nhappens.\\nSection 7.15\\nPREFERENCE SHARES 17\\n1/ WHAT ARE PREFERENCE SHARES ?\\nPreference shares combine characteristics of shares and bonds. They may have a fixed \\ndividend (bonds pay interest), a redemption price (bonds), and a redemption date (bonds). \\nIf the company were to be liquidated, the preference shareholders would be paid a given \\namount before the common shareholders would have a right to receive any of the pro-\\nceeds. Sometimes the holders of preference shares may participate in earnings beyond the \\nordinary dividend rate, or have a cumulative feature allowing their dividends in arrears, if \\nany, to be paid in full before shareholders can get a dividend, and so on.\\nMost of the time, in exchange for these financial advantages, the preference shares \\nhave no voting rights. They are known as actions de préférence in France, Vorzugsaktien\\nin Germany, azioni risparmio in Italy, and preferred stock in the US.18\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nUnder IFRS, preference shares are accounted for either as equity or financial debt, depend-\\ning on the results of a “substance over form” analysis. If the preference share:\\ntprovides for mandatory redemption by the issuer at a fixed19 date in the future; or\\nt if the holder has a put option allowing him to sell the preference share back to the \\nissuer in the future; or\\nt if the preference share pays a fixed dividend regardless of the net income of the \\ncompany, \\nit is financial debt.\\nUnder US GAAP, preference shares are treated as equity.\\n16 See page. \\n291.\\n17  Also called \\npreferred shares.\\n18For more \\ndetails about \\npreference \\nshares, see \\nChapter 24.\\n19Or\\ndeterminable.'),\n",

If not, it is a financial debt.\\nSection 7.16\\nPROVISIONS\\nProvisions are set aside in anticipation of a future cost. Additions to provisions reduce net \\nincome in the year they are set aside and not in the year the corresponding cost will actu-\\nally be incurred. Provisions will actually be written back the year the corresponding charge \\nwill be incurred, thereby neutralising the impact of recognising the charges in the income \\nstatement. Additions to provisions are therefore equivalent to an anticipation of costs.\\n1/ RESTRUCTURING PROVISIONS\\n(a) What are restructuring provisions?\\nRestructuring provisions consist of taking a heavy upfront charge against earnings in \\na given year to cover a restructuring programme (site closures, redundancies, etc.). The \\nfuture costs of this restructuring programme are eliminated through the gradual write-\\nback of the provision, thereby smoothing future earnings performance.\\n(b)How are they accounted for?\\nRestructuring costs represent a liability if they derive from an obligation for a company \\nvis-à-vis third parties or members of its workforce. This liability must arise from a deci-\\nsion by the relevant authority and be confirmed prior to the end of the accounting period \\nby the announcement of this decision to third parties and the affected members of the \\nworkforce. The company must not anticipate anything more from those third parties or \\nmembers of its workforce. Conversely, a relocation leading to profits further ahead in the \\nfuture should not give rise to such a provision.\\n(c)How should ﬁnancial analysts treat them?\\nThe whole crux of the matter boils down to whether restructuring provisions should be \\nrecorded under operating or non-operating items: the former are recurrent in nature, \\nunlike the latter. Some groups consider productivity-enhancing restructuring charges as \\noperating items and business shutdowns as non-recurrent items. This may be acceptable \\nwhen the external analyst is able to verify the breakdown between these two categories. \\nOther companies tend to treat the entire restructuring charge as a non-recurrent item.'),\n",

Their maturity is generally between three and 10 years after their issuance. They are \\ngranted free of charge to company employees, usually senior executives. Their purpose is \\nto motivate executives to manage the company as efficiently as possible, thereby increas-\\ning its value and delivering them a financial gain when they exercise the stock options. \\nAs we will see in Chapter 26, they represent one of the ways of aligning the interests of \\nmanagers with those of shareholders.\\n2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR ?\\nUnder IFRS, the issuance of fully vested stock options is presumed to relate to past ser-\\nvice, requiring the full amount of the grant-date fair value to be expensed immediately. \\nThe issuance of stock options to employees with, say, a four-year vesting period21 is \\n20 Small- and \\nmedium-sized\\nenterprises.\\n21Which means \\nthat stock options \\ncannot be exer-\\ncised for at least \\nfour years.'),\n",

Therefore, the fair value of the \\nshare-based payment, determined at the grant date, should be expensed on the income \\nstatements over the vesting period. The corresponding entry is an increase in equity for \\nthe same amount.\\nStock options are usually valued using standard option-pricing models 22 with some \\nalterations or discounts to take into account cancellations of stock options during the \\nvesting period (some holders may resign), and conditions which may be attached to their \\nexercise such as the share price reaching a minimum threshold or outperforming an index.\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nDo stock options and free shares make pre-existing shareholders poorer? Yes, because \\nthe eventual exercise of stock options and the granting of free shares mean that shares are \\nissued at a lower price than their value at the time. Of course, we could hope that granting \\nthem would lead to higher motivation and greater loyalty on the part of the company’s \\nstaff, which would at least make up for the dilution. But as much as this may be true, it is \\nvery difficult to measure the positive effects, and they may go hand in hand with the perni-\\ncious effects they can have on managers who get stock options e.g. retention of dividends \\nand bias in favour of the riskiest investments and debt (and that doesn’t even include \\naccounting manipulation, which is another story).\\nCan we say that the company gets poorer by the amount of the stock options granted \\nfreely? No, it is the shareholders who potentially get poorer while the recipients of these \\ninstruments benefit, not the company, whose assets and debts are still worth what they \\nwere.\\nConceptually, an accounting charge is an item which increases the amount of a liabil-\\nity due, which reduces the value of an asset or which sooner or later results in cash being \\npaid out. But here, this is not the case. The granting of stock options/free shares does not \\nlead to any flows for the company if they are not exercised, or to new equity if they are. In \\na nutshell, a charge may lead to bankruptcy since sooner or later it generates a reduction \\nin assets or an increase in debts. Granting stock options, on the other hand, strengthens \\nthe solvency of the company (and the granting of free shares certainly does not weaken \\nit). How then can the granting of stock options or free shares be booked as a charge? For \\nus, this just doesn’t make sense. \\nWe recommend, in terms of valuation, to deduct the value of stock options from the \\nvalue of capital employed in order to obtain the value of equity, without modifying the \\nnumber of shares issued. \\nAlternatively, we can reason in fully diluted terms, as if all of the options granted \\nthat are in the money were exercised and that the funds collected were used to buy back \\nexisting shares at their current value (treasury method, described in Section 22.5), or to \\npay back a part of the debt or increase available cash (funds placement method, described \\nin Section 22.5). The number of shares will obviously be adjusted as a consequence.  \\nOptions that are out of the money must receive the same treatment after having multiplied \\ntheir quantity by their delta, which measures the probability that they will end their lives \\nin the money.\\n22 For more, see \\nChapter 23.'),\n",

The fair value option then has to be taken \\nfor a whole category of assets (e.g. real estate). This option is not widely used by compa-\\nnies (in particular because the annual measurement of fair values and booking of changes \\nin fair value is complex)24 except:\\nt on first implementation of IFRS;\\nt following an acquisition where it is required for the tangible assets of the purchased \\ncompany.25\\nSome tangible assets may be very substantial; they may have increased in value (e.g. \\na head office, a store, a plant located in an urban centre) and thus become much more \\nvaluable than their historical costs suggest. Conversely, some tangible assets have virtu-\\nally no value outside the company’s operations. Though it may be an exaggeration, we \\ncan say that they have no more value than certain start-up costs.\\nIt is clear that showing assets at historical cost, in line with the historical cost principle, \\ndoes not have any beneﬁts for the analyst from a ﬁnancial standpoint.\\nNote that certain companies also include interim financial expense into internally \\nor externally produced fixed assets (provided that this cost is clearly identified).

If \\nthey are sold by the company in the future, the disposal price will directly increase equity, \\nand no capital gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement.\\n3/ HOW SHOULD FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TREAT THEM ?\\nWhatever their original purpose, we recommend deducting treasury shares from assets \\nand from shareholders’ equity if this has not yet been done by the accountants. From \\na financial standpoint, we believe that share repurchases are equivalent to a capital \\nreduction, regardless of the legal treatment. Likewise, if the company sells the shares, we \\nrecommend that these sales be analysed as a capital increase.\\nTreasury shares must thus be subtracted from the number of shares outstanding when \\ncalculating earnings per share or valuing the equity.\\nTo better understand accounting rules:\\nB.

These documents \\ndescribe how the company’s economic and financial situation is translated by means \\nof a code (i.e. accounting) into tables of figures (accounts).\\nSince the aim of financial analysis is to portray a company’s economic reality by \\ngoing beyond just the figures, it is vital to think about what this reality is and how well \\nit is reflected by the figures before embarking on an analysis of the accounts. Otherwise, \\nthe resulting analysis may be sterile, overly descriptive and contain very little insight. It \\nwould not identify problems until they have shown up in the numbers, i.e. after they have \\noccurred and when it is too late for investors to sell their shares or reduce their credit \\nexposure.\\nOnce this preliminary task has been completed, readers can embark on the standard \\ncourse of financial analysis that we suggest and use more sophisticated tools, such as \\ncredit scoring and ratings.\\nBut first and foremost, we need to deal with the issue of what financial analysis \\nactually is.\\nSection 8.1\\nWHAT IS FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ?\\n1/ WHAT IS FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FOR ?\\nFinancial analysis is a tool used by existing and potential shareholders of a company, as \\nwell as lenders or rating agencies. For shareholders, financial analysis assesses whether '),\n",

It usually involves an analysis of the value of the \\nshare and ends with the formulation of a buy or a sell recommendation on the share. \\nFor lenders, financial analysis assesses the solvency and liquidity of a company, i.e. its \\nability to honour its commitments and repay its debts on time.\\nWe should emphasise, however, that there are not two different sets of processes de-\\npending on whether an assessment is being carried out for shareholders or lenders. Even \\nthough the purposes are different, the techniques used are the same for the very simple \\nreason that a value-creating company will be solvent and a value-destroying company \\nwill, sooner or later, face solvency problems. Both lenders and shareholders look very \\ncarefully at a company’s cash flow statement because it shows the company’s ability to re-\\npay debts to lenders and to generate free cash flows, the key value driver for shareholders.\\n2/ FINANCIAL ANALYSIS IS MORE OF A PRACTICE THAN A THEORY\\nThe purpose of financial analysis, which primarily involves dealing with economic and \\naccounting data, is to provide insight into the reality of a company’s situation on the basis \\nof figures. Naturally, knowledge of an economic sector and a company and, more simply, \\nsome common sense may easily replace some financial analysis techniques. Very precise \\nconclusions may be made without sophisticated analytical techniques.\\nFinancial analysis should be regarded as a rigorous approach to the issues faced by a \\nbusiness that helps rationalise the study of economic and accounting data.\\nThe financial analyst is heavily dependent on accounting figures which do not sys-\\ntematically give an appropriate view of the economic and financial reality of a company. \\nConsequently, from time to time, he has to adjust some elements of the published ac-\\ncounts to make them more relevant and easier to interpret.\\n3/ IT REPRESENTS A RESOLUTELY GLOBAL VISION OF THE COMPANY\\nIt is worth noting that although financial analysis carried out internally within a company \\nand externally by an outside observer is based on different information, the logic behind \\nit is the same in both cases. Financial analysis is intended to provide a global assessment \\nof the company’s current and future position.\\nWhether carrying out an internal or external analysis, an analyst should seek to study \\nthe company primarily from the standpoint of an outsider looking to achieve a compre-\\nhensive assessment of abstract data, such as the company’s strategy and its results .\\nFundamentally, financial analysis is a method that helps to describe the company in broad \\nterms on the basis of a few key points.\\nFrom a practical standpoint, the analyst has to match the policies adopted by the \\ncompany and its real situation. Therefore, analysts’ effectiveness is not measured by their \\nuse of sophisticated techniques but by their ability to uncover evidence of the inaccuracy \\nof the accounting data or of serious problems being concealed. As an example, a com-\\npany’s earnings power may be maintained artificially through a revaluation or through '),\n",

In such \\ncircumstances, competent analysts will cast doubt on the company’s earnings power and \\ntrack down the root cause of the deterioration in profitability.\\nWe frequently see that external analysts are able to piece together the global econom-\\nic model of a company and place it in the context of its main competitors. By analysing \\na company’s economic model over the medium term, analysts are able to detect chronic \\nweaknesses and separate them from temporary glitches. For instance, an isolated incident \\nmay be attributable to a precise and non-recurring factor, whereas a string of incidents \\ncaused by different factors will prompt an external analyst to look for more fundamental \\nproblems likely to affect the company as a whole.\\nNaturally, it is impossible to appreciate the finer points of financial analysis with-\\nout grasping the fact that a set of accounts represents a compromise between different \\nconcerns. Let’s consider, for instance, a company that is highly profitable because it has \\na very efficient operating structure, but also posts a non-recurrent profit. We see a slight \\ndeterioration in its operating ratios. In our view, it is important not to make hasty judge-\\nments. The company probably attempted to adjust the size of the exceptional gain by \\nbeing very strict in the way that it accounts for operating revenues and costs.\\nSection 8.2\\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF COMPANIES\\nAn economic analysis of a company does not require cutting-edge expertise in industrial \\neconomics or encyclopedic knowledge of economic sectors. Instead, it entails straightfor-\\nward reasoning and a good deal of common sense, with an emphasis on:\\nr\\x01analysing the company’s market and its position within its market;\\nr\\x01 studying its production model;\\nr\\x01 analysing its distribution networks;\\nr\\x01 and, lastly, identifying what motivates the company’s key people.\\n1/ ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY ’S MARKET\\nUnderstanding the company’s market generally leads analysts to reach conclusions that \\nare important for the analysis of the company as a whole.\\n(a)What is a market?\\nFirst of all, a market is not an economic sector as statistics institutes, central banks \\nor professional associations would define it. Markets and economic sectors are two \\ncompletely separate concepts.'),\n",

It is the entertainment market, not just the TV market. Competition comes from \\ncinema multiplexes, DVDs and live sporting events rather than from ITV , RTL TV , Rai \\nUno or TF1, which mainly sell advertising slots to advertisers seeking to target the leg-\\nendary housewife below 50 years of age.\\nSo what is a market? A market is defined by consistent behaviour, e.g. a product \\nsatisfying similar needs, purchased through a similar distribution network by the same \\ncustomers.\\nA market is not the same as an economic sector. Rather, it is a niche or space in which \\na business has some industrial, commercial or service-oriented expertise. It is the arena \\nin which it competes.\\nOnce a market has been defined, it can then be segmented using geographical (i.e. \\nlocal, regional, national, worldwide) and sociological (luxury, mid-range, entry-level \\nproducts) variables. This is also an obvious tactic adopted by companies seeking to gain \\nprotection from their rivals. If such a tactic succeeds, a company will create its own mar-\\nket in which it reigns supreme. Apple, with its iPad, has created a product that is neither a \\nPDA nor a computer but a unique product. But before readers get carried away and rush \\noff to create their very own markets arenas, it should be remembered that a market always \\ncomes under threat sooner or later, think about the BlackBerry and smartphones.\\nSegmenting markets is never a problem for analysts, but it is vital to get the segmen-\\ntation right! To say that a manufacturer of running shoes has a 30% share of the German \\nrunning shoe market may be correct from a statistical standpoint but is totally irrelevant \\nfrom an economic standpoint, because this is a worldwide market with global brands \\nbacked by marketing campaigns featuring international champions. Conversely, a 40% \\nshare of the northern Swiss cement market is a meaningful number, because cement is \\na heavy product with a low unit value that cannot be stored for long and is not usually \\ntransported more than 150–200 km from the cement plants.\\n(b)Market growth\\nOnce a financial analyst has studied and defined a market, his natural reflex is then to \\nattempt to assess the growth opportunities and identify the risk factors. The simplest form \\nof growth is organic volume growth, i.e. selling more and more products.\\nThat said, it is worth noting that volume growth is not always as easy as it may sound \\nin developed countries given weak demographic growth (e.g. between −0.5% and +1%\\np.a. in Europe). Booming markets do exist (flatscreen TV sets), but others are rapidly con-\\ntracting (nuclear power stations, daily newspapers) or are cyclical (transportation, paper \\nproduction).\\nAt the end of the day, in mature countries, the most important type of growth is \\nvalue growth. Let’s imagine that we sell a product satisfying a basic need, such as bread. \\nDemand does not grow much and, if anything, appears to be declining. So we attempt to \\nmove upmarket by means of either marketing or packaging, or by innovating. As a result, \\nwe decide to switch from selling bread to providing a whole range of speciality products, \\nsuch as baguettes, rye bread and farmhouse loaves, and we start charging €1.10 or even \\n€1.30, rather than €0.90 per item. The risk of pursuing this strategy is that our rivals may '),\n",

The famous 17th century letter writer Mme de Sévigné once \\nforecast that coffee was just a fad and would not last for more than a week. At the other \\nend of the spectrum, it is not uncommon to hear entrepreneurs claiming that their products \\nwill revolutionise consumers’ lifestyles and even outlast the wheel!\\nTo tackle the \\nquestion of \\nmarket growth, \\nwe need to look \\nat the product \\nlifecycle.\\nGrowth drivers in a developed economy are often highly complex. They may include:\\nr\\x01 technological advances, new products (e.g. TV on mobile phones);\\nr\\x01 changes in the economic situation (e.g. expansion of air travel with the rise in living \\nstandards);\\nr\\x01 changes in consumer lifestyles (e.g. eating out);\\nr\\x01 changing fashions (e.g. snowboards, catamarans);\\nr\\x01 demographic trends (e.g. popularity of cruises owing to the ageing of the population);\\nr\\x01 environmental considerations (e.g. electric cars);\\nr\\x01 delayed uptake of a product (e.g. mobile banking in Africa where the retail banking \\nnetwork was limited).\\nIn its early days, the market evolves rapidly, as products are still poorly geared to \\nconsumers’ needs. During the growth phase, the technological risk has disappeared, the \\nmarket has become established and expands rapidly, being fairly insensitive to fluctua-\\ntions in the economy at large. As the market reaches maturity, sales become sensitive to \\nups and downs in general economic conditions. And as the market ages and goes into \\ndecline, price competition increases, and certain market participants fall by the wayside. \\nThose that remain may be able to post very attractive margins, and no more investment \\nis required.\\nLaunch Growth Maturity\\nProduct life cycle\\nDecline\\nSALES\\nPROFITS\\nTime'),\n",

Where future growth has been over-estimated, supply \\nexceeds demand, even when growth is strong, and all market participants lose money \\n(e.g. the solar panel industry). For instance, after a false start in the 1980s (when the \\nleading player Atari went bankrupt), the video games sector has experienced growth \\nrates of well over 20%, but returns on capital employed of most companies in this sec-\\ntor are, at best, poor. Conversely, tobacco, which is one of the most mature markets in \\nexistence, generates a very high level of return on capital employed for the last few \\nremaining companies operating in the sector.\\n(c)Market risk\\nMarket risk varies according to whether the product in question is original equipment or a \\nreplacement item. A product sold as original equipment will seem more compelling in the \\neyes of consumers who do not already possess it. And it is the role of advertising to make \\nsure this is how they feel. Conversely, should consumers already own a product, they will \\nalways be tempted to delay replacing it until their conditions improve and thus will spend \\ntheir limited funds on another new product. Needs come first! Put another way, replace-\\nment products are much more sensitive to general economic conditions than original equip-\\nment. For instance, sales in the European truck industry beat all existing records in 2007 \\nwhen the economy was in excellent shape, but sales slumped to new lows in 2009 when the \\nrecession kicked in. Sales picked up again in 2010–2011 only to fall again in 2012.\\nWith this in mind, it is vital for an analyst to establish whether a company’s products \\nare acquired as original equipment or as part of a replacement cycle because this directly \\naffects the company’s sensitivity to general economic conditions.\\nAll too often we have heard analysts claim that a particular sector, such as the food \\nindustry, does not carry any risk (because we will always need to eat!). These analysts \\neither cannot see the risks or they disregard them. Granted, we will always need to eat and \\ndrink, but not necessarily in the same way. For instance, eating out is on the increase, soda \\nconsumption is declining and consumption of fresh fruit juice is growing fast.\\nRisk also depends on the nature of barriers to entry to the company’s market and \\nwhether or not alternative products exist. Nowadays barriers to entry tend to weaken \\nconstantly owing to:\\nr\\x01a powerful worldwide trend towards deregulation (there are fewer and fewer monop-\\nolies, e.g. in railways and postal services);\\nr\\x01 technological advances (and in particular the Internet);\\nr\\x01 a strong trend towards internationalisation.\\nAll these factors have increased the number of potential competitors and made the \\nbarriers to entry erected by existing players far less sturdy.\\nFor instance, the five record industry majors – Sony, Bertelsmann, Universal, Warner \\nand EMI – had achieved worldwide domination of their market, with a combined market \\nshare of 80%. Nevertheless, they have seen their grip loosened by the development of \\nthe Internet and artists’ ability to sell their products directly to consumers through music \\ndownloads – not to mention the impact of piracy!'),\n",

As a result, the company reduces the volatility of its business;\\nr\\x01 a strong bargaining position vis-à-vis its customers and suppliers. Mass retailers are \\na perfect example of this;\\nr\\x01 an attractive position which means that any small producer wishing to put itself up \\nfor sale, any inventor of a new product or new technique or any talented new gradu-\\nate will usually come to see this market leader first, because a company with a large \\nmarket share is a force to be reckoned with in its market.\\nThat said, just because market share is quantifiable does not mean that the numbers \\nare always relevant. For instance, market share is meaningless in the construction and \\npublic works market (and indeed is never calculated). Customers in this sector do not \\nrenew their purchases on a regular basis (town halls, swimming pools and roads have a \\nlong useful life). Even if they do, contracts are awarded through a bidding process, mean-\\ning that there is no special link between customers and suppliers. Likewise, building up \\nmarket share by slashing prices without being able to hold onto the market share accu-\\nmulated after prices are raised again is pointless. This inability demonstrates the second \\nlimit on the importance of market share: the acquisition of market share must create value, \\notherwise it serves no purpose.\\nLastly, market share is not the same as size. For instance, a large share of a small \\nmarket is far more valuable than middling sales in a vast market.\\n(e) The competition\\nIf the market is expanding, it is better to have smaller rivals than several large ones with \\nthe financial and marketing clout to cream off all the market’s expansion. Where possible, \\nit is best not to try to compete against the likes of Google. Conversely, if the market has \\nreached maturity, it is better for the few remaining companies which have specialised in \\nparticular niches to be faced with large rivals that will not take the risk of attacking them \\nbecause the potential gains would be too small. Conversely, a stable market with a large \\nnumber of small rivals frequently degenerates into a price war that drives some players out \\nof business.\\nBut since a company cannot choose its rivals, it is important to understand what \\ndrives them. Some rivals may be pursuing power or scale-related targets (e.g. biggest \\nturnover in the industry) that are frequently far from profitability targets. Consequently, \\nit is very hard for groups pursuing profitability targets to grow in such conditions. So \\nhow can a company achieve profitability when its main rivals, e.g. farming cooperatives \\nin the canned vegetables sector, are not profit-driven? It is very hard indeed because it \\nwill struggle to develop since it will generate weak profits and thus have few resources at \\nits disposal.'),\n",

Consequently, costs need to be kept under tight control \\nso that products are manufactured as cheaply as possible, product lines need to be \\nstreamlined to maximise economies of scale and the production process needs to be \\nautomated as far as possible. Market share is a key success factor since higher sales \\nvolumes help keep down unit costs (see Boston Consulting Group’s famous experi-\\nence curve which shows that unit costs fall by 20% when total production volumes \\ndouble in size). This is where engineers and financial controllers are most at home! It \\napplies to markets such as petrol, milk, phone calls, and so on.\\nr\\x01 Where competition is product-driven, customers make purchases based on after-sales \\nservice, quality, image, etc., which are not necessarily price-related. Therefore, com-\\npanies attempt to set themselves apart from their rivals and pay close attention to \\ntheir sales and customer loyalty techniques. This is where the marketing specialists \\nare in demand! Think about Nespresso’s quality of product and service, Harrods’s \\natmosphere or, of course, Apple.\\nThe real world is never quite as simple, and competition is rarely only price- or \\nproduct-driven but is usually dominated by one or the other or may even be a combi-\\nnation of both, e.g. vitamin-enhanced milk, caller-display services for phone calls, bio \\nwine.\\n2/ PRODUCTION\\n(a) Value chain\\nA value chain comprises all the companies involved in the manufacturing process, from \\nthe raw materials to the end product. Depending on the exact circumstances, a value chain \\nmay encompass the processing of raw materials, R&D, secondary processing, trading \\nactivities, a third or fourth processing process, further trading and lastly the end dis-\\ntributor. Increasingly in our service-oriented society, grey matter is the raw material, and \\nprocessing is replaced by a series of services involving some degree of added value, with \\ndistribution retaining its role.\\nThe point of analysing a value chain is to understand the role played by the market \\nparticipants, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses. Naturally, in times of \\ncrisis, all participants in the value chain come under pressure. But some of them will \\nsuffer more than others, and some may even disappear altogether because they are struc-\\nturally in a weak position within the value chain. Analysts need to determine where the \\nstructural weaknesses lie. They must be able to look beyond good performance when \\ntimes are good because it may conceal such weaknesses. Analysts’ ultimate goal is to \\nidentify where not to invest or not to lend within the value chain.\\nWhen studying a value chain, analysts need to identify weaknesses where a particular \\ncategory of player has no or very little room for manoeuvre (scope for developing new \\nlines of business for selling operating assets with value independent of their current \\nuse, etc.).'),\n",

Firstly, \\nmoney should not be invested in production facilities that are not yet stable and might \\neven have to be abandoned. Secondly, it is preferable to use the same funds to anchor \\nthe product more firmly in its market through technical innovation and marketing \\ncampaigns. Consequently, it may be wiser to outsource the production process and not \\nincur production-related risks on top of the product risk. Conversely, once the produc-\\ntion process has stabilised, it is in the company’s best interests to invest in securing a \\ntighter grip over the production process and unlocking productivity gains that will lead \\nto lower costs.\\nMore and more, companies are looking to outsource their manufacturing or service \\noperations, thereby reducing their core expertise to project design and management. \\nRoughly speaking, companies in the past were geared mainly to production and had a \\nvertical organisation structure because value was concentrated in the production function. \\nNowadays, in a large number of sectors (telecoms equipment, computer production, etc.), \\nvalue lies primarily in the research, innovation and marketing functions.\\nCompanies therefore have to be able to organise and coordinate production car-\\nried out externally. This outsourcing trend has given rise to companies such as Foxconn, \\nSolectron, and Flextronics, whose sole expertise is industrial manufacturing and who are \\nable to secure low costs and prices by leveraging economies of scale because they pro-\\nduce items on behalf of several competing groups.\\n3/ DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS\\nA distribution system usually plays three roles:\\nr\\x01logistics: displaying, delivering and storing products;\\nr\\x01 advice and services: providing details about and promoting the product, providing \\nafter-sales service and circulating information between the producer and consumers, \\nand vice versa;\\nr\\x01 financing: making firm purchases of the product, i.e. assuming the risk of poor sales.\\nThese three roles are vital, and where the distribution system does not fulfil them \\nor does so only partially, the producer will find itself in a very difficult position and will \\nstruggle to expand.\\nLet’s consider the example of the retail furniture sector. It does not perform the fi-\\nnancing role because it does not carry any inventory aside from a few demonstration \\nitems. The logistics side merely entails displaying items, and advice is limited, to say the \\nleast. As a result, the role of furniture producers is merely that of piece-workers who are \\nunable to build their own brand (a proof of their weakness), the only well-known brands \\nbeing private-label brands such as IKEA.\\nIt is easy to say that producers and distributors have diverging interests, but this is not \\ntrue. Their overriding goal is the same, i.e. that consumers buy the product. Inevitably, \\nproducers and distributors squabble over their respective share of the selling price, but \\nthat is a secondary issue. A producer will never be efficient if the distribution network \\nis inefficient.'),\n",

Naturally, this is a \\nkey decision for companies. The closer they can get to their end customers, possibly even \\nhandling the distribution role themselves, the faster and more accurately they will find \\nout what their customers want (pricing, product ranges, innovation, etc.). And the earlier \\nthey become aware of fluctuations in trading conditions, the sooner they will be able to \\nadjust their output. But such choice requires special human skills, investment in logistics \\nand sales facilities and substantial working capital.\\nThis approach makes more sense where the key factor motivating customer purchas-\\nes is not pricing but the product’s image, after-sales service and quality, which must be \\ntightly controlled by the company itself rather than an external player. For instance, in \\nrecent years Burberry has initiated a strategy to buy back the franchises and licences on \\nits trademark it had set up in certain countries.\\nBeing far from end customers carries with it the opposite pros and cons. The requisite \\ninvestment is minimal, but the company is less aware of its customers’ preferences, and \\nthe risks associated with cyclical ups and downs are amplified. If end customers slow \\ndown their purchases, it may take some time before the end retailer becomes aware of the \\ntrend and reduces its purchases from the wholesaler. The wholesaler will, in turn, suffer \\nfrom an inertia effect before scaling down its purchases from the producer, who will not \\ntherefore have been made aware of the slowdown until several weeks or even months after \\nit started. And when conditions pick up again, it is not unusual for distributors to run out \\nof stock even though the producer still has vast inventories.\\nWhere price competition predominates, it is better for the producer to focus its in-\\nvestment on production facilities to lower its costs, rather than to spread it thinly across \\na distribution network that requires different expertise from the production side. In this \\nregard, the Internet can be a cost-effective means of distribution.\\n4/ THE COMPANY AND ITS PEOPLE\\nAll too often, we have heard it said that a company’s human resources are what really \\ncount. In certain cases, this is used to justify all kinds of strange decisions. There may be \\nsome truth to it in smaller companies, which do not have strategic positions and survive \\nthanks to the personal qualities and charisma of their managers. Such a situation repre-\\nsents a major source of uncertainty for lenders and shareholders. To say that the men and \\nwomen employed by a company are important may well be true, but management will \\nstill have to establish strategic positions and build up economic rents1 that give some value \\nto the company aside from its founder or manager.\\n(a)Shareholders\\nFrom a purely financial standpoint, the most important men and women of a company are \\nits shareholders. They appoint its executives and determine its strategy. It is important to \\nknow who they are and what their aims are, as we will see in Chapter 41. There are two \\ntypes of shareholder, namely inside and outside shareholders.\\n1 i.e. earn a \\nrate of return \\nhigher than justi-\\nfied by risk. \\nSee Chapter 26.'),\n",

This fosters strong attachment to the company \\nand sometimes leads to the pursuit of scale-, power- and prestige-related objectives that \\nmay have very little to do with financial targets. Outside shareholders do not work with-\\nin the company and behave in a purely financial manner.\\nWhat sets inside shareholders apart is that they assume substantial personal risks \\nbecause both their assets and income are dependent on the same source, i.e. the company. \\nConsequently, inside shareholders usually pay closer attention than a manager who is not \\na shareholder and whose wealth is only partly tied up in the company. Nonetheless, the \\ndanger is that inside shareholders may not take the right decisions, e.g. to shut down a \\nunit, dispose of a business or discontinue an unsuccessful diversification venture, owing \\nto emotional ties or out of obstinacy. The Kirch Group would probably have fared better \\nduring the early 2000s had the group’s founder not clung on to his position as CEO well \\ninto retirement age and had groomed a successor.\\nOutside shareholders have a natural advantage. Because their behaviour is guided \\npurely by financial criteria, they will serve as a very useful touchstone for the group’s \\nstrategy and financial policy. That said, if the company runs into problems, they may act \\nvery passively and show a lack of resolve that will not help managers very much.\\nAnalysts should watch out for conflicts among shareholders that may paralyse the \\nnormal life of the company. As an example, disputes among the founding family members \\nalmost ruined Gucci.\\n(b)Managers\\nIt is important to understand the managers’ objectives and attitude vis-à-vis shareholders. \\nThe reader needs to bear in mind that the widespread development of share-option-based \\nincentive systems in particular has aligned the managers’ financial interests with those of \\nshareholders. We will examine this topic in greater depth in Chapter 26.\\nWe would advise readers to be very cautious where incentive systems have been \\nextended to include the majority of a company’s employees. Firstly, stock options can-\\nnot yet be used to buy food or pay rents and so salaries must remain the main source of \\nincome for unskilled employees. Secondly, should a company’s position start to dete-\\nriorate, its top talent will be fairly quick to jump ship after having exercised their stock \\noptions before they become worthless. Those that remain on board may fail to grasp what \\nis happening until it is too late, thereby losing precious time. This is what happened to \\nso-called new economy companies, which distributed stock options as a standard form of \\nremuneration. It is an ideal system when everything is going well, but highly dangerous \\nin the event of a crisis because it exacerbates the company’s difficulties.\\n(c) Corporate culture\\nCorporate culture is probably very difficult for an outside observer to assess. Nonethe-\\nless, it represents a key factor, particularly when a company embarks on acquisitions \\nor diversification ventures. A monolithic and highly centralised company with specific \\nexpertise in a limited number of products will struggle to diversify its businesses because \\nit will probably seek to apply the same methods to its target, thereby disrupting the latter’s \\nimpetus.'),\n",

In such circumstances, we can only advise the lender \\nnot to lend or to dispose of its loans as soon as possible and the shareholder not to buy \\nshares or to sell any already held as soon as possible. A company that adopts accounting \\nprinciples that deviate from the usual standards does not do so by chance. In all likelihood \\nthe company will be seeking to window-dress a fairly grim reality.\\nSection 8.4\\nSTANDARD FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PLAN\\nExperience has taught us that novices are often disconcerted when faced with the task \\nof carrying out their first financial analysis because they do not know where to start and \\nwhat to aim for. They risk producing a collection of mainly descriptive comments with-\\nout connecting them or verifying their internal consistency, i.e. without establishing any \\ncausal links.\\nA financial analysis is an investigation that must be carried out in a logical order. It \\ncomprises parts that are interlinked and should not therefore be carried out in isolation. \\nFinancial analysts are detectives, constantly on the lookout for clues, seeking to establish \\na logical sequence, as well as looking for any disruptive factor that may be a prelude to \\nproblems in the future. The questions they most often need to ask are “Is this logical? Is \\nthis consistent with what I have already found? If so, why? If not, why not?”\\nWe suggest that readers remember the following sentence, which can be used as the \\nbasis for all types of financial analysis:\\nWealth creation requires investment that must be ﬁnanced and provide sufﬁcient return.\\nLet us analyse this sentence in more depth. A company will be able to remain viable \\nand ultimately survive only if it manages to find customers ready to buy its goods or \\nservices in the long term at a price that enables it to post a sufficient operating profit. \\nThis forms the base for everything else.

But the company needs to make capital expenditures \\nto start operations: acquiring equipment, buildings, patents, subsidiaries, etc. (which are \\nfixed assets) and setting aside amounts to cover working capital. Fixed assets and working \\ncapital jointly form its capital employed. Naturally, these outlays will have to be financed \\neither through equity or bank loans and other borrowings.\\nOnce these three factors (margins, capital employed and financing) have been examined, \\nthe company’s profitability, i.e. its efficiency, can be calculated, in terms of either its return on \\ncapital employed (ROCE) or its return on equity (ROE). This marks the end of the analyst’s \\ntask and provides the answers to the original questions, i.e. Is the company able to honour \\nthe commitments it has made to its creditors? Is it able to create value for its shareholders?\\nConsequently, we have to study the company’s:\\nr\\x01 wealth creation, by focusing on:\\n○ trends in the company’s sales, including an analysis of both prices and volumes. \\nThis is a key variable that sets the backdrop for a financial analysis.

It \\nmay also be applied to projected financial statements prepared by the company. The only \\nway of teasing out trends is to look at performance over several years (usually at least \\nthree where the information is available).\\nAnalysts need to bring to light any possible deterioration so that they can seize on any \\nwarning signals pointing to major problems facing the company. All too often we have \\nseen lazy analysts look at the key profit indicators without bothering to take a step back \\nand analyse trends. Nonetheless, this approach has two important drawbacks:\\nr\\x01trend analysis only makes sense when the data are roughly comparable from one \\nyear to the next. This is not the case if the company’s business activities, business \\nmodel (e.g. massive use of outsourcing) or scope of consolidation change partially \\nor entirely, not to mention any changes in the accounting rules used to translate its \\neconomic reality;\\nr\\x01 accounting information is always published with a delay. Broadly speaking, the \\naccounts for a financial year are published between one and four months after the \\nyear end, and they may no longer bear any relation to the company’s present situa-\\ntion. In this respect, external analysts stand at a disadvantage to their internal counter-\\nparts who are able to obtain data much more rapidly if the company has an efficient \\ninformation system.\\n2/ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OR COMPARING SIMILAR COMPANIES\\nComparative analysis consists of evaluating a company’s key profit indicators and \\nratios so that they can be compared with the typical (median or average) indicators \\nand ratios of companies operating in the same sector of activity. The basic idea is that one \\nshould not get up to any more nonsense than one’s neighbours, particularly when it comes \\nto a company’s balance sheet. Why is that? Simply because during a recession most of \\nthe lame ducks will be eliminated and only healthy companies will be left standing. A\\ncompany is not viable or unviable in absolute terms. It is merely more or less viable \\nthan others.\\nThe comparative method is often used by financial analysts to compare the finan-\\ncial performance of companies operating in the same sector, by certain companies to set \\ncustomer payment periods, by banks to assess the abnormal nature of certain payment \\nperiods and of certain inventory turnover rates, and by those examining a company’s \\nfinancial structure. It may be used systematically by drawing on the research published \\nby organisations (such as central banks, Datastream, Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, etc.) '),\n",

They pub-\\nlish the main financial characteristics, in a standardised format, of companies operating \\nin different sectors of activity, as well as the norm (median or average) for each indicator \\nor ratio in each sector. This is the realm of benchmarking.\\nThis approach has two drawbacks:\\nr\\x01 The concept of sector is a vague one and depends on the level of detail applied. This \\napproach analyses a company based on rival firms, so to be of any value, the informa-\\ntion compiled from the various companies in the sector must be consistent, and the \\nsample must be sufficiently representative.\\nr\\x01 There may be cases of mass delusion, leading to all the stocks in a particular sec-\\ntor being temporarily overvalued. Financial investors should then withdraw from \\nthe sector.\\n3/ NORMATIVE ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL RULES OF THUMB\\nNormative analysis represents an extension of comparative analysis. It is based on a com-\\nparison of certain company ratios or indicators with rules or standards derived from a vast \\nsample of companies.\\nFor instance, there are norms specific to certain industries:\\nr\\x01 in the hotel sector, the bed-per-night cost must be at least 1/1000 of the cost of build-\\ning the room, or the sales generated after three years should be at least one-third of \\nthe investment cost;\\nr\\x01 the level of work in progress relative to the company’s shareholders’ equity in the \\nconstruction sector;\\nr\\x01 the level of sales generated per square metre in supermarkets, etc.\\nThere are also some financial rules of thumb applicable to all companies regardless \\nof the sector in which they operate and relating to their balance sheet structure:\\nr\\x01fixed assets should be financed by stable sources of funds;\\nr\\x01 net debt should be no greater than around three times EBITDA;\\nReaders should be careful not to set too much store by these norms, which are often \\nnot very robust from a conceptual standpoint because they are determined from statisti-\\ncal studies. These ratios are hard to interpret, except perhaps where capital structure is \\nconcerned. After all, profitable companies can afford to do what they want, and some may \\nindeed appear to be acting rather whimsically, but profitability is what really matters. \\nLikewise, we will illustrate in Section IV of this book that there is no such thing as an \\nideal capital structure.\\nSection 8.6\\nRATINGS\\nCredit ratings are the result of a continuous assessment of a borrower’s solvency by \\na specialised agency (mainly Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch), by banks for '),\n",

As we shall see in Chapter 20, this assessment leads to the award \\nof a rating reflecting an opinion about the risk of a borrowing. The financial risk derives \\nboth from:\\nr\\x01the borrower’s ability to honour the stipulated payments; and\\nr\\x01 the specific characteristics of the borrowing, notably its guarantees and legal \\ncharacteristics.\\nThe rating is awarded at the end of a fairly lengthy process. Rating agencies assess \\nthe company’s strategic risks by analysing its market position within the sector (mar-\\nket share, industrial efficiency, size, quality of management, etc.) and by conducting a  \\nfinancial analysis.\\nThe main aspects considered include trends in the operating margin, trends and sus-\\ntainability of return on capital employed, analysis of capital structure (and notably cover-\\nage of financial expense by operating profit and coverage of net debt by cash generated by \\noperations or cash flow). We will deal with these ratios in more depth in Chapters 9 to 14.\\nLet us now deal with what may be described as “automated” financial analysis tech-\\nniques, which we will not return to again.\\nSection 8.7\\nSCORING  TECHNIQUES\\n1/ THE PRINCIPLES  OF  CREDIT  SCORING\\nCredit scoring is an analytical technique intended to carry out a pre-emptive check-up of \\na company.\\nThe basic idea is to prepare ratios from companies’ accounts that are leading indi-\\ncators (i.e. two or three years ahead) of potential difficulties. Once the ratios have been \\nestablished, they merely have to be calculated for a given company and cross-checked \\nagainst the values obtained for companies that are known to have run into problems or \\nhave failed. Comparisons are not made ratio by ratio, but globally. The ratios are com-\\nbined in a function known as the Z-score that yields a score for each company. The equa-\\ntion for calculating Z-scores is as follows:\\nZa R i\\ni1\\nn\\ni=+ ×\\n=\\n∑β\\nwhere a is a constant, Ri the ratios, βi the relative weighting applied to ratio Ri  and n the \\nnumber of ratios used.\\nDepending on whether a given company’s Z-score is close to or a long way off nor-\\nmative values based on a set of companies that ran into trouble, the company in question \\nis said to have a certain probability of experiencing trouble or remaining healthy over the '),\n",

Originally developed in the US during the late 1960s \\nby Edward Altman, the family of Z-scores has been highly popular, the latest version of \\nthe Z″ equation being:\\nZ″=  6.6X1 + 3.26X2 + 6.72X3 + 1.05X4\\nwhere X1 is working capital/total assets; X2 is retained earnings/total assets; X3 is operat-\\ning profit/total assets; X4 is shareholders’ equity/net debt.\\nIf Z″ is less than 1.1, the probability of corporate failure is high, and if Z″ is higher than \\n2.6, the probability of corporate failure is low, the grey area being values of between 1.1 \\nand 2.6. The Z″-score has not yet been replaced by the Zeta score, which introduces into the \\nequation the criteria of earnings stability, debt servicing and balance sheet liquidity.\\n2/ BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF SCORING TECHNIQUES\\nScoring techniques represent an enhancement of traditional ratio analysis, which is based \\non the isolated use of certain ratios. With scoring techniques, the problem of the relative \\nimportance to be attached to each ratio has been solved because each is weighted accord-\\ning to its ability to pick out the “bad” companies from the “good” ones.\\nThat said, scoring techniques still have a number of drawbacks.\\nSome weaknesses derive from the statistical underpinnings of the scoring equation. \\nThe sample needs to be sufficiently large, the database accurate and consistent and the \\nperiod considered sufficiently long to reveal trends in the behaviour of companies and to \\nmeasure its impact.\\nThe scoring equation has to be based on historical data from the fairly recent past \\nand thus needs to be updated over time. Can the same equation be used several years later \\nwhen the economic and financial environment in which companies operate may have \\nchanged considerably? It is thus vital for scoring equations to be kept up to date.\\nThe design of scoring equations is heavily influenced by their designers’ top priority, \\ni.e. to measure the risk of failure for small and medium-sized enterprises. They are not \\nwell suited for any other purpose (e.g. predicting in advance which companies will be \\nhighly profitable) or for measuring the risk of failure for large groups. Scoring equations \\nshould thus be used only for companies where the business activities and size are on a par \\nwith those in the original sample.\\nScoring techniques, which are a straightforward and rapid way of synthesising fig-\\nures, have considerable appeal. Their development may even have perverse self-fulfilling \\neffects. Prior awareness of the risk of failure (which scoring techniques aim to provide) \\nmay lead some of the companies’ business partners to adopt behaviour that hastens their \\ndemise. Suppliers may refuse to provide credit, banks may call in their loans, customers \\nmay be harder to come by because they are worried about not receiving delivery of the \\ngoods they buy or not being able to rely on after-sales service.\\nSection 8.8\\nEXPERT SYSTEMS\\nExpert systems are comprised of software developed to carry out financial analysis using \\na knowledge base consisting of rules of financial analysis, enriched with the result of each '),\n",

It is a key \\nstage because a company that does not manage to sell its products or services for more \\nthan the corresponding production costs is clearly doomed to fail. But, as we shall see, \\npositive margins are not sufficient on their own to create value or to escape bankruptcy.\\nNet income is what is left after all the revenues and charges shown on the income \\nstatement have been taken into account. Readers will not therefore be very surprised to \\nlearn that we will not spend too much time on analysing net income as such. A company’s \\nperformance depends primarily on its operating performance, which explains why recur-\\nring operating profit (or EBIT) is the focus of analysts’ attention. Financial and non-\\nrecurrent items are regarded as being almost “inevitable” or “automatic” and are thus less \\ninteresting, particularly when it comes to forecasting a company’s future prospects.\\nThe first step in margin analysis is to examine the accounting practices used by the \\ncompany to draw up its income statement. We dealt with this subject in Chapter 8 and \\nshall not restate it here, except to stress how important it is. Given the emphasis placed by \\nanalysts on studying operating profit, there is a big temptation for companies to present \\nan attractive recurring operating profit by transferring operating charges to financial or \\nnon-recurring items.\\nThe next stage involves a trend analysis based on an examination of the revenues and \\ncharges that determined the company’s operating performance. This is useful only insofar \\nas it sheds light on the past to help predict the future. Therefore, it is based on histori-\\ncal data and should cover several financial years. Naturally, this exercise is based on the \\nassumption that the company’s business activities have not altered significantly during the \\nperiod under consideration.\\nThe main aim here is to calculate the rate of change in the main sources of revenue and \\nthe main costs, to examine their respective trends and thus to account for the relative \\nchange in the margins posted by the company over the period.\\nThe main potential pitfall in this exercise is adopting a purely descriptive approach, with-\\nout much or any analytical input, e.g. statements such as “personnel cost increased by \\n10%, rising from 100 to 110 . . .”.'),\n",

Granted, analysts only have to \\npage through the notes to the accounts for the more detailed information they need to get \\nto grips with. In most cases, they will be able to work back towards EBITDA1 by using \\nthe depreciation and amortisation data that must be included in the notes or in the cash \\nflow statement.\\n1/ SALES\\nSales trends are an essential factor in all ﬁnancial analysis and company assessments. \\nCompanies for which business activities are expanding rapidly, stagnating, growing \\nslowly, turning lower or depressed will encounter different problems. Sales growth forms \\nthe cornerstone for all ﬁnancial analysis. Sales growth needs to be analysed in terms of \\nvolume (quantities sold) and price trends, organic and external growth (i.e. acquisition \\ndriven).\\nBefore sales volumes can be analysed, external growth needs to be separated from the \\ncompany’s organic growth, so that like can be compared with like. This means analysing \\n1 Earnings\\nbefore interest, \\ntaxes, depre-\\nciation and \\namortisation.'),\n",

In \\npractice, most groups publish pro forma accounts in the notes to their accounts showing \\nthe income statements for the relevant and previous periods based on the same scope of \\nconsolidation and using the same consolidation methods.\\nIf a company is experiencing very brisk growth, analysts will need to look closely at \\nthe growth in operating costs and the cash needs generated by this growth.\\nA company experiencing a period of stagnation will have to scale down its operat-\\ning costs and financial requirements. As we shall see later in this chapter, production \\nfactors do not have the same flexibility profile when sales are growing as when sales are \\ndeclining.\\nWhere a company sells a single product, volume growth can easily be calculated as \\nthe difference between the overall increase in sales and the selling price of its product. \\nWhere it sells a variety of different products or services, analysts face a trickier task. In \\nsuch circumstances, they have the option of either working along the same lines by study-\\ning the company’s main products or calculating an average price increase, based on which \\nthe average growth in volumes can be estimated.\\nAn analysis of price increases provides valuable insight into the extent to which \\noverall growth in sales is attributable to inflation. The analysis can be carried out by com-\\nparing trends in the company’s prices with those in the general price index for its sector \\nof activity. Account also needs to be taken of currency fluctuations and changes in the \\nproduct mix, which may sometimes significantly affect sales, especially in consolidated \\naccounts.\\nIn turn, this process helps to shed light on the company’s strategy, i.e.:\\nt whether its prices have increased through efforts to sell higher-value-added products;\\nt whether prices have been hiked owing to a lack of control on administrative over-\\nheads, which will gradually erode sales performance;\\nt whether the company has lowered its prices in a bid to pass on efficiency gains to \\ncustomers and thus to strengthen its market position;\\nt etc.\\nKey points and indicators:\\ntThe rate of growth in sales is the key indicator that needs to be analysed.\\nt It should be broken down into volume and price trends, as well as into product and \\nregional trends.\\nt These different rates of growth should then be compared with those for the market \\nat large and (general and sectoral) price indices. Currency effects should be taken \\ninto account.\\nt The impact of changes in the scope of consolidation on sales needs to be studied.\\n2/ PRODUCTION\\nSales represent what the company has been able to sell to its customers.

As a \\nresult, it is particularly important where the company carries high levels of inventories \\nor work in progress. Unfortunately, production is not entirely consistent insofar as it \\nlumps together:\\ntproduction sold (sales), shown at the selling price;\\nt changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress and production for own \\nuse, stated at cost price.\\nConsequently, production is primarily an accounting concept that depends on the methods \\nused to value the company’s inventories of finished goods and work in progress.\\nA faster rate of growth in production than in sales may be the result of serious \\nproblems:\\ntoverproduction, which the company will have to absorb in the following year by \\ncurbing its activities, bringing additional costs;\\nt overstatement of inventories’ value , which will gradually reduce the margins \\nposted by the company in future periods.\\nProduction for own use does not constitute a problem unless its size seems relatively \\nlarge. From a tax standpoint, it is good practice to maximise the amount of capital expen-\\nditure that can be expensed, in which case production for own use is kept to a minimum. \\nAn unusually high amount may conceal problems and an effort by management to boost \\nbook profit superficially.\\nKey points and indicators:\\ntThe growth rate in production and the production/sales ratio are the two key \\nindicators.\\nt They naturally require an analysis of production volumes and inventory valuation \\nmethods.\\n3/ GROSS MARGIN\\nGross margin is the difference between production and the cost of raw materials used. \\nProduction sold, i.e. sales\\n+ Changes in inventories of ﬁnished goods and work in progress at cost price\\n+ Production for own use, reﬂecting the work performed by the company for itself and \\ncarried at cost\\n= Production'),\n",

It is equivalent to the sum of gross trading profit and \\ngross margin used minus other goods and services purchased from third parties.\\nIt may thus be calculated as follows for by-nature income statements:\\nGross trading proﬁt\\n+ Gross margin\\n− Other operating costs purchased from third parties\\n= Value added\\nOther operating costs comprise outsourcing costs, property or equipment rental charges, \\nthe cost of raw materials and supplies that cannot be held in inventory (i.e. water, energy, \\nsmall items of equipment, maintenance-related items, administrative supplies, etc.), \\nmaintenance and repair work, insurance premiums, studies and research costs, fees pay-\\nable to intermediaries and professional costs, advertising costs, transportation charges, \\ntravel costs, the cost of meetings and receptions, postal charges and bank charges (not \\ninterest on bank loans, which is booked under interest expense).\\nFor by-function income statements, value added may be calculated as follows:\\nOperating proﬁt (EBIT)\\n+ Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on ﬁxed assets\\n+ Personnel costs\\n+ Tax other than corporate income tax\\n= Value added\\nAt company level, value added is of interest only insofar as it provides valuable insight \\nregarding the degree of a company’s integration within its sector. It is not uncommon \\nfor an analyst to say that average value added in sector X stands at A, as opposed to B in \\nsector Y .\\nBesides that, we do not regard the concept of value added as being very useful. In our \\nview, it is not very helpful to make a distinction between what a company adds to a prod-\\nuct or service internally and what it buys in from the outside. This is because all decisions \\nof a company are tailored to the various markets in which it operates, such as the markets \\nfor labour, raw materials, capital and capital goods, to cite but a few. Against this back-\\ndrop, a company formulates a specific value-creation strategy, i.e. a way of differentiating \\nits offering from that of its rivals in order to generate a revenue stream.'),\n",

In the food sector, food processing \\ncompanies usually establish special relationships with the farming industry. As a result, a \\ncompany with a workforce of 1000 may actually keep 10 000 farmers in work. This raises \\nthe issue of what such a company’s real value added is.\\nWhere a company has established special contractual ties with its supplier base, the \\nconcept of value added loses its meaning.\\nValue added is a useful concept only where a market-based relationship exists between \\na company and its suppliers.\\n6/ PERSONNEL  COST\\nThis is a very important item because it is often high in relative terms. Although personnel \\ncost is theoretically a variable cost, it actually represents a genuinely fixed-cost item from \\na short-term perspective.\\nA financial analysis should focus both on volume and price effects (measured by the\\npersonnel expense\\naverage headcount\\n ratio) as well as the employee productivity ratio, which is measured\\nby the following ratios: sales\\naverage headcount\\n , production\\naverage headcount\\n or value added\\naverage headcount\\n .\\nSince external analysts are unable to make more accurate calculations, they have to make \\na rough approximation of the actual situation. In general, productivity gains are limited \\nand are thinly spread across most income statement items, making them hard to isolate.\\nAnalysts should not neglect the inertia of personnel cost, as regards either increases or \\ndecreases in the headcount. If 100 additional staff members are hired throughout the year, \\nthis means that only 50% of their salary costs will appear in the first year, with the full \\namount showing up in the following period. The same applies if employees are laid off.\\nKey points and indicators:\\nPersonnel cost should be analysed in terms of:\\n t productivity – sales/average headcount, value added/average headcount and \\n production/average headcount;\\n t cost control – personnel cost/average headcount;\\n t growth.\\n7/ EARNINGS  BEFORE  INTEREST , TAXES , DEPRECIATION  AND  AMORTISATION  \\nAs we saw in Chapter 3, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amor-\\ntisation) is a key concept in the analysis of income statements. The concepts we have \\njust examined, i.e. value added and production, have more to do with macroeconomics, \\nwhereas EBITDA firmly belongs to the field of microeconomics.'),\n",

Consequently, it is computed as follows:\\nOperating proﬁt (EBIT)\\n+ Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on ﬁxed assets\\n= EBITDA\\nAlternatively, for by-nature income statements, EBITDA can be computed as follows:\\nOther operating costs comprise charges that are not used up as part of the production pro-\\ncess and include items such as redundancy payments, recurring restructuring charges, pay-\\nments relating to patents, licences, concessions, representation agreements and directors’ \\nfees. Other operating revenues include payments received in respect of patents, licences, \\nconcessions, representation agreements, directors’ fees, operating subsidies received.\\nImpairment losses on current assets include impairment losses related to receivables \\n(doubtful receivables), inventories, work in progress and various other receivables related \\nto the current or previous periods. Additions to provisions primarily include provisions \\nfor retirement benefit costs, litigation, major repairs and deferred costs, statutory leave, \\nredundancy or pre-redundancy payments, early retirement, future under-activity and relo-\\ncation,  provided that they relate to the company’s normal business activities. In fact, these \\nprovisions represent losses for the company and should be deducted from its EBITDA.\\nPersonnel expense and payroll charges also include employee incentive payments, \\nstock options and profit-sharing.\\nSince it is unaffected by non-cash charges – i.e. depreciation, amortisation, impair-\\nment charges and provisions, which may leave analysts rather blindsided – trends in the \\nEBITDA/sales ratio, commonly known as the EBITDA margin, form a central part of a \\nfinancial analysis.

It may thus be calcu-\\nlated as follows:\\nEBITDA\\n+ − Depreciation and amortisation\\n+ Write-backs of depreciation and amortisation\\n= Operating proﬁt or EBIT\\nImpairment losses on fixed assets relate to operating assets (brands, purchased goodwill, \\netc.) and are normally included with depreciation and amortisation by accountants. We \\nbeg to differ as impairment losses are normally non-recurring items and as such should \\nbe excluded by the analyst from the operating profit and relegated to the bottom of the \\nincome statement.\\nAs we saw in Chapter 3, the by-function format directly reaches operating profit \\nwithout passing through EBITDA:\\nSales\\n− Cost of sales\\n− Selling, general and administrative costs\\n− Research and development costs\\n+/− Other operating income and costs\\n= Operating proﬁt (or EBIT)\\nThe emphasis placed by analysts on operating performance has led many companies to \\nattempt to boost their operating profit artificially by excluding charges that should logi-\\ncally be included. These charges are usually to be found on the separate “Other income \\nand costs” line, below operating profit, and are, of course, normally negative.\\nOther companies publish an operating profit figure and a separate EBIT figure, pre-\\nsented as being more significant than operating profit. Naturally, it is always higher, too. \\nFor instance, we have seen foreign currency losses of a debt-free company, 2 recur-\\nring provisions for length-of-service awards and environmental liabilities, costs related to \\nunder-activity and anticipated losses on contracts excluded from operating profit. In other \\ncases, capital gains on asset disposals have been included in recurring EBIT.\\nWe believe it is vital for readers to avoid preconceptions and to analyse precisely what \\nis included and what is not included in operating proﬁt. In our opinion, the broader the \\noperating proﬁt deﬁnition, the better!\\n2 Which are \\nnecessarily\\nrelated to the \\noperating process \\nand not the \\nfinancing process \\nas the company \\nis debt-free.'),\n",

Where \\nfinancial income is greater than financial expense, we naturally refer to it as net financial \\nincome.\\nFinancial income includes:\\nt income from securities and from loans recorded as long-term investments (fixed \\nassets). This covers all income received from investments other than participating \\ninterests, i.e. dividends and interest on loans;\\nt other interests and related income, i.e. income from commercial and other loans, \\nincome from marketable securities, other financial income;\\nt write-backs of certain provisions and charges transferred, i.e. write-backs of provi-\\nsions, of impairment losses on financial items and, lastly, write-backs of financial \\ncharges transferred;\\nt foreign exchange gains on debt;\\nt net income on the disposal of marketable securities, i.e. capital gains.\\nFinancial expense includes:\\nt interest and related charges;\\nt foreign exchange losses on debt;\\nt net expense on the disposal of marketable securities, i.e. capital losses on the disposal \\nof marketable securities;\\nt amortisation of bond redemption premiums;\\nt additions to provisions for financial liabilities and charges and impairment losses on \\ninvestments.\\nWhere a company uses sophisticated ﬁnancial liabilities and treasury management tech-\\nniques, we advise readers to analyse its net ﬁnancial income/expense carefully.\\nNet financial expense is not directly related to the operating cycle, but instead reflects \\nthe size of the company’s debt burden and the level of interest rates. There is no volume or \\nprice effect to be seen at this level. Chapter 12, which is devoted to the issue of how com-\\npanies are financed, covers the analysis of net financial expense in much greater detail.\\nProfit before tax is the difference between operating profit and financial expense net \\nof financial income.\\n2/ NON-RECURRING ITEMS\\nDepending on accounting principles, firms are allowed to include more or fewer items in \\nthe exceptional/extraordinary items line. The International Accounting Standards Board \\n(IASB) has decided to include extraordinary and exceptional items within operating with-\\nout identifying them as such. Nevertheless, the real need for such a distinction has led a \\nlarge number of companies reporting in IFRS to present a “recurring operating profit” (or \\nsimilar term) before the operating profit line.\\nNon-recurring items should be defined on a case-by-case basis by the analyst.

If it is recurrent, it \\nwill occur again and again in the future. If it is not recurrent, it is simply a one-off item.\\nWithout any doubt, extraordinary items and results from discontinued operations are \\nnon-recurrent items.\\nExceptional items are much more tricky to analyse. In large groups, closure of plants, \\nprovisions for restructuring, etc. tend to happen every year in different divisions or coun-\\ntries and should consequently be treated as recurring items. In some sectors, exceptional \\nitems are an intrinsic part of the business. A car rental company renews its fleet of cars \\nevery nine months and regularly registers capital gains. Exceptional items should then be \\nanalysed as recurrent items and as such be included in the operating profit. For smaller \\ncompanies, exceptional items tend to be one-off items and as such should be seen as non-\\nrecurrent items.\\nIt makes no sense to assess the current level of non-recurring items from the perspec-\\ntive of the company’s profitability or to predict their future trends. Analysts should limit \\nthemselves to understanding their origin and why, for example, the company needed to \\nwrite down the goodwill.\\n3/ INCOME TAX\\nThe corporate income tax line can be difficult to analyse owing to the effects of deferred \\ntaxation, the impact of foreign subsidiaries and tax-loss carryforwards. Analysts usually \\ncalculate the group’s effective tax rate (i.e. corporate income tax divided by profit before \\ntax), which they monitor over time to assess how well the company has managed its tax \\naffairs. A weak tax rate must be explained. It may be due to the use of tax losses car-\\nried forward or to aggressive tax optimization schemes which are not risk-free especially \\nwhen countries are running high levels of debts and/or deficits.\\nIn the notes to the accounts, there is a table that explains the reconciliation between \\nthe theoretical tax rate on companies and the tax rate effectively paid by the company or \\nthe group (it is called “tax proof”).\\n4/ GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT , INCOME FROM ASSOCIATES , MINORITY INTERESTS\\nRegarding goodwill impairment, the main questions should be: Where does this goodwill \\ncome from and why was it depreciated?\\nDepending on its size, the share of net profits (losses) of associates3 deserves special \\nattention. Where these profits or losses account for a significant part of net income, either \\nthey should be separated out into operating, financial and non-recurring items to provide \\ngreater insight into the contribution made by the equity-accounted associates, or a sepa-\\nrate financial analysis should be carried out of the relevant associate.\\nMinority interests4 are always an interesting subject and beg the following questions: \\nWhere do they come from? Which subsidiaries do they relate to? Do the minority inves-\\ntors finance losses or do they grab a large share of the profits? An analysis of minority \\ninterests often proves to be a useful way of working out which subsidiary(ies) generate(s) \\nthe group’s profits.\\n3 For more on \\nassociates, see \\npage 75.\\n4For more on \\nminority interest, \\nsee page 73.'),\n",

This is what is known as the \\nscissors effect.\\nWhether or not a scissors effect is identified matters little. What really counts is \\nestablishing the causes of the phenomenon. A scissors effect may occur for all kinds of \\nreasons (regulatory developments, intense competition, mismanagement in a sector, etc.) \\nthat reflect the higher or lower quality of the company’s strategic position in its \\nmarket. If it has a strong position, it will be able to pass on any increase in its costs to its \\ncustomers by raising its selling prices and thus gradually widening its margins.\\nWhere it reduces profits, the scissors effect may be attributable to:\\nt a statutory freeze on selling prices, making it impossible to pass on the rising cost of \\nproduction factors;\\nt psychological reluctance to put up prices. During the 1970s, the impact of higher \\ninterest rates was very slow to be reflected in selling prices in certain debt-laden \\nsectors;\\nt poor cost control, e.g. where a company does not have a tight grip on its cost base \\nand may not be able to pass rising costs on in full to its selling prices. As a result, the \\ncompany no longer grows, but its cost base continues to expand.\\nThe impact of trends in the cost of production factors is especially important because \\nthese factors represent a key component of the cost price of products. In such cases, \\nanalysts have to try to estimate the likely impact of a delayed adjustment in prices. This \\ndepends primarily on how the company and its rivals behave and on their relative strength \\nwithin the marketplace.\\nBut the scissors effect may also work to the company’s benefit, as shown by the last \\ntwo charts in the following figure.\\n2/ Pitfalls\\nA company’s accounts are littered with potential pitfalls, which must be sidestepped \\nto avoid errors of interpretation during an analysis. The main types of potential traps are \\nas follows.\\n(a)The stability principle (which prevents any simplistic reasoning)\\nThis principle holds that a company’s earnings are much more stable than we would \\nexpect. Net income is frequently a modest amount that remains when charges are offset \\nagainst revenues. Net income represents an equilibrium that is not necessarily upset by \\nexternal factors. Let’s consider, for instance, a supermarket chain where the net income \\nis roughly equal to the net financial income. It would be a mistake to say that if interest \\nrates decline, the company’s earnings will be wiped out. The key issue here is whether \\nthe company will be able to slightly raise its prices to offset the impact of lower interest \\nrates, without eroding its competitiveness. It will probably be able to do so if all its rivals \\nare in the same boat. But the company may be doomed to fail if more efficient distribution \\nchannels exist.'),\n",

A poor harvest drives up the cost \\nof grapes, and pushes up the selling price of champagne. Here the key issues are when \\nprices should be increased in view of the competition from sparkling wines, the likely \\nemergence of an alternative product at some point in the future and consumers’ ability to \\nmake do without champagne if it is too expensive.\\nIt is important not to repeat the common mistake of establishing a direct link between \\ntwo parameters and explaining one by trends in the other.\\nA company’s margins also depend to a great extent on those of its rivals. The purpose \\nof ﬁnancial analysis is to understand why they are above or below those of its rivals.\\nThat said, there are limits to the stability principle.\\n(b) Regulatory changes\\nThese are controls imposed on a company by an authority (usually the government) that \\ngenerally restricts the “natural” direction in which the company is moving. Examples \\ninclude an aggressive devaluation, the introduction of a shorter working week or mea-\\nsures to reduce the opening hours of shops.\\n(c)External factors\\nLike regulatory changes, these are imposed on the company. That said, they are more \\ncommon and are specific to the company’s sector of activity, e.g. pressures in a market, \\narrival (or sudden reawakening) of a very powerful competitor or changes to a collective \\nbargaining agreement.\\n(d)Pre-emptive action\\nPre-emptive action is where a company immediately reflects expectations of an increase \\nin the cost of a production factor by charging higher selling prices. This occurs in the \\nchampagne sector where the build-up of pressure in the raw materials market following a \\npoor grape harvest very soon leads to an increase in prices per bottle. Such action is taken \\neven though it will be another two or three years before the champagne comes onto the \\nmarketplace.\\nPre-emptive action is particularly rapid where no alternative products exist in the short to \\nmedium term and competition in the sector is not very intense. It leads to gains or losses \\non inventories that can be established by valuing them only at their replacement cost.\\n(e)Inertia effects\\nInertia effects are much more common than those we have just described, and they work \\nin the opposite direction. Owing to inertia, a company may struggle to pass on fluctua-\\ntions in the cost of its production factors by upping its selling prices. For instance, in \\na sector that is as competitive and has such low barriers to entry as the road haulage \\nbusiness, there is usually a delay before an increase in diesel fuel prices is passed on to \\ncustomers in the form of higher shipping charges.'),\n",

Building up excess inventories is \\nanother temptation in high-inflation environments because time increases the value of \\ninventories, thereby offsetting the financial expense involved in carrying them and giving \\nrise to inflation gains in the accounts.\\nInflation gives rise to a whole series of similar temptations for artificial gains, and \\nany players opting for a more cautious approach during such periods of madness may \\nfind themselves steamrollered out of existence. By refusing to build up their inventories \\nto an excessively high level and missing out on inflation gains, they are unable to pass on \\na portion of them to consumers, as their competitors do. Consequently, during periods of \\ninflation:\\ntdepreciation and amortisation are in most cases insufficient to cover the replacement \\ncost of an investment, the price of which has risen;\\nt inventories yield especially large nominal inflation gains where they are slow-moving.\\nDeflation leads to the opposite results.\\n(g)Capital expenditure and restructuring\\nIt is fairly common for major investments (e.g. the construction of a new plant) to depress \\noperating performance and even lead to operating losses during the first few years after \\nthey enter service.\\nFor instance, the construction of a new plant generally leads to:\\nt additional general and administrative costs such as R&D and launch costs, profes-\\nsional fees, etc;\\nt financial costs that are not matched by any corresponding operating revenue until \\nthe investment comes on stream (this is a common phenomenon in the hotel sector \\ngiven the length of the payback periods on investments). In certain cases, they may \\nbe capitalised and added to the cost of fixed assets but this is even more dangerous;\\nt additional personnel cost deriving from the early recruitment of line staff and manag-\\ners, who have to be in place by the time the new plant enters service;\\nt lower productivity owing both to the time it takes to get the new plant and equipment \\nrunning and the inexperience of staff at the new production facilities.\\nAs a result of these factors, some of the investment spending finds its way onto the income \\nstatement, which is thus weighed down considerably by the implications of the invest-\\nment programme.\\nConversely, a company may deliberately decide to pursue a policy of underinvest-\\nment to enhance its bottom line (so they can be sold at an inflated price) and to maximise \\nthe profitability of investments it carried out some time ago. But this type of strategy \\nof maximising margins jeopardises its scope for value creation in the future (it will not \\ncreate any new product, it will not train sufficient staff to prepare for changes in its \\nbusiness, etc.).'),\n",

In 2010, activity picked up, led by \\nemerging countries and, in particular, Russia (catch-up effect). This was only a short-term \\nphenomenon as sales dropped again by 8% in 2012 and again by 8% in 2013. There are \\nthree main explanations: the strength of the euro which depresses sales made in Eastern \\nEuropean currencies when translated into euros; deflation in the white goods industry (the \\nprice of a fridge went down by 31% in Italy between 2008 and 2013) and a loss in market \\nshare due to excellent performances from LG and Samsung accounting now for roughly \\n5% each against 2% five years ago.\\nDespite such volatility in sales, Indesit had succeeded in maintaining a decent oper-\\nating margin until 2013 thanks to the transfer of part of the production to, and sourcing \\nfrom, low-cost countries (e.g. Poland). But the operating margin was divided by two in \\n2013 as Indesit suffered from having too many production facilities in Western Europe \\nwhere the hourly labour cost is around €24 versus €5–6 in Poland, Turkey or Russia \\nwhere new entrants on the European market have set up their plants. Even if labour \\naccounts for around 10% of sales and productivity is better in Western Europe, this has \\nan impact on margins.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nThe ﬁrst step in any ﬁnancial analysis is to analyse a company’s margins. This is absolutely \\nvital because a company that fails to sell its products or services to its customers above \\ntheir cost is doomed.\\nAn analysis of margins and their level relative to those of a company’s competitors reveals a \\ngood deal about the strength of a company’s strategic position in its sector.\\nOperating proﬁt, which reﬂects the proﬁts generated by the operating cycle, is a central \\nﬁgure in income statement analysis. First of all, we look at how the ﬁgure is formed based \\non the following factors:\\ntsales, which are broken down to show the rate of growth in volumes and prices, with \\ntrends being compared with growth rates in the market or the sector;\\nt production, which leads to an examination of the level of unsold products and the \\naccounting method used to value inventories, with overproduction possibly heralding \\na serious crisis;\\nt raw materials used and other external charges, which need to be broken down into their \\nmain components (raw materials, transportation, distribution costs, advertising, etc.) \\nand analysed in terms of their quantities and costs;\\nt personnel cost, which can be used to assess the workforce’s productivity (sales/\\naverage headcount, value-added/average headcount) and the company’s grip on costs \\n(personnel cost/average headcount);\\nt depreciation and amortisation, which reﬂect the company’s investment policy.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

In this \\nchapter, we will compare all company costs and key profit indicators as a percentage of \\nsales (or production for companies that experience major swings in their inventories of \\nfinished goods and work in progress).\\nThe purpose of this analysis is to avoid extrapolating into the future the rate of earn-\\nings growth recorded in the past. Just because profits grew by 30% p.a. for two years as \\na result of a number of factors, does not mean they will necessarily keep growing at the \\nsame pace going forward.\\nEarnings and sales may not grow at the same pace owing to the following factors:\\nt structural changes in production;\\nt the scissors effect (see Chapter 9);\\nt simply a cyclical effect accentuated by the company’s cost structure. This is what we \\nwill be examining in more detail in this chapter.\\nSection 10.1\\nHOW OPERATING LEVERAGE WORKS\\nOperating leverage links variation in activity (measured by sales) with changes in result \\n(either operating profit or net income). Operating leverage depends on the level and nature \\nof the breakeven point.\\n1/ DEFINITION\\nBreakeven is the level of activity at which total revenue covers total costs. With busi-\\nness running at this level, earnings are thus zero.\\nPut another way:\\nt if the company does not reach breakeven (i.e. insufficient sales), the company posts \\nlosses;\\nt if sales are exactly equal to the breakeven point, profits are zero;\\nt if the company exceeds its breakeven point, it generates a profit.'),\n",

This classification depends on the period under consideration. \\nFor instance, it is legitimate to say that:\\ntin the long term, all costs are variable, irrespective of their nature. If a company is \\nunable to adjust its cost base, it is not a viable company;\\nt in the very short term (less than three months), almost all costs are fixed, with the \\nexception of certain direct costs (i.e. certain raw materials);\\nt from a medium-term perspective, certain costs can be considered variable, e.g. indi-\\nrect personnel cost.\\nThe breakeven point cannot be deﬁned in absolute terms. It depends ﬁrst and foremost \\non the length of the period under consideration. It usually decreases as the period in \\nquestion increases.\\nBefore starting to calculate a company’s breakeven point, it is wise to define which type \\nof breakeven point is needed. This obvious step is all too commonly forgotten.\\nFor instance, we may want to assess:\\nt the projected change in the company’s earnings in the event of a partial recession \\nwith or without a reduction in the company’s output;\\nt the sensitivity of earnings to particularly strong business levels at the end of \\nthe\\xa0year;\\nt the breakeven point implied by a strategic plan, particularly that resulting from the \\nlaunch of a new business venture.\\nThe breakeven point can be presented graphically:\\nTotal\\nexpenses\\nValue (€)\\nVariable costs\\nBreakeven point Unit sales\\nSales\\nProfit\\nLossOperational and\\nfinancial fixed\\ncosts'),\n",

At the \\nbreakeven point, the following equation therefore holds true:\\nContribution margin Fixed costs\\nor Sales Fixed costs\\ni.e. Sale\\n=\\n×=m 0\\nss Fixed costs\\nwith Sales Variable costs\\nSales\\n0 =\\n= −\\nm\\nm\\nwhere Sales0 is the level of sales at the breakeven point and m is the contribution margin \\nexpressed as a percentage of sales.\\nExample A company has sales of €150m, fixed costs of €90m and variable costs  \\nof €50m.\\nIts contribution margin is thus 150 − 50 = 100, i.e. 100/150 = 66.67% when \\nexpressed as a percentage of sales.\\nThe breakeven point thus lies at: 90/0.6667 = €135m. In this example, the company \\nis 11.1% above its breakeven point.\\nIn 2014, Exane BNP Paribas estimated that the typical European listed group with \\nrevenue of €100 had €28.6 of fixed costs, €61.7 of variable costs and an operating profit \\nof €9.7. Accordingly, a decrease of 1% in turnover results in a decrease of 3.9% in operat-\\ning profit. The operating leverage measures the sensitivity of operating result to changes \\nin sales. In this example it is 3.9%/1% = 3.9.\\n \\nOperating leverage Variable costs= −\\n−\\nSales Variable costs\\nSales −−\\n= −\\n−− =\\nFixed costs\\nOperating leverage 1.7\\n28.6 3.9100 6\\n100 61.7\\n3/ THREE  DIFFERENT  BREAKEVEN  POINTS\\nThe breakeven point may be calculated before or after payments to the company’s provid-\\ners of funds. As a result, three different breakeven points may be calculated:\\n t operating breakeven , which is a function of the company’s fixed and variable  \\nproduction costs that determine the stability of operating profit;\\n t financial breakeven, which takes into account the interest costs incurred by the com-\\npany that determine the stability of profit before tax and non-recurring items.\\n t total breakeven, which takes into account all the returns required by the company’s \\nlenders and shareholders.\\nOperating breakeven is a dangerous concept because it disregards any return on capital \\ninvested in the company, while financial breakeven understates the actual breakeven point \\nbecause it does not reflect any return on equity, which is the basis of all value creation.'),\n",

To this end, we need to adjust the \\ncompany’s cost base by the profit before tax expected by shareholders. Below this break-\\neven point, the company might generate a profit, but will not (totally) satisfy the profit-\\nability requirements of its shareholders.\\nInterest charges represent a fixed cost at a given level of sales (and thus capital \\nrequirement). A company that experiences significant volatility in its operating profit  \\nmay thus compensate partially for this instability through modest financial expense, \\ni.e. by pursuing a strategy of limited debt. In any event, earnings instability is greater \\nfor a highly indebted company owing to its financial expense which represents a  \\nfixed cost.\\nTo illustrate these concepts in concrete terms, we have prepared the following table \\ncalculating the various breakeven points for Indesit:1\\n1 We analyse the \\ntable for Indesit \\nin Section 10.4 \\nof this chapter \\n(see page 175). \\nWe have assumed \\nthat costs of sales \\nand selling and \\nmarketing costs \\nare all variable \\ncosts and that \\nother operating \\ncosts are fixed. \\nThis is evidently \\na rough cut but \\nnevertheless \\ngives a reason-\\nable estimate.\\n€m 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\\nSales 2613 2879 2825 2886 2671\\nOperating ﬁxed costs FC 505 607 581 593 537\\nFinancial ﬁxed costs FiC 52 35 37 31 52\\nVariable costs VC 1939 2044 2103 2182 2050\\nContribution margin  \\nas a % of sales \\nm VC= −Sales\\nSales 26% 29% 26% 24% 23%\\nOperating  \\nbreakeven\\nSalesop = FC\\nm 1957 2093 2273 2431 2310\\nPosition of the \\ncompany relative to \\noperating breakeven \\nas a % \\nSales\\nSalesop\\n− 1 +33% +38% +24% +19% +16%\\nFinancial  \\nbreakeven\\nSalesf = +FC FiC\\nm\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟ 2158 2212 2418 2558 2533\\nPosition of the \\ncompany relative to \\nﬁnancial breakeven \\nSales\\nSalesf\\n−1 +21% +30% +17% +13% +5%\\nTotal breakeven2 Sales /(1)\\nt = ++ ×−FC FiC kE book equity T\\nm\\nc\\n2749 2562 2998 3261 3067\\nPosition of the  \\ncompany relative to  \\ntotal breakeven\\nSales\\nSalest\\n−1 −5% +12% −6% −12% −13%\\n2 For Indesit, we have assumed a cost of equity (see Chapter 19) of 10% in 2010–2013 and 15% in 2009, and a tax rate of 50% for 2009 and 40% \\nfrom 2010 onwards.'),\n",

Sales 20% above \\nthe financial breakeven point reflect a relatively stable situation and sales more than 20% \\nabove the financial breakeven point for a given business structure indicate an exceptional \\nand comfortable situation.\\nThe 2008–2009 economic crisis has demonstrated that being 20% above the break-\\neven point is not enough in some sectors where activity can suddenly collapse by 20%, \\n30% or 40% as in the cement, steel or car industries. \\nSection 10.2\\nA MORE REFINED ANALYSIS PROVIDES GREATER INSIGHT\\n1/ ANALYSIS OF PAST SITUATIONS\\nBreakeven analysis (also known as cost–volume–profit analysis) may be used for three \\ndifferent purposes:\\ntto analyse earnings stability taking into account the characteristics of the market and \\nthe structure of production costs;\\nt to assess a company’s real earnings power;\\nt to analyse the difference between forecasts and actual performance.\\n(a) Analysis of earnings stability\\nHere the level of the breakeven point in absolute terms matters much less than the com-\\npany’s position relative to its breakeven point.\\nThe closer a company is to its breakeven point, the higher its earnings instability.\\nWhen a company is close to its breakeven point, a small change in sales triggers a \\nsteep change in its net income, so a strong rate of earnings growth may simply reflect a \\ncompany’s proximity to its breakeven point. \\nConsider a company with the following manufacturing and sales characteristics:\\nTotal ﬁxed costs = €200 000\\nVariable costs per unit = €50\\nUnit selling price = €100\\nIts breakeven point stands at 4000 units.

This phenomenon holds true both \\nabove and below the breakeven point.\\nWe should be wary when proﬁts are increasing much faster than sales for a com-\\npany with low margins, since this phenomenon may be attributable to the operating \\nleverage.\\nConsequently, breakeven analysis helps put into perspective a very strong rate of earn-\\nings growth during a good year. Rather than getting carried away with one good perfor-\\nmance, analysts should attempt to assess the risks of subsequent downturns in reported \\nprofits.\\nFor instance, France Télécom and Maroc Télécom posted similar sales trends but com-\\npletely different earnings trends during 2012 because their proximity to breakeven point \\nwas very different.

A 7% increase in Pirelli’s turnover drives its earnings up by \\n34%, whereas a similar increase in sales leads to a similar increase in Compass’s operat-\\ning income (8%). The situation of Roche (pharmaceutical products) stands in between the \\ntwo extremes of food and support services (very limited fixed costs) and tyre production \\n(the largest proportion of fixed costs).\\nIn case of a slump in activity, Pirelli’s results will decline faster than Compass’s due \\nto Pirelli’s much higher proportion of fixed costs. The operating leverage of Pirelli is high \\nand that of Compass is low.\\n(b)Assessment of normal earnings power\\nThe operating leverage, which accelerates the pace of growth or contraction in a com-\\npany’s earnings triggered by changes in its sales performance, means that the significance \\nof income statement-based margin analysis should be kept in perspective.\\nThe reason for this is that an exceptionally high level of profits may be attributable \\nto exceptionally good conditions that will not last. In such conditions good performance \\ndoes not necessarily indicate a high level of structural profitability. This held true for a \\nlarge number of companies in 2000.\\nConsequently, an assessment of a company’s earnings power deriving from its struc-\\ntural profitability drivers needs to take into account the operating leverage and cyclical \\ntrends, i.e. are we currently in an expansion phase of the cycle?\\n(c)Variance analysis\\nBreakeven analysis helps analysts account for differences between the budgeted and \\nactual performance of a company over a given period.\\nThe following table helps illustrate this:\\nValue in absolute terms Structure\\nBudget Actual (A) Change %\\nDifference\\nTheoretical \\ncost\\nstructure \\n(B)\\nDifference \\n(B) − (A)\\nSales 240 180 −60 −25% −\\nVariable costs 200 156 −44 −22% 150 −6\\nContribution \\nmargin40 24 −16 −40% 30 −6\\nMargin 16.7% 13.3%\\nFixed costs 20 24 +4 +20% 20 +4\\nEarnings 20 0 +20 −100% 10 −10\\nThis table shows the collapse in the company’s earnings of 20 is attributable to:\\nt the fall in sales (−25%);\\nt the surge in fixed costs (+20%);\\nt the surge in variable costs as a proportion of sales from 83.33% to 86.7%.'),\n",

In fact, they should have been seek-\\ning to achieve the lowest possible operating leverage and, above all, the most flexible \\npossible cost structure to curb the effects of major swings in business levels on their \\nprofitability.\\nFor instance, integration has often turned out to be a costly mistake in the construc-\\ntion sector. Only companies that have maintained a lean cost structure through a strategy \\nof outsourcing have been able to survive the successive cycles of boom and bust in the \\nsector.\\nIn highly capital-intensive sectors and those with high fixed costs (pulp, metal tubing, \\ncement, etc.), it is in companies’ interests to use equity financing. Such financing does \\nnot accentuate the impact of ups and downs in their sales on their bottom line through the \\nleverage effect of debt, but in fact attenuates their impact on earnings.\\nA breakeven analysis provides a link between ﬁnancial and industrial strategy.\\nWhen a company finds itself in a tight spot, its best financial strategy is to reduce its \\nfinancial breakeven point by raising fresh equity rather than debt capital, since the latter \\nactually increases its breakeven point, as we have seen. As an example of this policy, Bar-\\nrick Gold, Billabong and Peugeot raised equity from late 2013 to early 2014.\\nIf the outlook for its market points to strong sales growth in the long term, a company \\nmay decide to pick up the gauntlet and invest. In doing so, it raises its breakeven point, \\nwhile retaining substantial room for manoeuvre. It may thus decide to take on additional \\ndebt.\\nAs we shall see in Chapter 35, the only real difference in terms of cost between debt \\nand equity financing can be analysed in terms of a company’s breakeven point.\\n(b)Restructuring\\nWhen a company falls below its breakeven point, it sinks into the red. It can return to the \\nblack only by increasing its sales, lowering its breakeven point or boosting its margins.\\nIncreasing its sales is only a possibility if the company has real strategic clout in \\nits marketplace. Otherwise, it is merely delaying the inevitable: sales will grow at the \\nexpense of the company’s profitability, thereby creating an illusion of improvement for a \\nwhile but inevitably precipitating cash problems.\\nLowering the breakeven point entails restructuring industrial and commercial opera-\\ntions, e.g. modernisation, reductions in production capacity, cuts in overheads. The danger '),\n",

In \\nmany cases, a vicious circle sets in, as the measures taken to lower breakeven trigger \\na major business contraction, compelling the company to lower its breakeven point \\nfurther, thereby sparking another business contraction, and so on.\\n (c)Analysis of cyclical risks\\nAs we stated earlier, there is no such thing as an absolute breakeven point – there are as \\nmany breakeven points as there are periods of analysis. But first and foremost, the break-\\neven point is a dynamic rather than static concept. If sales fall by 5%, the mathematical \\nformulas will suggest that earnings may decline by 20%, 30% or more, depending on the \\nexact circumstances. In fact, experience shows that earnings usually fall much further \\nthan breakeven analysis predicts.\\nA contraction in market volumes is often accompanied by a price war, leading to a \\ndecline in the contribution margin. In this situation, fixed costs may increase as custom-\\ners are slower to pay; inventories build up leading to higher interest costs and higher \\noperating provisions. All these factors may trigger a larger reduction in earnings than that \\nimplied by the mathematical formulae of breakeven analysis.\\nDuring cyclical downturns, contribution margins tend to decline, while ﬁxed costs are \\noften higher than expected.\\nConsequently, breakeven point increases while sales decline, as many recent exam-\\nples show. Any serious forecasting thus requires modelling based on a thorough analysis \\nof the situation.\\nDuring the Spanish property slump of 2008, a mere slowdown in growth halted the \\nspeculators in their tracks. Crippled by their interest expense, they were compelled to \\nlower prices, which led to speculation of a fall in the market (purchases were delayed in \\nexpectation of an additional fall in prices).\\nBusinesses such as shipping and paper production, which require substantial pro-\\nduction capacity that takes time to set up, periodically experience production gluts or \\nshortages. As readers are aware, if supply is inflexible, a volume glut (or shortage) of just \\n5% may be sufficient to trigger far larger price reductions (or hikes) (i.e. 30%, 50% and \\nsometimes even more).\\nHere again, an analysis of competition (its strength, patterns and financial structure) \\nis a key factor when assessing the scale of a crisis.\\nSection 10.3\\nFROM ANALYSIS TO FORECASTING : THE CONCEPT OF NORMATIVE MARGIN\\nNowadays, a great deal of the analysis of financial statements for past periods is car-\\nried out for the purpose of preparing financial projections. These forecasts are based on \\nthe company’s past and the decisions taken by management. This section contains some \\nadvice about how best to go about this type of exercise.'),\n",

This \\nmay be reasonable in itself, but implies unreasonable assumptions when applied system-\\natically. Trees do not grow to the sky!\\nInstead, readers should:\\nt gain a full understanding of the company and especially its key drivers and margins;\\nt build growth scenarios, as well as possible reactions by the competition, the environ-\\nment, international economic conditions, etc.;\\nt draw up projections and analyse the coherence of the company’s economic and stra-\\ntegic policy. For example, is its investment sufficient?\\nTo this end, financial analysts have developed the concept of normalised earnings, \\ni.e. a given company in a given sector should achieve an operating margin of x%.\\nThis type of approach is entirely consistent with financial theory, which states that in \\neach sector profitability should be commensurate with the sector’s risks and that, sooner \\nor later, these margins will be achieved, even though adjustments may take considerable \\ntime (i.e. five years or even more, in any case much longer than they do in the financial \\nmarkets).\\nWhat factors influence the size of these margins? This question can be answered only \\nin qualitative terms and by performing an analysis of the strategic strengths and weak-\\nnesses of a company, which are all related to the concept of barriers to entry:\\ntthe degree of maturity of the business;\\nt the strength of competition and quality of other market players;\\nt the importance of commercial factors, such as market share, brands, distribution net-\\nworks, etc.\\nt the type of industrial process and incremental productivity gains.\\nThis approach is helpful because it takes into consideration the economic underpinnings \\nof margins. Its drawback lies in the fact that analysts may be tempted to overlook the \\ncompany’s actual margin and concentrate more on its future, theoretical margins.\\nWe cannot overemphasise the importance of explicitly stating and verifying the sig-\\nnificance of all forecasts.\\nSection 10.4\\nCASE STUDY : INDESIT 3\\nMost of the time the information provided by listed companies is not enough for an \\nexternal analyst to be able to compute the breakeven point precisely.\\nA rough estimate may be made using linear regression of each cost against net sales \\nto approximate the breakdown between fixed and variable costs. For Indesit, we have \\nassumed that cost of sales were variable costs (which is probably a bit optimistic) whereas \\nother operating costs were fixed (which seems a decent assumption looking at the evolu-\\ntion over the period).\\n3 The breakeven \\ntable for Indesit \\nis on page 169.'),\n",

And 2010 saw a culmi-\\nnation of this trend. Since then Indesit progressively lost control over its breakeven point: \\nit increased by 10% in three years while sales fell by 7% over the same period. Instead \\nof being 38% above its operating breakeven as in 2010, Indesit was only 16% above it in \\n2013.\\nThe situation is even more alarming regarding total breakeven (which includes \\nproper remuneration for its equity). From being 12% above in 2010, Indesit spent two \\nyears in a row (2012 and 2013) below its total breakeven point by more 10%. No surprise \\nthat its controlling shareholder decided to hire an advisor at the end of 2013 to study the \\npossibility of merging Indesit with one of its competitors.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com. \\nThe breakeven point is the level of business activity, measured in terms of sales, production \\nor the quantity of goods sold, at which total revenues cover total costs. At this level of sales, \\na company makes zero proﬁt.\\nThe breakeven point is not an absolute level – it depends on the length of period being \\nconsidered because the distinction between ﬁxed and variable costs can be justiﬁed only by \\na set of assumptions and, sooner or later, any ﬁxed cost can be made variable.\\nThree different breakeven points may be calculated:\\ntoperating breakeven, which is a function of the company’s ﬁxed and variable production \\ncosts. It determines the stability of operating activities, but may lead to ﬁnancing costs \\nbeing overlooked;\\nt ﬁnancial breakeven, which takes into account the interest expense incurred by the \\ncompany, but not its cost of equity;\\nt total breakeven, which takes into account both interest expense and the net proﬁt \\nrequired by shareholders. As a result, it takes into account all the returns required by all \\nof the company’s providers of funds.\\nOperating breakeven is calculated by dividing a company’s ﬁxed costs by its contribution \\nmargin ((sales – variable costs)/sales). Financial breakeven is calculated by adding interest \\nexpense to the ﬁxed costs in the previous formula. Total breakeven is computed by adding \\nthe net income required to cover the cost of equity to ﬁxed operating costs and interest \\ncosts.\\nThe calculation and a static analysis of a company’s breakeven point can be used to assess \\nthe stability of its earnings, its normal earnings power and the actual importance of the dif-\\nferences between budgeted and actual performance. The further away a company lies from \\nits breakeven point, the more stable its earnings and the more signiﬁcant its earnings trends \\nare. The higher its ﬁxed costs as a share of total costs, the higher the breakeven point and \\nthe greater the operating leverage and the volatility of its earnings are.\\nAn analysis of trends in the operating leverage over time reveals a good deal about the \\ncompany’s industrial strategy. An attempt to harness economies of scale will raise the break-\\neven point and thus make a company more sensitive to economic trends. Efforts to make its \\nindustrial base more ﬂexible will lower its breakeven point, but may also reduce its potential \\nearnings power.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

In \\nfinance, investment means creating either new fixed assets or working capital. The latter, \\noften high in continental Europe, deserves some explanation.\\nSection 11.1\\nTHE NATURE  OF WORKING  CAPITAL\\nEvery analyst intuitively tries to establish a percentage relationship between a company’s \\nworking capital and one or more of the measures of the volume of its business activities. \\nIn most cases, the chosen measure is annual turnover or sales.\\nThe ratio:\\n \\nOperating wo king c l\\nAnnual sales\\nr apita\\nreflects the fact that the operating cycle generates an operating working capital that \\nincludes:\\n t capital “frozen” in the form of inventories, representing procurement and production \\ncosts that have not yet resulted in the sale of the company’s products;\\n t funds “frozen” in customer receivables, representing sales that customers have not \\nyet paid for;\\n t accounts payable that the company owes to suppliers.\\nThe balance of these three items represents the net amount of money tied up in the oper-\\nating cycle of the company. In other words, if the working capital turnover ratio is 25% \\n(which is high), this means that 25% of the company’s annual sales volume is “frozen” \\nin inventories and customer receivables not financed by supplier credit. This also means \\nthat, at any moment, the company needs to have on hand funds equal to a quarter of its \\nannual sales to pay suppliers and employee salaries for materials and work performed on \\nproducts or services that have not yet been manufactured, sold or paid for by customers.\\nAs we will see in Section 11.2, working capital is often expressed as a number of days \\nof sales. This figure is derived by multiplying a percentage ratio by 365. In our example, a \\nratio of 25% indicates that working capital totals around 90 days of the company’s sales.'),\n",

According to traditional financial theory, \\nthese amounts are very liquid; that is, they will either be collected or paid within a very \\nshort period of time. But in fact, although it is liquid, working capital also reflects a \\npermanent requirement.\\nNo matter when the books are closed, the balance sheet always shows working capital, \\nalthough the amount changes depending on the statement date. The only exceptions are \\nthe rare companies whose operating cycle actually generates cash rather than absorbs it.\\nThere is an apparent contradiction between the essentially liquid nature of working \\ncapital on the one hand and its permanence on the other.\\nWorking capital is liquid in the sense that every element of it disappears in the ordinary \\ncourse of business. Raw materials and inventories are consumed in the manufacturing \\nprocess. Work in progress is gradually transformed into finished products. Finished prod-\\nucts are (usually) sold. Receivables are (ordinarily) collected and become cash, bank bal-\\nances, etc. Similarly, debts to suppliers become outflows of cash when they are paid.\\nAs a result, if the production cycle is less than a year (which is usually the case) all of \\nthe components of working capital at the statement date will disappear in the course of the \\nfollowing year. But at the next statement date, other operating assets will have taken their \\nplace.This is why we view working capital as a permanent requirement.\\nEven if each component of working capital has a relatively short lifetime, the operat-\\ning cycles are such that the contents of each are replaced by new contents. As a result, if \\nthe level of business activity is held constant, the various working capital accounts remain \\nat a constant level.\\nAll in all, at any given point in time, a company’s working capital is indeed liquid. It \\nrepresents the difference between certain current assets and certain current liabilities. But \\nthinking in terms of “permanent working capital” introduces a radically different concept. \\nIt suggests that if business is stable, current (liquid) operating assets and current operating \\nliabilities will be renewed and new funds will be tied up, constituting a permanent capital \\nrequirement as surely as fixed assets are a permanent capital requirement.\\nWorking capital is two-sided. From the point of view of balance sheet value, it is \\nliquid. From a going-concern point of view, it is permanent.\\n2/ SEASONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY , PARTLY SEASONAL REQUIREMENT\\nWhen a business is seasonal, purchases, production and sales do not take place evenly \\nthroughout the year. As a result, working capital also varies during the course of the year, \\nexpanding then contracting.\\nThe working capital of a seasonal business never falls to zero. Whether the company \\nsells canned vegetables or raincoats, a minimum level of inventories is always needed to \\ncarry the company over to the next production cycle.\\nIn our experience, companies in seasonal businesses often pay too much attention to \\nthe seasonal aspect of their working capital and ignore the fact that a significant part of it \\nis permanent.

This means that half of the working capital is \\npermanent, the other half is seasonal.\\n3/ CONCLUSION : PERMANENT WORKING CAPITAL AND THE COMPANY ’S ONGOING NEEDS\\nAn external analyst risks confusing the working capital on the balance sheet with the \\npermanent working capital.\\nApproximately 36% of all companies close their books at a date other than 31 December. \\nBordeaux vineyards close on 30 September, Caribbean car rental companies on 30 April. \\nThey choose these dates because that is when the working capital requirement shown on \\ntheir balance sheets is lowest. This is pure window dressing.\\nA company in trouble uses trade credit to the maximum possible extent. In this case, \\nyou must restate working capital by eliminating trade credit that is in excess of normal \\nlevels. Similarly, if inventory is unusually high at the end of the year because the company \\nspeculated that raw material prices would rise, then the excess over normal levels should \\nbe eliminated in the calculation of permanent working capital. Lastly, to avoid giving the \\nimpression that the company is too cash-rich, some companies make an extra effort to pay \\ntheir suppliers before the end of the year. This is more akin to investing cash balances than \\nto managing working capital.\\nIt may be rash to say that the working capital at ﬁscal year end is the company’s per-\\nmanent working capital.\\nAlthough the working capital on the balance sheet at year end can usually not be used as \\nan indicator of the company’s permanent requirement, its year-to-year change can still be \\ninformative. Calculated at the same date every year, there should be no seasonal impact. \\nAnalysing how the requirement has changed from year end to year end can shed light on \\nwhether the company’s operations are improving or deteriorating.\\nThe year-end working capital is informative only if compared with the working capital \\nat other year-end dates.\\nYou are therefore faced with a choice:\\nt if the company publishes quarterly financial statements, you can take the permanent \\nworking capital to be the lowest of the quarterly balances and the average working \\ncapital to be the average of the figures for each of the four quarters;\\nt if the company publishes only year-end statements, you must reason in terms of year-\\nto-year trends and comparisons with competitors.1\\nSection 11.2\\nWORKING CAPITAL TURNOVER RATIOS\\nAs financial analysis consists of uncovering hidden realities, let’s simulate reality to help \\nus understand the analytical tools.\\n1  Provided \\ncompetitors have \\nthe same balance \\nsheet closing \\ndate.'),\n",

In this \\ncase, the calculated figures will be irrelevant. To take an extreme example, imagine \\na company that makes all its sales in a single month. If it grants payment terms of \\none month, its number of days’ receivables at the end of that month will be 365;\\nt they provide no breakdown – unless more detailed information is available – of the \\nturnover of the components of each asset (or liability) item related to the operating \\ncycle. For example, receivables might include receivables from private sector cus-\\ntomers, international customers and government agencies. These three categories can \\nhave very different collection periods (government agencies, for instance, are known \\nto pay late).\\nYou must ask yourself what degree of precision you want to achieve in your analysis of \\nthe company. If a general idea is enough, you might be satisfied with average ratios, as \\ncalculated above, after verifying that:\\ntthe business is not too seasonal;\\nt if it is seasonal, that the available data refer to the same point in time during the year. \\nIf this is the case, we advise you to express the ratios in terms of a percentage (receiv-\\nables/sales), which does not imply a direct link with actual payment conditions.\\nIf you need a more detailed analysis, you will have to look at the actual business volumes \\nin the period just prior to the statement date. In this case, the daily sales figure will not \\nbe the annual sales divided by 365, but the last quarter’s sales divided by 90, the last two \\nmonths divided by 60, etc.\\nIf you must perform an in-depth audit of outstandings in the balance sheet, averages \\nare not enough. You must compare outstandings with the transactions that gave rise to them.\\nSection 11.3\\nREADING BETWEEN THE LINES OF WORKING CAPITAL\\nEvaluating working capital is an important part of an analyst’s job in Continental Europe \\nbecause intercompany financing plays a prominent role in the economy. In Anglo-Saxon \\ncountries, this analysis is less important because working capital is much lower, either \\nbecause it is usual practice to offer a discount for prompt payments (USA) or because for \\ndecades companies have been used to paying promptly.\\n1/ GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\\nIn principle, the ratio of working capital to annual sales should remain stable.\\nIf the permanent requirement equals 25% of annual sales and sales grow from €100m\\nto €140m, the working capital requirement should grow by €10m (€40m × 25%).\\nGrowth in business volume causes an increase in working capital. This increase \\nappears, either implicitly or explicitly, in the cash flow statement.\\nGrowth in the company’s business tends to increase the amount of working capital. This \\nincrease represents an additional need that a business plan must take into account.'),\n",

Experience shows, however, that growth very often causes a \\nsharp, sometimes poorly controlled, increase in working capital at least proportional to \\nthe growth in the company’s sales volume.\\nIn fact, a growing company is often confronted with working capital that grows \\nfaster than sales, for various reasons:\\nt management sometimes neglects to manage working capital rigorously, concentrat-\\ning instead on strategy and on increasing sales;\\nt management often tends to integrate vertically, both upstream and downstream. Con-\\nsequently, structural changes to working capital are introduced as it starts growing \\nmuch more rapidly than sales, as we will explain later on.\\nWhen a company is growing, the increase in working capital constitutes a real use of \\nfunds, just as surely as capital expenditures do. For this reason, increases in working \\ncapital must be analysed and projected with equal care.\\nEfficient companies are characterised by controlled growth in working capital. \\nIndeed, successful expansion often depends on the following two conditions:\\ntensuring that the growth in working capital tracks the growth in sales rather than \\nzooming ahead of it;\\nt creating a corporate culture that strives to contain working capital. If working capital \\ngrows unchecked, sooner or later it will lead to serious financial difficulties and com-\\npromise the company’s independence.\\nToday, companies faced with slower growth in business manage working capital strictly \\nthrough just-in-time inventory management, greater use of outsourcing, reorganization of \\ninternal payment circuits, financial incentives for salespeople linked to customers’ pay-\\nments, etc. (as we will see in Chapter 48).\\nSince the beginning of this century, the working capital of large listed European \\ngroups has had a tendency to shrink as illustrated in the following table: \\nSector 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014e 2015e\\nAerospace & Defence −1% −16% −21% −21% −21% −18% −16% −15%\\nAutomotive 4% 2% 1% −0% −1% −1% −1% −1%\\nBuilding Materials 13% 12% −6% −6% −6% −6% −6% −5%\\nCapital Goods 6% 6% 4% 6% 5% 8% 9% 9%\\nConsumer Goods 22% 15% 10% 11% 10% 12% 11% 11%\\nFood Retail −3% −5% −8% −7% −8% −7% −8% −7%\\nIT Services 19% −3% 2% 1% 0% 1% 2% 2%\\nLuxury Goods 22% 15% 17% 19% 22% 23% 23% 22%\\nMedia −10% −18% −16% −16% −14% −10% −11% −11%\\nMining 10% 11% 10% 9% 12% 12% 11% 11%\\nOil & Gas 2% 2% 4% 4% 4% 5% 5% 5%\\nPharmaceuticals 18% 11% 9% 11% 9% 7% 9% 10%\\nSteel 26% 10% 23% 19% 18% 18% 18% 18%\\nTelecom Operators −10% −12% −13% −11% −12% −5% −5% −4%\\nUtilities 4% −6% 2% 0% 1% 1% 1% 1%\\nSource: Exane BNP Paribas'),\n",

This increase is primarily due to the rise in prices which, at \\nconstant payment terms, increases production costs and receivables.\\n2/ RECESSION\\nBy analysing the working capital of a company facing a sudden drop in its sales, we can \\nsee that it reacts in stages.\\nInitially, the company does not adjust its production levels. Instead it tries other ways \\nto shore up sales. The recession also leads to difficulty in controlling accounts receivable, \\nbecause customers start having financial difficulties and stretch out their payments over \\ntime. The company’s cash situation deteriorates, and it has trouble honouring its commer-\\ncial obligations, so it secures more favourable payment terms from its suppliers. At the \\nend of this first phase, working capital – the balance between the various items affected by \\ndivergent forces – stabilises at a higher level. This situation was experienced in particular \\nby car manufacturers in late 2008.\\nIn the second phase, the company begins to adopt measures to adjust its operating \\ncycle to its new level of sales. It cuts back on production, trims raw material invento-\\nries and ratchets customer payment terms down to normal levels. By limiting purchases, \\naccounts payable also decline. These measures, salutary in the short term, have the para-\\ndoxical effect of inflating working capital because certain items remain stubbornly high \\nwhile accounts payable decline.\\nAs a result, the company produces (and sells) below capacity, causing unit costs to \\nrise and the bottom line to deteriorate.\\nFinally, in the third phase, the company returns to a sound footing:\\nt sales surpass production;\\nt the cap on purchases has stabilised raw material inventories. When purchases return \\nto their normal level, the company again benefits from a “normal” level of supplier \\ncredit.\\nAgainst this background, working capital stabilises at a low level that is once again pro-\\nportional to sales, but only after a crisis that might last as long as a year.\\nIt is important to recognise that any contraction strategy, regardless of the method cho-\\nsen, requires a certain period of psychological adjustment. Management must be convinced \\nthat the company is moving from a period of expansion to a period of recession. This psy-\\nchological change may take several weeks, but once it is accomplished, the company can:\\ntdecrease purchases;\\nt adjust production to actual sales;\\nt reduce supplier credit which the company had tried to maximise. Of course, this \\nslows down the reduction in working capital.\\nWe have seldom seen a company take less than nine months to significantly reduce its work-\\ning capital and improve the bottom line (unless it liquidates inventories at fire-sale prices).\\nDuring a recession, working capital has a paradoxical tendency to grow; then, despite \\nrestructuring measures, it still doesn’t budge. It is only towards the end of the recession \\nthat working capital subsides and the company gains breathing space.'),\n",

In so doing, they increase their value added. But this very process also \\nincreases their working capital because the increased value added is incorporated in the \\nvarious line items that make up working capital, notably receivables and finished goods \\ninventories. Conversely, accounts payable reflect purchases made further upstream and \\ntherefore contain less value added. So they become proportionately lower.\\n4/ NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL\\nThe operating cycles of companies with negative working capital are such that, thanks to a \\nfavourable timing mismatch, they collect funds prior to disbursing some payments. There \\nare two basic scenarios:\\ntsupplier credit is much greater than inventory turnover, while at the same time cus-\\ntomers pay quickly, in some cases in cash: food retailing, e-commerce companies, \\nmotorways, companies with very short production cycles like newspaper or yoghurt \\ncompanies, companies whose suppliers are in a position of such weakness – print-\\ners or hauliers that face stiff competition, for example – that they are forced to offer \\ninordinately long payment terms to their customers;\\nt customers pay in advance. This is the case for companies that work on military con-\\ntracts, collective catering companies, companies that sell subscriptions, etc. Never-\\ntheless, these companies are sometimes required to lock up their excess cash for as \\nlong as the customer has not yet “consumed” the corresponding service. In this case, \\nnegative working capital offers a way of earning significant investment income rather \\nthan presenting a source of funding that can be freely used by the firm to finance its \\noperations.\\nA low or negative working capital is a boon to a company looking to expand without \\nrecourse to external capital. Efficient companies, in particular in mass-market retailing, \\nall benefit from low or negative working capital. Put another way, certain companies are \\nadept at using intercompany credit to their best advantage.\\nThe presence of negative working capital can, however, lead to management \\nerrors. We once saw an industrial group that was loathe to sell a loss-making division \\nbecause it had a negative working capital. Selling the division would have shored up \\nthe group’s profitability but would also have created a serious cash management prob-\\nlem, because the negative working capital of the unprofitable division was financing \\nthe working capital of the profitable divisions. Short-sightedness blinded the company \\nto everything but the cash management problem it would have had immediately after \\nthe disposal.\\nWe have seen companies with negative working capital, losing money at the operat-\\ning level, that were able to survive because of a strong growth in sales. Consequently, \\ninflows generated by increasingly negative working capital with growth in revenues \\nallowed to pay for the operating deficit. The wake-up call is pretty tough when growth \\nslows down and payment difficulties appear. Unsurprisingly, no banker is keen to lend \\nmoney in this scenario.'),\n",

This makes generous payment terms much \\nless attractive for the buyer, because as long as his supplier is not paid, he cannot \\nprocess the raw material.\\nt Historical factors: in France, Italy and Spain, bank credit was restricted for a long \\ntime. Companies whose businesses were not subject to credit restrictions (building, \\nexports, energy, etc.) used their bank borrowing capacity to support companies sub-\\nject to the restrictions by granting them generous payment terms. Tweaking payment \\nterms was also a way of circumventing price controls in the Mediterranean countries.\\nt Technical factors: in the USA, suppliers often offer two-part trade credit, where a \\nsubstantial discount is offered for relatively early payment, such as a 2% discount for \\npayment made within 10 days. Most buyers take this discount. This discount explains \\nthe low level of accounts payable in US groups’ balance sheets. As a by-product, \\nfailure of a buyer to take this discount could serve as a very strong and early signal \\nof financial distress.\\nFurthermore, Delaunay and Dietsch (1999) have shown that supplier credit acts as a \\nfinancial shock absorber for companies in difficulty. For commercial reasons, suppliers \\n5/ WORKING CAPITAL AS AN EXPRESSION OF BALANCE OF POWER\\nEconomists have tried to understand the theoretical justification for intercompany \\ncredit, as represented by working capital. To begin with, they have found that there are \\ncertain minimum technical turnaround times. For example, a customer must verify that \\nthe delivery corresponds to his order and that the invoice is correct. Some time is also \\nnecessary to actually effect the payment.\\nBut this explains only a small portion of intercompany credit, which varies greatly \\nfrom one country to another:\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 201 22 0 1 3\\nActual payment delays in Europe (in days)\\nScandinavia\\nFrance\\nNetherlands Switzerland\\nGermany\\nBelgium\\nUnited Kingdom\\nSpain\\nItaly\\nEurope\\nSource: Intrum Justitia'),\n",

Suppliers know that they will not have \\ncomplete control over payment terms. They have unwittingly become bankers and, like \\nbankers, they attempt to limit payment terms on the basis of the back-up represented by \\nthe customer’s assets and capital.\\nThat said, it is unhealthy for companies to offer overly generous payment terms to \\ntheir customers. By so doing, they run a credit risk. Even though the corporate credit \\nmanager function is more and more common, even in small companies, credit managers \\nare not in the best position to appreciate and manage this risk. Moreover, intercompany \\ncredit is one of the causes of the domino effect in corporate bankruptcies.\\nIn conclusion, we reiterate the fact that intercompany credit is one of the most visible \\nmanifestations of the balance of power between customers and suppliers. The size of \\nintercompany credit serves as an indication of the strength of the company’s strategic \\nposition vis-à-vis its customers and suppliers.\\nHow else can we explain why 50% of industrial groups in the Euro Stoxx 50 (i.e. the \\n largest listed European groups) enjoy negative working capital?\\nSection 11.4\\nANALYSING  CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES  (CAPEX )\\nThe following three questions should guide your analysis of the company’s investments:\\n t What is the state of the company’s plant and equipment?\\n t What is the company’s capital expenditure policy?\\n t What are the cash flows generated by these investments?\\n1/ ANALYSING  THE  COMPANY ’S CURRENT  PRODUCTION  CAPACITY\\nThe current state of the company’s fixed assets is measured by the ratio2\\n \\nNet fixed assets\\nGross fixed assets.\\nA very low ratio (less than 30%) indicates that the company’s plant and equipment are prob-\\nably worn out.

The annual depreciation charge \\nis supposed to reflect this wearing out. By comparing capital expenditure with depre-\\nciation charges, you can determine whether the company is:\\nt expanding its industrial base by increasing production capacity. In this case, capital \\nexpenditure is higher than depreciation as the company invests more than simply to \\ncompensate for the annual wearing-out of fixed assets;\\nt maintaining its industrial base, replacing production capacity as necessary. In this \\ncase, capital expenditure approximately equals depreciation as the company invests \\njust to compensate for the annual wearing-out of fixed assets;\\nt underinvesting or divesting (capital expenditure below depreciation). This situation \\ncan only be temporary or the company’s future will be in danger, unless the objective \\nis to liquidate the company.\\nComparing capital expenditure with net fixed assets  at the beginning of the period \\ngives you an idea of the size of the investment programme with respect to the compa-\\nny’s existing production facilities. A company that invests an amount equal to 50% of its \\nexisting net fixed assets is building new facilities worth half what it has at the beginning \\nof the year. This strategy carries certain risks:\\ntrisk that economic conditions will take a turn for the worse;\\nt risk that production costs will be difficult to control (productivity deteriorates);\\nt technology risks, etc.\\n3/ ANALYSING THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS\\nThe theoretical relationship between capital expenditures on the one hand and the cash \\nflow from operating activities on the other is not simple. New fixed assets are combined \\nwith those already on the balance sheet, and together they generate the cash flow of the \\nperiod. Consequently, there is no direct link between operating cash flow and the capital \\nexpenditure of the period.\\nComparing cash flow from operating activities with capital expenditure makes sense \\nonly in the context of overall profitability and the dynamic equilibrium between sources \\nand uses of funds.\\nThe only reason to invest in fixed assets is to generate profits, i.e. positive cash flows. \\nAny other objective turns finance on its head. You must therefore be very careful when \\ncomparing the trends in capital expenditure, cash flow and cash flow from operating activ-\\nities. This analysis can be done by examining the cash flow statement.\\nAny investment strategy must, sooner or later, result in an increase in cash ﬂow from \\noperating activities. If it doesn’t, then the investments are not proﬁtable enough and \\nthe company is heading for trouble or, more likely, is already in trouble.\\nBe on the lookout for companies that, for reasons of hubris, grossly overinvest, despite \\ntheir cash flow from operating activities not growing at the same rate as their investments. \\nManagement has lost sight of the all-important criterion that is profitability.'),\n",

In D, investment is far below \\nthe company’s cash flow from operations. You must compare investment with deprecia-\\ntion charges so as to answer the following questions:\\ntIs the company living off the assets it has already acquired (profit generated by exist-\\ning fixed assets)?\\nt Is the company’s production equipment ageing?\\nt Are the company’s current capital expenditures appropriate, given the rate of techno-\\nlogical innovation in the sector?\\nNaturally, the risk in this situation is that the company is resting on its laurels, and that its \\ntechnology is falling behind that of its competitors. This will eat into the company’s prof-\\nitability and, as a result, into its cash flow from operating activities at the very moment it \\nwill most need cash in order to make the investments necessary to close the gap vis-à-vis \\nits rivals.\\nThe most important piece of information to be gleaned from a cash ﬂow statement is \\nthe relationship between capital expenditure and cash ﬂow from operating activities and \\ntheir respective growth rates.\\nGenerally speaking, you must understand that there are certain logical inferences that \\ncan be made by looking at the company’s investment policy. If its capital expenditure is \\nvery high, the company is embarking on a project to create significant new value rather \\nthan simply growing. Accordingly, future cash flow from operating activities will depend \\non the profitability of these new investments and is thus highly uncertain.\\nAll the above does not mean that capital expenditure should be financed by internal \\nsources only. Our point is simply that a good investment policy grows cash flow at the \\nsame rate as capital expenditure. This leads to a virtuous circle of growth, a necessary \\ncondition for the company’s financial equilibrium, as shown in graph A in this figure:\\nGrowing company\\nLarge, profitable investment Ageing production facilities\\nA B\\nC D\\nOverly large investment\\nInvestment\\nInvestment\\nInvestment Investment\\nCash flow from\\noperating activities\\nCash flow from\\noperating activities\\nCash flow from\\noperating activities\\nCash flow from\\noperating activities'),\n",

This is the first reason why so many mergers fail to deliver on promises (see \\nChapter 44).\\n t That of regular changes in the group perimeter which complicates its analysis and \\ncan hide real difficulties. \\n t And that of having overpaid for acquired companies. By carrying out an analysis of \\nprices paid (see Chapter 31), the external analyst can detect overpayments only if he \\nis provided with enough information by the acquirer.\\nThe frequency of acquisition of other companies gives clues about the concentration \\ninside a sector.

In particular, \\nIndesit seems to have strong bargaining power vis-à-vis its suppliers.\\nIndesit had succeeded in significantly reducing its working capital in 2009 (by three \\nweeks) in order to generate cash. In 2010 and onwards, the group could not manage the \\nsame achievement and the working capital was a bit less negative, despite a growth in \\nsales. In particular, Indesit had to reduce pressure on its clients. The management of \\nworking capital within the group remains extremely sound, i.e. still largely negative.\\n2/ CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS\\nIn 2009 and 2010, capex drops to €75m, i.e. close to half of the depreciation level. It is \\ntrue that when demand drops sharply, one can do better than invest in production capacity; \\nreduce net debt for example! This situation was not sustainable for very long and capex \\npicked up in 2011 and 2012 to 120% of the yearly depreciation booked in the P&L even \\nthough sales were flat. But the difficulties encountered by Indesit in 2013 (sales down by \\n8%, and the collapse of EBIT) hardly created a favourable environment for capex, which \\nis reduced to the same level as depreciation.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nA company’s working capital is the balance of the accounts directly related to its operating \\ncycle (essentially customer receivables, accounts payable and inventories). Calculated at \\nthe year-end closing date, it is not necessarily representative of the company’s permanent \\nrequirement. Therefore, you must look at how it has evolved over time.\\nAll of the components of working capital at a given point in time disappear shortly thereaf-\\nter. Inventories are consumed, suppliers are paid, and receivables are collected. But even if \\nthese components are consumed, paid and collected, they are replaced by others. Working \\ncapital is therefore both liquid and permanent.\\nWorking capital turnover ratios measure the average proportion of funds tied up in the oper-\\nating cycle. The principal ratios are:\\ntdays’ sales outstanding: accounts receivable/sales (incl. VAT) × 365;\\nt days’ payables outstanding: accounts payable/purchases (incl. VAT) × 365;\\nt days’ inventory outstanding: inventories and work in progress/sales (excl. VAT) × 365;\\nt working capital turnover: working capital/sales (excl. VAT) × 365.\\nWhen a company grows, its working capital has a tendency to grow because inventories and \\naccounts receivable (via payment terms) increase faster than sales. Paradoxically, working \\ncapital continues to grow during periods of recession because restrictive measures do not \\nimmediately deliver their desired effect. It is only at the end of the recession that working \\ncapital subsides and cash ﬂow problems ease.\\nA low or negative working capital is a boon to a company looking to expand.\\nThe level of working capital is an indication of the strength of the company’s strategic posi-\\ntion because it reﬂects the balance of power between the company and its customers and \\nsuppliers.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

Firstly, it invests to acquire land, buildings, equipment, etc. Secondly, it \\nmakes operating investments, specifically start-up costs and building up working capital.\\nTo ﬁnance these investments, the company must raise either equity or debt ﬁnancing. \\nThe investments, which initially generate negative cash ﬂows, must generate positive \\ncash ﬂows over time. After subtracting returns to the providers of the company’s ﬁnanc-\\ning (interest and dividends), as well as taxes, these cash ﬂows must enable the company \\nto repay its borrowings and eventually pay dividends.\\nIf the circle is a virtuous one, i.e. if the cash flows generated are enough to meet interest \\nand dividend payments and repay debt, the company will gradually be able to grow and, \\nas it repays its debt, it will be able to borrow more (the origin of the illusion that compa-\\nnies never repay their loans).\\nConversely, the circle becomes a vicious one if the company’s resources are con-\\nstantly tied up in new investments or if cash flow from operating activities is chronically \\nlow. The company systematically needs to borrow to finance capital expenditure, and it \\nmay never be able to pay off its debt, not to mention pay dividends.\\nEvaluating these matters is the dynamic approach.\\nt In parallel with the dynamic approach, you must look at the current state of the com-\\npany’s finances with two questions in mind:\\n○ Given the proportion of the company’s assets financed by bank and other finan-\\ncial debt and the free cash flow generated by the company, can the company repay \\nits debt?\\n○ Given the term structure of the company’s debt, is the company running a high \\nrisk of illiquidity?\\nThis is the static approach.'),\n",

Accordingly, it shows cash flows from operating \\nand investing activities and investments on the one hand, and from financing activities \\non the other. This breakdown will be very useful to you when valuing the company and \\nexamining investment decisions.\\nThe concept of cash flow from operating activities, as shown by the cash flow state-\\nment, is of the utmost importance. It depends on three fundamental parameters:\\ntthe rate of growth in the company’s business;\\nt the amount and nature of operating margins;\\nt the amount and nature of working capital.\\nAn analysis of the cash flow statement is therefore the logical extension of the analysis of \\nthe company’s margins and the changes in working capital.\\nAnalysing the cash flow statement means analysing the profitability of the company \\nfrom the point of view of its operating dynamics, rather than the value of its assets.\\nWe once analysed a fast-growing company with high working capital. Its cash flow \\nfrom operating activities was insufficient, but its inventories increased in value every year. \\nWe found that the company was turning a handsome net income, but its return on capital \\nemployed was poor, as most of its profit was made on capital gains on the value of its \\ninventories. Because of this, the company was very vulnerable to any recession in its \\nsector.\\nIn this case, we analysed the cash flow statement and were able to show that the \\ncompany’s trade activity was not profitable and that the capital gains just barely covered \\nits operating losses. It also became apparent that the company’s growth process led to \\nhuge borrowings, making the company even more vulnerable in the event of a recession.\\n2/ FREE CASH FLOW AFTER INTEREST\\nFree cash flow after interest is equal to cash flows from operating activities minus cash \\nflows from investments (capex net of disposal of fixed assets). It therefore includes the \\ninvestment policy of the firm.\\nFree cash flow after interest measures, if negative, the financial resources that the \\ncompany will have to find externally (from its shareholders or lenders) to meet the needs \\nfor cash generated by its operating and investment activities. If positive, the firm will be \\nable to reduce its debt, to pay dividends without having to raise debt or even to accumu-\\nlate cash for future needs. Free cash flow after interest will therefore set the tune for the \\nfinancing policy.'),\n",

New equity capital? New debt? Reinvesting cash flow from operating activi-\\nties? Asset disposals can contribute additional financial resources.\\nYou should focus on three items for this analysis: equity capital issues, debt policy \\nand dividend policy.\\ntFinancing through new equity issuance: did the firm call for new equity from its \\nshareholders during the period and, if yes, what was the use of it (to reduce debt, to \\nfinance a new capex programme)? You can also come across the opposite situation \\nwhereby the company buys back part of its shares; this is a way of returning cash \\nto shareholders.1 In this case, does the company want to alter its financial situation? \\nDoes it no longer have any investment opportunities?\\nt Financing through debt: analysing the net increase or decrease in the company’s debt \\nburden is a question of financial structure:\\n○ If the company is paying down debt, is it doing so in order to improve its financial \\nstructure? Has it run out of growth opportunities? Is it to pay back loans that were \\ncontracted when interest rates were high?\\n○ If the company is increasing its debt burden, is it taking advantage of unutilised \\ndebt capacity? Or is it financing a huge investment project or reducing its share-\\nholders’ equity and upsetting its financial equilibrium in the process?\\nt The dividend policy: as we will see in Chapter 37, the company’s dividend policy is \\nalso an important aspect of its financial policy. It is a valuable piece of information \\nwhen evaluating the company’s strategy during periods of growth or recession:\\n○ Is the company’s dividend policy consistent with its growth strategy?\\n○ Is the company’s cash flow reinvestment policy in line with its capital expenditure \\nprogramme?\\nYou must compare the amount of dividends with the investments and cash flows from \\noperating activities of the period. \\nIn Section III of this book, we will examine the more complex reasoning processes \\nthat go into determining investment and financing strategies. For the moment, keep in \\nmind that analysis of the financial statements alone can only result in elementary, com-\\nmon-sense rules.\\nAs you will see later, we stand firmly against the following “principles”:\\nt The amount of capital expenditure must be limited to the cash flow from operating \\nactivities. No! After reading Section III you will understand that the company should \\ncontinue to invest in new projects until their marginal profitability is equal to the \\nrequired rate of return.

This approach is diametrically \\nopposed to financial theory. It goes without saying, however, that you must determine the \\ninvestment cycle that the company’s financing cycle can support. In particular, debt repay-\\nment ability remains paramount. We have already warned you about that in Chapter 2!\\nSection 12.2\\nA STATIC ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY ’S FINANCING\\nFocusing on a multi-year period, we have examined how the company’s margins, working \\ncapital and capital expenditure programmes determine its various cash flows. We can now \\nturn our attention to the company’s absolute level of debt at a given point in time and to \\nits capacity to meet its commitments while avoiding liquidity crises.\\n1/ CAN THE COMPANY REPAY ITS DEBTS ?\\nThe best way to answer this simple, fundamental question is to take the company’s \\nbusiness plan and project future cash flow statements. These statements will show you \\nwhether the company generates enough cash flow from operating activities such that after \\nfinancing its capital expenditure, it has enough left over to meet its debt repayment obliga-\\ntions without asking shareholders to reach into their pockets. If the company must indeed \\nsolicit additional equity capital, you must evaluate the market’s appetite for such a capital \\nincrease. This will depend on who the current shareholders are. A company with a core \\nshareholder will have an easier time than one whose shares are widely held, as this core \\nshareholder, knowing the company well, may be in a position to underwrite the share \\nissue. It will also depend on the value of equity capital (if it is near zero, maybe only a \\nvulture fund3 will be interested).\\nNaturally, this assumes that you have access to the company’s business plan, or that \\nyou can construct your own from scenarios of business growth, margins, changes in work-\\ning capital and likely levels of capital expenditure. We will take a closer look at this \\napproach in Chapter 31.\\nAnalysts and lending banks have, in the meantime, adopted a “quick-and-dirty” way \\nto appreciate the company’s ability to repay its debt: the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. This \\nis, in fact, the most often used financial covenant4 in debt contracts! This highly empiri-\\ncal measure is nonetheless considered useful, because EBITDA is very close to cash flow \\nfrom operating activities, give or take changes in working capital, interest and income tax. \\nA value of 2.5 is considered a critical level, below which the company should generally be \\nable to meet its repayment obligations.\\nIf we were to oversimplify, we would say that a value of 2.5 signifies that the debt could \\nbe repaid in 2.5 years provided the company halted all capital expenditure and \\ndidn’t pay corporate income tax during that period. Of course, no one would ask the com-\\npany to pay off all its debt in the span of 2.5 years, but the idea is that it could if it had to.\\nConversely, bank and other financial borrowings equal to more than 2.5 times EBITDA \\nare considered a heavy debt load, and give rise to serious doubts about the company’s \\nability to meet its repayment commitments as scheduled. As we will see in Chapter 46, \\n3  An investment \\nfund that buys the \\ndebt of compa-\\nnies in difficulty \\nor subscribes \\nto equity issues \\nwith the aim of \\ntaking control of \\nthe company at a \\nvery low price.\\n4  Clause in \\ndebt contracts \\nrestricting the \\nfreedom of the \\nborrower until \\ndebt is above a \\ncertain level.

When the value of the ratio exceeds 5 or 6, the debt \\nbecomes “high-yield”, the politically correct term for “junk bonds”.\\nNaturally, these levels of ratios should be taken for what they are – indications and \\nnot absolute references. \\nBankers are more willing to lend money to sectors with stable and highly predict-\\nable cash flows (food retail, utilities, real estate), even on the basis of a high net debt to \\nEBITDA ratio, than to others where cash flows are more volatile (media, capital goods, \\nelectronics). Additionally, the lender will be sensitive to the effective capacity for gen-\\nerating cash flows. So, if past cash flow statements constantly show negative free cash \\nflows after financial expense, the banks will be very reluctant to lend, even if EBITDA is \\ncomfortable.\\nAccordingly, when changes in working capital are not negligible compared with the \\namount of EBITDA, the net debt/EBITDA ratio loses its relevance. \\nThe following table shows trends in the net debt/EBITDA ratio posted by various \\ndifferent sectors in Europe between 2000–2015e.\\nNET DEBT/EBITDA RATIO FOR LEADING LISTED EUROPEAN COMPANIES\\nSector 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014e 2015e\\nAerospace & Defence 1.2 0.8 0.2 0.6 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.2\\nAutomotive 0.7 0.3 nm nm nm nm nm nm\\nBuilding Materials 1.9 2.2 2.6 2.6 2.4 2.4 2.2 1.8\\nCapital Goods 1.2 0.7 0.6 1.0 1.1 1.1 0.9 0.6\\nConsumer Goods 1.7 0.1 nm 0.1 nm 0.1 nm nm\\nFood Retail 3.2 2.9 1.9 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.9 1.7\\nIT Services nm nm 0.0 0.4 0.1 nm nm nm\\nLuxury Goods 2.9 1.1 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 nm nm\\nMedia 2.3 1.0 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 0.6 0.3\\nMining 1.3 0.4 0.4 0.7 1.4 1.4 1.1 0.8\\nOil & Gas 0.6 0.4 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.8 0.8 0.8\\nPharmaceuticals nm 0.1 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.3 0.1\\nSteel 1.7 0.9 2.1 2.1 3.4 2.9 2.2 1.8\\nTelecom Operators 3.4 1.9 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.3 2.3 2.3\\nUtilities 2.5 2.0 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.9 2.7\\nSource: Exane BNP Paribas\\nFood retail and utilities are among the most highly leveraged sectors.

A ratio of 3:1 is consid-\\nered the critical level. Below this level, there are serious doubts as to the company’s abil-\\nity to meet its obligations as scheduled, as was the case for the transport sector post 9/11. \\nAbove it, the company’s lenders can sleep more easily at night!\\nRating agencies generally prefer to consider the ratio cash flow to net debt (they \\ncall our cash flow Funds From Operations or FFO). It is true that cash flow is closer than \\nEBITDA to the actual capacity of the firm to repay its debt.\\nUntil around 20 years ago, the company’s ability to repay its loans was evaluated \\non the basis of its debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, with a 1:1 ratio considered the critical \\npoint.\\nCertain companies can support bank and other financial debt in excess of share-\\nholders’ equity, specifically companies that generate high operating cash flow. EDF, the \\nFrench electricity operator which generates robust cash flows from its nuclear plants, is \\nan example. Conversely, other companies would be unable to support debt equivalent \\nto more than 30% of their equity, because their margins are very thin. For example, the \\noperating profit of Kuoni, the travel company, is, at best, only 3% of its sales revenue.\\nWe advise against using the debt-to-equity ratio as a measure of the company’s repay-\\nment capacity: shareholders’ equity capital serves to repay loans only in the event of \\nbankruptcy, not in the ordinary course of business.\\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is still computed by some analysts. It is an unfortunate illustration\\nof inertia of concepts in finance. \\nIf you insist on using equity to compute debt ratios, it is better to use the ratio of net \\ndebt divided by the market value of equity. Equity is thus taken into account for what it \\nis worth and not for a book amount which is, most of the time, far from economic reality. \\nNevertheless this ratio presents the drawback of being quite volatile.\\n2/ IS THE COMPANY RUNNING A RISK OF ILLIQUIDITY ?\\nTo understand the notion of liquidity, look at the company in the following manner: at \\na given point in time, the balance sheet shows the company’s assets and commitments. \\nThis is what the company has done in the past. Without planning for liquidation, we nev-\\nertheless attempt to classify the assets and commitments based on how quickly they are \\ntransformed into cash. When will a particular commitment result in a cash disbursement? \\nWhen will a particular asset translate into a cash receipt?\\nA company is illiquid when it can no longer meet its scheduled commitments.\\nTo meet its commitments, either the company has assets it can monetise or it must con-\\ntract new loans. Of course, new loans only postpone the day of reckoning until the new \\nrepayment date. By that time, the company will have to find new resources.\\nIlliquidity comes about when the maturity of the assets is greater than that of the \\nliabilities. Suppose you took out a loan, to be repaid in six months, to buy a machine \\nwith a useful life of three years. The useful life of the machine is out of step with the \\nscheduled repayment of the loan and the interest expenses on it. Consequently, there is a '),\n",

Similarly, at the current asset level, if you borrow \\nthree-month funds to finance inventories that turn over in more than three months, you are \\nrunning the same risk.\\nThe risk of illiquidity is the risk that assets will become liquid at a slower pace than \\nthe rate at which the liabilities will have to be paid, because the maturity of assets is \\nlonger. In a sense, liquidity measures the speed at which assets turn over compared with \\nliabilities.\\nAn illiquid company is not necessarily required to declare bankruptcy, but it must find \\nnew resources to bridge the gap. In so doing, it forfeits some of its independence because \\nit will be obliged to devote a portion of its new resources to past uses. In times of reces-\\nsion, it may have trouble doing so, and indeed be forced into bankruptcy.\\nAnalysing liquidity means analysing the risk the company will have to “borrow from \\nPeter to pay Paul”. For each maturity, you must compare the company’s cash needs with \\nthe resources it will have at its disposal.\\nWe say that a balance sheet is liquid when, for each maturity, there are more assets \\nbeing converted into cash (inventories sold, receivables paid, etc.) than there are liabilities \\ncoming due.\\nThis graph shows, for each maturity, the cumulative amount of assets and liabilities \\ncoming due on or before that date.\\nLiquidity\\nShareholders\\' equity\\n\"Margin of safety\"\\nLiabilities coming due\\n0\\nmaturity3 mos. 1 yr 2 yrs 5 yrs 10 yrs \\nCumulative amount with maturity smaller\\nthan .... \\nIf, for a given maturity, cumulative assets are less than cumulative liabilities, the company \\nwill be unable to meet its obligations unless it finds a new source of funds.

It is the same as the \\ncurrent ratio, except that inventories are excluded from the calculation. Using the \\nquick ratio is a way of recognising that a portion of inventories corresponds to the \\nminimum the company requires for its ongoing activity. As such, they are tantamount \\nto fixed assets. It also recognises that the company may not be able to liquidate the \\ninventories it has on hand quickly enough in the event of an urgent cash need. Certain \\ninventory items have value only to the extent they are used in the production process. \\nThe quick ratio (also called the acid test ratio) is calculated as follows:\\n \\nCurrent assets (less than one year) excluding inventories\\nCu\\n \\nrrrent liabilities (due in less than one year)\\nA quick ratio below 1 means the company might have short-term liquidity problems as it \\nowns less current assets than it owes to its short-term lenders. If the latter stop granting \\nit payment facilities, it will need a cash injection from shareholders or long-term lenders \\nor face bankruptcy.\\n t Finally, the cash ratio completes the set:\\n \\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCurrent liabilities (due in less tthan one year)\\nThe cash ratio is generally very low. Its fluctuations often do not lend themselves to easy \\ninterpretation.\\n(b) More on the current ratio\\nTraditional financial analysis relies on the following rule:\\nA company must maintain a buffer between sources and uses of funds maturing in less \\nthan one year to cover risks inherent in its business (loss of inventory value, custom-\\ners that fail to pay, decline in sales, business interruption costs that suddenly reduce \\nshareholders’ equity capital), because liabilities are not subject to such losses in value.\\nBy maintaining a current ratio above one (more current assets than current liabilities), the \\ncompany protects its creditors from uncertainties in the “gradual liquidation” of its cur-\\nrent assets, namely in the sale of its inventories and the collection of its receivables. These \\nuncertainties could otherwise prevent the company from honouring its obligations, such \\nas paying its suppliers, servicing bank loans or paying taxes.\\nIf we look at the long-term portion of the balance sheet, a current ratio above 1 means \\nthat sources of funds due in more than one year, which are considered to be stable, 5 are \\ngreater than fixed assets, i.e. uses of funds “maturing” in more than one year. If the current \\nratio is below 1, then fixed assets are being financed partially by short-term borrowings \\nor by a negative working capital. This situation can be dangerous. These sources of funds \\nare liabilities that will very shortly become due, whereas fixed assets “liquidate” only \\ngradually in the long term.\\n5  Also called \\n“permanent \\nfinancing”.

This was \\nclearly excessive. The current ratio reflects the choice between short-term and long-term \\nfinancing. In our view, this was a problem typical of the credit-based economy, as it \\nexisted in the 1970s in Continental Europe. Today, the choice is more between sharehold-\\ners’ equity capital and banking or financial debt, whatever its maturity. That said, we still \\nthink it is unhealthy to finance a permanent working capital with very short-term \\nresources. The company that does so will be defenceless in the event of a liquidity \\ncrisis, which could push it into bankruptcy.\\n(c) Financing working capital\\nTo the extent that working capital represents a permanent need, logic dictates that perma-\\nnent financing should finance it. Since it remains constant for a constant business volume, \\nwe are even tempted to say that it should be financed by shareholders’ equity. Indeed, \\ncompanies with high working capital are often largely funded by shareholders’ equity. \\nThis is the case, for example, with big champagne companies, which often turn to the \\ncapital markets for equity funding.\\nNevertheless, most companies would be in an unfavourable cash position if they \\nhad to finance their working capital strictly with long-term debt or shareholders’ equity. \\nInstead, they use the mechanism of revolving credits, which we will discuss in Chapter \\n21. For that matter, the fact that the components of working capital are self-renewing \\nencourages companies to use revolving credit facilities in which customer receivables and \\ninventories often collateralise the borrowings.\\nBy their nature, revolving credit facilities are always in effect, and their risk is often \\ntied directly to underlying transactions or collateralised by them (bill discounting, factor-\\ning, securitisation, etc.).\\nFull and permanent use of short-term revolving credit facilities can often be danger-\\nous, because it:\\ntexhausts borrowing capacity;\\nt inflates interest expense unnecessarily;\\nt increases the volume of relatively inflexible commitments, which will restrict the \\ncompany’s ability to stabilise or restructure its activity.\\nWorking capital is not only a question of financing. It can carry an operational risk as \\nwell. Short-term borrowing does not exempt the company from strategic analysis of how \\nits operating needs will change over time. This is a prerequisite to any financing strategy.\\nCompanies that export a high proportion of their sales or that participate in construc-\\ntion and public works projects are risky inasmuch as they often have insufficient share-\\nholders’ equity compared with their total working capital. The difference is often financed \\nby revolving credits, until one day, when the going gets rough . . .\\nIn sum, you must pay attention to the true nature of working capital, and understand \\nthat a short-term loan that finances permanent working capital cannot be repaid by the \\noperating cycle except by squeezing that cycle down, or in other words, by beginning to \\nliquidate the company.\\n(d) Companies with negative working capital\\nCompanies with a negative working capital raise a fundamental question for the financial \\nanalyst. Should they be allowed to reduce their shareholders’ equity on the strength of \\ntheir robust, positive cash position?'),\n",

This would seem to be an anomaly in financial the-\\nory. On the practical level, we can make two observations.\\nFirstly, under normal operating conditions, the company’s overall financing structure \\nis more important and more telling than the absolute value of its negative working capital.\\nLet’s look at companies A and B, whose balance sheets are as follows:\\nCompany A\\n800Shareholders’ equity 900Fixed assets \\n1100Net debt 1000Working capital \\nCompany B\\n100Shareholders’ equity 125Fixed assets \\n130Neg. working capital 105Cash & cash equiv. \\nMost of company A’s assets, in particular its working capital, are financed by debt. As a \\nresult, the company is much more vulnerable than company B, where the working capital \\nis well into negative territory and the fixed assets are mostly financed by shareholders’ \\nequity.\\nSecondly, a company with a negative working capital reacts much more quickly in \\ntimes of crisis, such as recession. Inertia, which hinders positive working capital compa-\\nnies, is not as great.\\nNevertheless, a negative working capital company runs two risks:\\nt The payment terms granted by its suppliers may suddenly change. This is a function \\nof the balance of power between the company and its supplier, and unless there is an \\noutside event, such as a change in the legislative environment, such risk is minimal. \\nOn the contrary, when a company with a negative working capital grows, its position \\nvis-à-vis its suppliers tends to improve. Nevertheless, the tendency (including regula-\\ntory) to reduce payment periods has a mechanically negative impact on firms with \\nnegative working capital.\\nt A contraction in the company’s business volume can put a serious dent in its finan-\\ncial structure. Already negative working capital becoming less and less negative will \\nprompt a cash drain on a company’s financial resources, pushing it into financial \\ndifficulties unless it is able to use its available cash, if any, or raise new debt.\\nSection 12.3\\nCASE STUDY : INDESIT 6\\nThe root-and-branch overhaul undertaken in 2009 brought cash flow from operations to a \\nhistoric high (€333m) whereas results were at a historic low.

If the company is to have an acceptable capacity to \\nmeet its repayment commitments as scheduled, the ratio should not be in excess of 4. \\nSimilarly, the EBIT/debt service ratio should be at least equal to 3.\\nt Is the company running the risk of being illiquid?

That said, you should take care not to change the method you \\ndecide to use as you go along so that comparisons over longer periods are not skewed. The \\noperating profit figure that should be used is the one we presented in Chapter 9, i.e. after \\nemployee profit-sharing, incentive payments and all the other revenues and charges that \\nare assigned to the operating cycle.\\nThese figures are calculated after tax, which means that we calculate return on capital \\nemployed after tax using the normal rate and not by deducting the actual income tax as it \\ntakes into account the financial structure, the financial interest being deductible.\\nAnalysts will have to decide for themselves whether, as we suggest here, they work on \\nan after-tax basis. If so, they will have to calculate operating proﬁt after theoretical \\ntax (calculated based on the company’s normalised tax rate), which is called NOPAT (net \\noperating proﬁt after tax).\\nReturn on capital employed can be calculated by combining a margin and turnover rate \\nas follows:\\nOperating profit after tax\\nCapital employed = Operating profitt after tax\\nSales\\nSales\\nCapital employed×\\nThe first ratio on the right-hand side – operating profit after tax/sales – corresponds \\nto the operating margin generated by the company, while the second – sales/capital \\nemployed – reflects asset turnover or capital turn (the inverse of capital intensity), which \\nindicates the amount of capital (capital employed) required to generate a given level of \\nsales. Consequently, a “normal” return on capital employed may result from weak mar-\\ngins, but high asset turnover (and thus low capital intensity), e.g. in mass retailing.

These uses of funds generate operating \\nprofit, which itself is apportioned between net financial expense (returns paid to debthold-\\ners) and net income attributable to shareholders.\\nIf we compare a company’s return on equity with its return on capital employed (after \\ntax to remain consistent), we note that the difference is due only to its financial structure, \\napart from non-recurring items and items specific to consolidated accounts which we will \\ndeal with later on.\\nBy deﬁnition, the leverage effect is the difference between return on equity and return \\non capital employed.\\nThe leverage effect explains how it is possible for a company to deliver a return on equity \\nexceeding the rate of return on all the capital invested in the business, i.e. its return on \\ncapital employed.\\nReaders should pause for a second to contemplate this corporate nirvana, which \\napparently consists in making more money than is actually generated by a company’s \\nindustrial and commercial activities.\\nBut before getting too carried away, readers should note that the leverage effect works \\nboth ways. Although it can lift a company’s return on equity above return on capital \\nemployed, it can also depress it, turning the dream into a nightmare.\\nThe leverage effect works as follows. When a company raises debt and invests the funds \\nit has borrowed in its industrial and commercial activities, it generates operating profit \\nthat normally exceeds the interest expense due on its borrowings. If this is not the case, \\nit is not worth investing, as we shall see at the beginning of Section II of this book. So, \\nthe company generates a surplus consisting of the difference between the return on capi-\\ntal employed and the cost of debt related to the borrowing. This surplus is attributable \\nto shareholders and is added to shareholders’ equity. The leverage effect of debt thus \\nincreases the return on equity. Hence its name.\\nLet’s consider a company with capital employed of 100, generating a return of 10% \\nafter tax, which is financed entirely by equity. Its return on capital employed and return \\non equity both stand at 10%.\\nIf the same company finances 30 of its capital employed with debt at an interest rate \\nof 4% after tax and the remainder with equity, its return on equity is:\\n  Operating proﬁt after tax: 10% × 100 =10\\n− Interest expense after tax:   4% × 30 =1.2\\n= Net income after tax:            =8.8\\nWhen divided by shareholders’ equity of 70 (100 – 30), this yields a return on equity after \\ntax of 12.6% (8.8/70), while the after-tax return on capital employed stands at 10%.\\nThe borrowing of 30 that is invested in capital employed generates operating profit \\nafter tax of 3 which, after post-tax interest expense (1.2), is fully attributable for an amount '),\n",

This surplus amount (1.8) is added to operating profit generated by \\nthe equity-financed investments (70 × 10% = 7) to give net income of 7 + 1.8 = 8.8. The \\ncompany’s return on equity now stands at 8.8/70 = 12.6%.\\nThe leverage effect of debt thus increases the company’s return on equity by 2.6%, or \\nthe surplus generated (1.8) divided by shareholders’ equity (1.8/70 = 2.6).\\nDebt can thus be used to boost a company’s return on equity without any change in \\nreturn on capital employed.\\nBut readers will surely have noticed the prerequisite for the return on equity to increase \\nwhen the company raises additional debt, i.e. its ROCE must be higher than its cost of \\ndebt. Otherwise, the company borrows at a higher rate than the returns it generates by \\ninvesting the borrowed funds in its capital employed. This gives rise to a deficit, which \\nreduces the rate of return generated by the company’s equity. Its earnings decline, and the \\nreturn on equity dips below its return on capital employed.\\nLet’s go back to our company and assume that its return on capital employed falls to \\n2% after tax. In this scenario, its return on equity is as follows:\\nWhen divided by shareholders’ equity of 70, this yields a return on equity after tax of \\n1.1% (0.8/70).\\nOnce invested in tangible assets or working capital, the borrowing of 30 generates an \\noperating profit after tax of 0.6 which, after deducting the 1.2 in interest charges, produces \\na deficit of 0.6 on the borrowed funds. This shortfall is thus deducted from net income, \\nwhich will drop to 70 × 2% − 0.6 = 0.8.\\nThe original return on capital employed of 2% is thus reduced by 0.6/70 = 0.9% to \\ngive a return on equity of 1.1% after tax.\\nWhen the return on capital employed falls below the cost of debt, the leverage effect \\nof debt shifts into reverse and reduces the return on equity, which in turn falls below \\nreturn on capital employed.\\n2/ FORMULATING AN EQUATION\\nBefore we go any further, we need to clarify the impact of tax on this line of reasoning.\\nTax reduces earnings. All revenues give rise to taxation and all charges serve to \\nreduce the tax bite (provided that the company is profitable). Consequently, each line \\nof the income statement can thus be regarded as giving rise to either tax expense or a \\ntheoretical tax credit, with the actual tax charge payable being the net amount of the tax \\nexpense and credits. We can thus calculate an operating profit figure net of tax, by simply \\nmultiplying the operating profit before tax by a factor of (1 – rate of corporate income tax).\\n  Operating proﬁt after tax: 100 × 2% =2\\n− Interest expense after tax:  30 × 4% =1.2\\n= Net income after tax:           =0.8'),\n",

Throughout this chap-\\nter, we have worked on an after-tax basis for all the key profit indicators, i.e. operating \\nprofit, net financial expense and net income (note that our reasoning would have been \\nidentical had we worked on a pre-tax basis).\\nLet’s now formulate an equation encapsulating our conclusions. Net income is equal \\nto the return on capital employed multiplied by shareholders’ equity plus a surplus (or \\ndeficit) arising on net debt, which is equal to the net debt multiplied by the difference \\nbetween the after-tax return on capital employed and the after-tax cost of debt.\\nTranslating this formula into a profitability rather than an earnings-based equation, \\nwe come up with the following:\\nReturn on\\nequity\\nReturn on\\ncapital employed\\n(after tax)\\nRetur\\n= +\\nnn on\\ncapital employed \\n(after tax)\\nAfter tax\\ncost \\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜\\n− oof\\ndebt\\nNet debt\\nShareholers’  equity\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟\\n×\\nor\\nROE = ROCE ROCE ) D\\nE+− ×( i\\nReaders should not let themselves get bogged down by this equation, which is based on \\nan accounting tautology. The leverage effect is merely a straightforward factor that is \\nused to account for return on equity, and nothing more.\\nThe ratio of net debt to shareholders’ equity is called financial leverage or gearing.\\nThe leverage effect can thus be expressed as follows:\\nNet debt\\nShareholders’equity Return on capital employed After-×−(t tax cost of debt)\\nReturn on equity is thus equal to the return on capital employed plus the leverage effect.\\nNote that:\\n t the higher the company’s return on capital employed relative to the cost of debt  \\n(e.g. if ROCE increases to 16% in our example, return on equity rises to  \\n16% × 5.1% = 21.1%); or\\n t the higher the company’s debt burden; the higher the leverage effect.\\nNaturally, the leverage effect goes into reverse once:\\n t return on capital employed falls below the cost of debt;\\n t the cost of debt is poorly forecast or suddenly soars because the company’s debt car-\\nries a variable rate and interest rates are on the rise.\\nThe leverage effect applies even when a company has negative net debt, i.e. when its \\nshort-term financial investments exceed the value of its debt. In such cases, return on \\nequity equates to the average of return on equity and return on short-term investments \\nweighted by shareholders’ equity and short-term investments.

Its shareholders’ equity \\nstood at £1195m and its net debt was a negative £385m, while its short-term financial \\ninvestments yielded 0.1% after tax. Its return on capital employed after applying an aver-\\nage tax rate of 26% stood at 42% based on its operating profit of £463m.2 Return on equity \\nthus stands at:\\nROE = (463+ 0.1% × 385) × (1 − 26% ) / 1195 \\n     = 42% − (42% − 0.1%) × −385 / 1195 = 28.5%\\nThe reason for Burberry’s ROE being lower than its ROCE is clearly not that the \\ngroup’s cost of debt is higher than its return on capital employed! To put things simply, \\nBurberry is unable to secure returns on the financial markets for its surplus cash on a par \\nwith those generated by its manufacturing facilities. Consequently, it has to invest the \\nfunds at a rate below its return on capital employed, thus depressing its return on equity.\\nThe following tables show trends in ROE and ROCE posted by various different sec-\\ntors in Europe over the 2000–2016 period.\\n2 463 ×\\n(1−26%)/\\n(1195−385) = \\n42%\\nSector 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014e 2015e\\nAerospace & Defence 8% 13% 13% 10% 15% 17% 17% 18%\\nAutomotive 9% 13% 12% 14% 11% 10% 12% 12%\\nBuilding Materials 20% 15% 14% 16% 16% 15% 15% 15%\\nCapital Goods 23% 11% 13% 15% 14% 14% 15% 15%\\nConsumer Goods 19% 17% 14% 14% 13% 12% 12% 13%\\nFood Retail 15% 13% 13% 13% 13% 12% 12% 12%\\nIT Services 14% 11% 11% 12% 12% 12% 14% 14%\\nLuxury Goods 13% 12% 14% 16% 18% 17% 16% 16%\\nMedia 5% 18% 18% 20% 20% 19% 20% 21%\\nMining 17% 29% 25% 21% 13% 13% 14% 15%\\nOil & Gas 21% 25% 15% 15% 14% 11% 11% 11%\\nPharmaceuticals 23% 22% 27% 27% 27% 24% 23% 23%\\nSteel 9% 21% 7% 4% −1% −1% 4% 6%\\nTelecom Operators 3% 13% 15% 15% 16% 11% 10% 11%\\nUtilities 11% 15% 12% 10% 11% 10% 9% 9%\\nROE FOR LISTED GROUPS (EUROPEAN GROUPS PER SECTOR)\\nSource: Exane BNP Paribas\\nThe reader may notice among other things the global improvement in ROCE since \\n2000 before it dropped again from 2008.

It is worth remembering that using profit before tax and non-recurring items \\nrather than net income eliminates the impact of non-recurring items.\\nBesides breaking down quasi-equity between debt and shareholders’ equity, provi-\\nsions between working capital and debt, etc., which we dealt with in Chapter 7, only two \\nconcrete problems arise when we calculate the leverage effect in consolidated financial \\nstatements: how to treat goodwill and associate companies.\\nThe way goodwill is treated (see Chapter 6) has a significant impact on the results \\nobtained. Setting off entire amounts of goodwill against shareholders’ equity as a result \\nof impairment tests causes a large chunk of capital employed and shareholders’ equity \\nto disappear from the balance sheet. As a result, the nominal returns on equity and on \\ncapital employed may look deceptively high when this type of merger accounting is used. \\nJust because whole chunks of capital appear to have vanished into thin air from a balance \\nsheet perspective does not mean that shareholders will give up their normal rate of return \\nrequirements on the capital that has done a perfectly legitimate disappearing act under \\naccounting standards. \\nConsequently, we recommend that readers should, wherever possible, work with \\ngross goodwill figures and add back to shareholders’ equity the difference between gross \\nand net goodwill to keep the balance sheet in equilibrium. 3 Likewise, we would advise \\nworking on the basis of operating profit and net profit before goodwill amortisation or \\nimpairment losses.\\n3 In the previous \\nexample involv-\\ning Indesit, this \\nadjustment was \\nmade as there \\nwas no goodwill \\nwritten down.'),\n",

They \\nobviously do not correspond to a portion of equity recovered by shareholders even if it \\nis no longer in the balance sheet. In an ideal world, the analyst should correct the book \\nequity of losses carried forward in the past. This is rarely done as the information is not \\nalways easily accessible.\\nConsolidated accounts present another problem, which is how income from asso-\\nciates4 should be treated . Should income from associates be considered as financial \\nincome or as a component of operating profit, bearing in mind that the latter approach \\nimplies adding an income after financial expense and tax to an operating profit (which is \\nbefore tax)?\\n t The rationale for considering income from associates as financial income is that it \\nequals the dividend that the group would receive if the associate company paid out \\n100% of its earnings. This first approach seems to fit a financial group that may sell \\none or another investment to reduce its debt.\\n t The rationale for considering income from associates as part of the operating profit is \\nthat income from associates derives from investments included in capital employed. \\nThis latter approach is geared more to an industrial group, for which such situations \\nshould be exceptional and temporary because the majority of industrial groups intend \\nto control more than 50% of their subsidiaries.\\n4/ COMPANIES  WITH  NEGATIVE  CAPITAL  EMPLOYED\\nCompanies with negative capital employed usually have high negative working capital \\nexceeding the size of their net fixed assets. This phenomenon is prevalent in certain spe-\\ncific sectors (contract catering, retailing, etc.) and this type of company typically posts a \\nvery high return on equity.\\nOf the two roles played by shareholders’ equity, i.e. ﬁnancing capital expenditure and \\nacting as a guarantee for lenders, the former is not required by companies with negative \\ncapital employed. Only the latter role remains.\\nConsequently, return on capital employed needs to be calculated taking into account \\nincome from short-term financial investments (included in earnings) and the size of these \\ninvestments (included in capital employed):\\nROCE = EBIT Financial income\\nCapital employed +Short-t\\n() ( ) +× − 1 Tc\\neerm financial investments\\nAs a matter of fact, companies in this situation factor their financial income into \\nthe selling price of their products and services. Consequently, it would not make sense \\nto calculate capital employed without taking short-term financial investments into \\naccount.\\n4 For more on \\nincome from \\nassociates, \\nsee page 75, \\nIn the Indesit \\ncase study, the \\nproblem was \\ndisregarded as \\nassociates’ book \\nvalue is close to \\n0 with marginal \\ncontribution to \\nresults.'),\n",

That said, they have much more limited appeal from a finan-\\ncial standpoint. The leverage effect equation always stands up to analysis, although some-\\ntimes some anomalous results are produced. For instance, the cost of debt calculated as \\nthe ratio of financial expense net of financial income to balance sheet debt may be plainly \\ntoo high or too low. This simply means that the net debt shown on the balance sheet does \\nnot reflect average debt over the year, that the company is in reality much more (or less) \\nindebted or that its debt is subject to seasonal fluctuations.\\nAttempts may be made to overcome this type of problem by using average or restated \\nfigures, particularly for fixed assets and shareholders’ equity. But this approach is really \\nfeasible only for internal analysts with sufficient data at their disposal.\\nIt is thus important not to set too much store by implicit interest rates or the \\ncorresponding leverage effect when they are clearly anomalous.\\nFor managers of a business or a profit centre, return on capital employed is one of \\nthe key performance and profitability indicators, particularly with the emergence of eco-\\nnomic profit indicators, which compare the return on capital employed with the weighted \\naverage cost of capital (see Chapter 27).\\nFrom a financial standpoint, however, book-based returns on capital employed and \\nreturns on equity hold very limited appeal. Since book returns are prepared from the \\naccounts, they do not reflect risks. As such, book returns should not be used in isolation \\nas an objective for the company because this will prompt managers to take extremely \\nunwise decisions.\\nAs we have seen, it is easy to boost book returns on equity by gearing up the balance \\nsheet and harnessing the leverage effect. The risk of the company is also increased with-\\nout being reflected in the accounting-based formula.\\nReturn on capital employed and return on equity are accounting indicators used for \\nhistorical analysis. In no circumstances whatsoever should they be used to project the \\nfuture rates of return required by shareholders or all providers of funds.\\nIf a company’s book profitability is very high, shareholders require a lot less and will \\nalready have adjusted their valuation of shareholders’ equity, whose market value is thus \\nmuch higher than its book value. If a company’s book profitability is very low, sharehold-\\ners want much more and will already have marked down the market value of sharehold-\\ners’ equity to well below its book value.5\\nIt is therefore essential to note that the book return on equity, return on capital \\nemployed and cost of debt do not reflect the rates of return required by shareholders, \\n5 For more on \\nthis  point, see \\nChapter 26.'),\n",

These returns cannot be considered as finan-\\ncial performance indicators because they do not take into account the two key concepts of \\nrisk and valuation. Instead, they belong to the domains of financial analysis and control. \\n2/ USES OF THE LEVERAGE EFFECT\\nCharacteristic of the 1960s, or present-day China, a strategy of “forging ahead regardless” \\nis particularly well-suited to periods of strong growth. This is a two-pronged strategy – \\nhigh levels of capital expenditure in order to increase the size of industrial facilities, and \\nlow margins in order to win market share and ensure that industrial facilities are fully \\nutilized. Obviously, return on capital employed is low (low margins and high capex), but \\nthe inevitable use of debt (the low margins lead to cash flows insufficient to finance the \\nhigh capex) makes it possible to swell the return on equity through the leverage effect. \\nMoreover, the real cost of debt is low or negative because of inflation. However, return on \\nequity is very unstable and it may decline suddenly when the growth rate of the activity \\nslows down. This was the strategy of Suntech, the Chinese world leader in solar panels, \\nwhich enabled it to take a lion’s share of its market, or as a consultant would put it, to \\nmove down its experience curve, but which was also the source of its collapse in 2013.\\nThe leverage effect sheds light on the origins of return on equity, i.e. whether it flows \\nfrom operating performance (i.e. a good return on capital employed) or from a favourable \\nfinancing structure harnessing the leverage effect. Our experience tells us that, in the long \\nterm, only an increasing return on capital employed guarantees a steady rise in a \\ncompany’s return on equity.\\nThe main point of the leverage effect is to show how return on equity breaks down \\nbetween the proﬁtability of a company’s industrial and commercial operations and its \\ncapital structure (i.e. the leverage effect).\\nAs we shall see in Section IV , the leverage effect is not very useful in finance because it \\ndoes not create any value except in two very special cases:\\ntin times of rising inflation, real interest rates (i.e. after inflation) are negative, thereby \\neroding the wealth of a company’s creditors who are repaid in a lender’s depreciating \\ncurrency to the great benefit of the shareholders;\\nt when companies have a very heavy debt burden (e.g. following an LBO, see Chapter \\n46), which obliges management to ensure that they perform well so that the cash \\nflows generated are sufficient to cover the heavy debt servicing costs. In this type of \\nsituation, the leverage effect gives management a very strong incentive to do well, \\nbecause the price of failure would be very high.\\nSection 13.4\\nCASE STUDY : INDESIT\\nOver the period, Indesit generates an average ROE of 10%, which is decent, with a tenth \\nof this rate being due to the leverage effect.'),\n",

Hence the search launched by the major shareholder to find a \\npartner which could help Indesit to improve its lot.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) is the book return generated by a company’s  \\noperations. It is calculated as operating proﬁt after normalised tax divided by capital \\nemployed or as the NOPAT margin (net operating proﬁt after tax/sales) multiplied by asset \\nturnover (sales/capital employed). Return on equity (ROE) is the ratio of net proﬁt to share-\\nholders’ equity.\\nThe leverage effect of debt is the difference between return on equity and return on capital \\nemployed. It derives from the difference between return on capital employed and the after-\\ntax cost of debt and is inﬂuenced by the relative size of debt and equity on the balance \\nsheet. From a mathematical standpoint, the leverage effect leads to the following accounting \\ntautology:\\nROE  ROCE  (ROCE )=+ × −i D\\nE\\nThe leverage effect works both ways. Although it may boost return on equity to above the \\nlevel of return on capital employed, it may also dilute it to a weaker level when the return \\non capital employed falls below the cost of debt.\\nBook return on capital employed, return on equity and cost of debt do not reﬂect the returns \\nrequired by shareholders, providers of funds and creditors. These ﬁgures cannot be regarded \\nas ﬁnancial indicators because they do not take into account risk or valuation, two key \\nparameters in ﬁnance. Instead, they reﬂect the historical book returns achieved and belong \\nto the realms of ﬁnancial analysis and control.\\nThe leverage effect helps to identify the source of a good return on equity, which may \\ncome from either a healthy return on capital employed or merely from a company’s  \\ncapital structure, i.e. the leverage effect. This is its only real point.\\nIn the long run, only a healthy return on capital employed will ensure a decent return  \\non equity. As we shall see, the leverage effect does not create any value. Although it  \\nmay boost return on equity, it leads to an increase in risk that is proportional to the  \\nadditional proﬁt.\\nSUMMARY\\n 1/  Why is capital employed equal to invested capital?\\n 2/  What is the leverage effect?\\n 3/  How is the leverage effect calculated?\\nQUESTIONS'),\n",

Here, \\noperating proﬁt includes income from associates, therefore to be consistent capital \\nemployed should include equity in associated companies. In any case, in our exam-\\nple, and given the small amounts, the difference between the ways of calculating \\nwould not be material.\\n◦ Whether to use recurring operating proﬁt or total operating proﬁt is another ques-\\ntion.

That is, will it be able to repay any loans it raised?\\nt Will it generate a higher rate of return than that required by those that have provided \\nit with funds? That is, will it be able to create value?\\nValue creation and solvency are obviously not without links. A firm that creates value \\nwill most often be solvent and a company will most likely be insolvent because it has not \\nsucceeded in creating value.\\nSection 14.1\\nSOLVENCY\\nHere we return to the concept that we first introduced in Chapter 4.\\nA company is solvent when it is able to honour all its commitments by liquidating all of \\nits assets, i.e. if it ceases its operations and puts all its assets up for sale.\\nSince, by definition, a company does not undertake to repay its shareholders, its \\nequity represents a kind of life raft that will help keep it above water in the event of liqui-\\ndation by absorbing any capital losses on assets and extraordinary losses.\\nSolvency thus depends on:\\nt the break-up value of a company’s assets;\\nt the size of its debts.\\nDo assets have a value that is independent of a company’s operations? The answer is prob-\\nably “yes” for the showroom of a carmaker on 5th Avenue in New York and probably “no” \\nas far as the tools and equipment at a heavy engineering plant are concerned.\\nIs there a secondary market for such assets? Here, the answer is affirmative for the \\nfleet of cars owned by a car rental company, but probably negative for the technical instal-\\nlations of a foundry. To put things another way, will a company’s assets fetch their book '),\n",

The second of these situations is the most common. It implies capital losses \\non top of liquidation costs (redundancy costs, etc.) that will eat into shareholders’ equity \\nand frequently push it into negative territory. In this case, lenders will be able to lay their \\nhands on only a portion of what they are owed. As a result, they suffer a capital loss.\\nThe solvency of a company thus depends on the level of shareholders’ equity restated \\nfrom a liquidation standpoint relative to the company’s commitments and the nature of \\nits business risks.\\nIf a company posts a loss, its solvency deteriorates signiﬁcantly owing to the resulting \\nreduction in shareholders’ equity and cumulative effects.\\nA loss-making company no longer benefits from the tax shield provided by debt. 1 As a \\nresult, it has to bear the full brunt of financial expense, which thus makes losses even \\ndeeper. Very frequently, companies raise additional debt to offset the decrease in their \\nequity. Additional debt then increases financial expense and exacerbates losses, giving \\nrise to the cumulative effects we referred to above.\\nIf we measure solvency using the debt/equity ratio, we note that a company’s sol-\\nvency deteriorates very rapidly in the event of a crisis.\\nLet’s consider a company with debt equal to its shareholders’ equity. The market \\nvalue of its debt and shareholders’ equity is equal to their book value because its return \\non capital employed is the same as its cost of capital of 10%.\\nAs a result of a crisis, the return on capital employed declines, leading to the follow-\\ning situation:\\n1 We disregard \\nthe impact of car-\\nrybacks here, i.e. \\ntax benefits which \\nmake it possible \\nto reduce cur-\\nrent tax liability \\nagainst the losses \\nof past periods.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5\\nBook value of capital employed\\n= Book value of equity\\n+ Net debt (costing 6%)\\n100\\n=50\\n+50\\n100\\n=50\\n+50\\n100\\n=47\\n+53\\n100\\n=34\\n+66\\n100\\n=25\\n+75\\n100\\n=25\\n+75\\nReturn on capital employed 10% 0% −10% −5% 5% 10%\\nOperating proﬁt after tax\\n−After-tax interest expense \\n(tax rate of 35%)\\n= Net income2\\n10\\n−2\\n=8\\n0\\n−3\\n=−3\\n−10\\n−3\\n=−13\\n−5\\n−4\\n=−9\\n5\\n−5\\n=0\\n10\\n−5\\n=5\\nMarket value of capital employed3\\n= Market value of equity\\n+ Market value of net debt\\n100\\n=50\\n+50\\n85\\n=38\\n+47\\n55\\n=15\\n+40\\n68\\n=18\\n+50\\n85\\n=25\\n+60\\n100\\n=30\\n+70\\n2 In year 0, since \\nthe company is \\nprofitable, finan-\\ncial expense is \\nonly 2 given the \\nincome tax rate \\nof 35% (rounded \\nfigures). In \\naddition, to keep \\nthings simple, it \\nis assumed that \\nthe entire amount \\nof net income \\nis paid out as a \\ndividend.\\n3 Market value \\nis observed \\nrather than \\ncalculated.\\nThe company’s evolution does not come as a surprise. The market value of capital \\nemployed falls by 45% at its lowest point because the previously normal return on capital \\nemployed turns negative. The market value of debt declines (from 100% to 75% of its \\nnominal value) since the risk of non-repayment increases with the decline in return on \\ncapital employed and the growing size of its debt. Lastly, the market value of shareholders’\\nequity collapses (by 70%).\\nEach year, the company has to increase its debt to cover the loss recorded in the \\nprevious year to keep its capital employed at the same level. From 1 at the start of our \\nmodel, gearing soars to 3 by the end of year 5. In this scenario, its equity gets smaller \\nand smaller, and its lenders will be very lucky to get their hands on the original amounts '),\n",

This scenario shows how debt can spiral in the event of a crisis! Some \\nrestructuring of equity and liabilities or, worse still, bankruptcy is bound to ensue with the \\nadditional losses caused by the disruption.\\nHad the same company been debt-free when the crisis began, its financial perfor-\\nmance would have been entirely different, as shown by the following table:\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5\\nBook value of capital employed\\n= Book value of equity\\n+ Net debt\\n100\\n=100\\n+0\\n100\\n=100\\n+0\\n100\\n=100\\n+0\\n100\\n=90\\n+10\\n100\\n=84\\n+16\\n100\\n=84\\n+16\\nReturn on capital employed 10% 0% −10% −5% 5% 10%\\nOperating proﬁt after tax\\n− After tax interest expense \\n(tax rate of 35%)\\n= Net income4\\n10\\n−0\\n=10\\n0\\n−0\\n=0\\n−10\\n−0\\n=−10\\n−5\\n−1\\n=−6\\n5\\n−1\\n=4\\n10\\n−1\\n=9\\nMarket value of capital employed5\\n= Market value of equity\\n+ Market value of net debt\\n100\\n=100\\n+0\\n85\\n=85\\n+0\\n55\\n=55\\n+0\\n68\\n=58\\n+10\\n84\\n=68\\n+16\\n100\\n=84\\n+16\\n4  To keep things \\nsimple, it is \\nassumed that the \\nentire amount \\nof net income \\nis paid out as a \\ndividend.\\n5 Market value \\nis observed \\nrather than \\ncalculated.\\nAt the end of year 4, the company returns to profit and its shareholders’ equity has been \\ndented only moderately by the crisis.\\nConsequently, the first company, which is comparable to the second in all respects \\nfrom an economic perspective, will not be able to secure financing and is thus probably \\ndoomed to failure as an independent economic entity.\\nFor a long time, net assets , i.e. the difference between assets and total liabilities \\nor assets net of debt, was the focal point for financial analysis. Net assets are thus an \\nindicator that corresponds to shareholders’ equity and are analysed in comparison to the \\ncompany’s total commitments.\\nSome financial analysts calculate net assets by subtracting goodwill (or even all intan-\\ngible fixed assets), adding back unrealised capital gains (which may not be accounted \\nfor owing to the conservatism principle), with inventories possibly being valued at their \\nreplacement cost.\\nBroadly speaking, calculating net assets is an even trickier task with consolidated \\naccounts owing to minority interests (which group assets do they own?) and goodwill \\n(what assets does it relate to and what value, if any, does it have?). Consequently, we \\nrecommend that readers should work using the individual accounts of the various enti-\\nties forming the group and then consolidate the net asset figures using the proportional \\nmethod.\\nSection 14.2\\nVALUE CREATION\\nA company will be able to create value during a given period if the return on capital \\nemployed (after tax) that it generates exceeds the cost of the capital (i.e. equity and net \\ndebt) that it has raised to finance capital employed.'),\n",

This \\nsubject is dealt with in Section III of this book. Chapter 26 covers the concept of value \\ncreation in greater depth, while Chapter 27 illustrates how it can be measured.\\nSection 14.3\\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS WITHOUT THE RELEVANT ACCOUNTING\\nDOCUMENTS\\nWhen a company’s accounting documents are not available in due time (less than three \\nmonths after year end), it is a sign that the business is in trouble. In many cases, the role \\nof an analyst will then be to assess the scale of a company’s losses to see whether it can \\nbe turned around or whether their size will doom it to failure.\\nIn this case, the analysts will attempt to establish what proportion of the company’s \\nloans the lenders can hope to recover. We saw in Chapter 5 that cash flow statements \\nestablish a vital link between net income and the net decrease in debt.\\nIt may perhaps surprise some readers to see that we have often used cash flow state-\\nments in reverse, i.e. to gauge the level of earnings by working back from the net decrease \\nin debt.\\nIt is essential to bear in mind the long period of time that may elapse before account-\\ning information becomes available for companies in difficulty. In addition to the usual \\ntime lag, the information systems of struggling companies may be deficient and take even \\nlonger to produce accounting statements, which are obsolete by the time they are pub-\\nlished because the company’s difficulties have worsened in the meantime.\\nConsequently, the cash flow statement is a particularly useful tool for making rapid \\nand timely assessments about the scale of a company’s losses, which is the crux of \\nthe matter.\\nIt is very easy to calculate the company’s net debt. The components of working capi-\\ntal are easily determined (receivables and payables can be estimated from the balances of \\ncustomer and supplier accounts, and inventories can be estimated based on a stock count). \\nCapital expenditure, increases in cash and asset disposals can also be established very \\nrapidly, even in a sub-par accounting system. We can thus prepare the cash flow statement \\nin reverse to give an estimate of earnings.\\nA reverse cash flow statement can be used to provide a very rough estimate of a com-\\npany’s earnings, even before they have been reported.\\nIn certain sectors,6 cash is probably a better proﬁtability indicator than earnings.\\nWhen cash starts declining and the fall is not attributable to either heavy capital expendi-\\nture that is not financed by debt capital or a capital increase, to the repayment of borrow-\\nings, to an exceptional dividend distribution or to a change in the business environment, \\nthe company is operating at a loss, whether or not this is concealed by overstating inven-\\ntories, reducing customer payment periods, etc.\\nIf the decrease in cash cannot be accounted for by investing or ﬁnancing activities, it \\ncan only come from deterioration in the company’s proﬁtability.\\n6  Like construc-\\ntion, defence.'),\n",

Yes, as it has equity of €465m and intangible \\nassets and goodwill of €340m. In addition, although the value of intangibles is always \\nquestionable, in the case of Indesit, the image of the group’s brands leads us to think that \\nthere is clearly value in the intangibles.\\nIs Indesit creating value? Certainly not with an after-tax return on capital employed \\nof 1.3%, Indesit provides investors with less than they require. Return on equity (0.6%) is \\nalso materially below the cost of equity (c.10%).\\nThis value destruction for the year 2013 is not reflected in the market capitalisation \\n(€1034m) being significantly above the book value of equity. The reason is the announce-\\nment by the controlling shareholder of its search for a partner, meaning that Indesit could \\nbe bought by a third party at a premium and/or a merger helping it to improve its lot. This \\ndestruction of value for 2013 is thus seen as temporary. \\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nBy the end of a ﬁnancial analysis, readers must be able to answer the two following questions \\nthat served as the starting point for their investigations:\\ntIs the company solvent? Will it be able to repay all its creditors in full?\\nt Is the company creating any value for its shareholders?\\nA company is solvent when it is able to honour all its commitments by liquidating all of its \\nassets, i.e. if it ceases its operations and puts all its assets up for sale. Net assets, i.e. the \\ndifference between assets and total liabilities, are the traditional measure of a company’s \\nsolvency.\\nA company creates value if the return on capital employed (after tax) that it generates \\nexceeds the cost of the capital (i.e. equity and net debt) that served to ﬁnance capital \\nemployed.\\nLastly, we recommend that readers who need to carry out a rapid assessment of an ailing \\ncompany where the accounts are not yet available build a cash ﬂow statement in reverse. This \\nreverse approach starts with reduction in net debt and works back towards net income, thus \\ngauging the scale of losses that put the company’s solvency and very survival in jeopardy.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/What risks do lenders run?

This section will analyse the behaviour of the investor who buys those instruments \\nthat the financial manager is trying to sell. An investor is free to buy a security or not and, \\nif he decides to buy it, he is then free to hold it or resell it in the secondary market.\\nThe financial investor seeks two types of returns: the risk-free interest rate (which \\nwe call the time value of money) and a reward for risk-taking. This section looks at these \\ntwo types of returns in detail but, first, here are some general observations about capital \\nmarkets.\\nSection 15.1\\nTHE RISE OF CAPITAL MARKETS\\nThe primary role of a financial system is to bring together economic agents with surplus \\nfinancial resources, such as households, and those with net financial needs, such as com-\\npanies and governments. This relationship is illustrated below:\\nSurplus of\\nresources Financial system Deficit of\\nresources\\nTo use the terminology of John Gurley and Edward Shaw (1960), the parties can be \\nbrought together directly or indirectly.\\nIn the first case, known as direct finance, the parties with excess financial resources \\ndirectly finance those with financial needs. The financial system serves as a broker,\\nmatching the supply of funds with the corresponding demand. This is what happens when \\nan individual shareholder subscribes to a listed company’s share issue or when a bank \\nplaces a corporate bond issue with individual investors.\\nIn the second case, or indirect finance, financial intermediaries, such as banks, buy \\n“securities” – i.e. loans – “issued” by companies. The banks in turn collect funds, in the \\nform of demand or savings deposits, or issue their own securities that they place with \\ninvestors. In this model, the financial system serves as a gatekeeper between suppliers and \\nusers of capital and performs the function of intermediation.'),\n",

Similarly, when you buy bonds issued by a financial institution, you enable \\nthe institution to finance the needs of other industrial and commercial enterprises through \\nloans. Lastly, when you buy an insurance policy, you and other investors pay premiums \\nthat the insurance company uses to invest in the bond market, the property market, etc.\\nThis activity is called intermediation, and is very different from the role of a mere \\nbroker in the direct finance model.\\nWith direct finance, the amounts that pass through the broker’s hands do not appear \\non its balance sheet, because all the broker does is to put the investor and issuer in direct \\ncontact with each other. Only brokerage fees and commissions appear on a brokerage \\nfirm’s profit and loss, or income, statement.\\nIn intermediation, the situation is very different.

Taking a page from the economist John Hicks, it is pos-\\nsible to speak of bank-based economies and market-based economies.\\nIn a bank-based economy, the capital market is underdeveloped and only a small \\nportion of corporate financing needs are met through the issuance of securities. Therefore, \\nbank financing predominates. Companies borrow heavily from banks, whose refinancing \\nneeds are mainly covered by the central bank.\\nThe central bank tends to have a strong influence on the level of investment, and con-\\nsequently on overall economic growth. In this scenario, interest rates represent the level \\ndesired by the government for reasons of economic policy, rather than an equilibrium \\npoint between supply and demand for loans.\\nA bank-based economy is viable only in an inflationary environment. When inflation \\nis high, companies readily take on debt because they will repay their loans with devalued \\ncurrency. In the meantime, after adjustments are made for inflation, companies pay real \\ninterest rates that are zero or negative. A company takes on considerable risk when it relies \\nexclusively on debt, although inflation mitigates this risk. Inflation makes it possible to \\nrun this risk and, indeed, it encourages companies to take on more debt. The bank-based \\n(or credit-based) economy and inflation are inextricably linked, but the system is flawed \\nbecause the real return to investors is zero or negative. Their savings are insufficiently \\nrewarded, particularly if they have invested in fixed-income vehicles.\\nThe savings rate in a credit-based economy is usually low. The savings that do exist \\ntypically flow into tangible assets and real property (purchase of houses, land, etc.) that \\nare reputed to offer protection against inflation. In this context, savings do not flow \\ntowards corporate needs. Lacking sufficient supply, the capital markets therefore remain \\nembryonic. As a result, companies can finance their needs only by borrowing from banks, \\nwhich in turn refinance themselves at the central bank. This process supports the inflation \\nnecessary to maintain a credit-based economy.\\nIn such a context it would be unreasonable for a corporate not to take on some debt. \\nIt is difficult to be wise when everybody else is behaving like a fool.\\nThe lender’s risk is that the corporate borrower will not generate enough cash flow \\nto service the debt and repay the principal, or amount of the loan. Even if the borrower’s \\nfinancial condition is weak, the bank will not be required to book a provision against the \\nloan so long as payments are made without incident.\\nIn an economy with no secondary market, the investor’s ﬁnancial risk lies with the cash \\nﬂows generated by his assets and their liquidity.\\nIn a market-based economy, companies cover most of their financing needs by issuing \\nfinancial securities (shares, bonds, commercial paper, etc.) directly to investors. A capi-\\ntal market economy is characterised by direct solicitation of investors’ funds. Economic \\nagents with surplus resources invest a large portion of their funds directly in the capital \\nmarkets by buying companies’ shares, bonds, commercial paper or other short-term nego-\\ntiable debt. They do this either directly or through mutual funds. Intermediation gives way \\nto the brokerage function, and the business model of financial institutions evolves towards \\nthe placement of companies’ securities directly with investors.\\nIn this economic model, bank loans are extended primarily to households in the form \\nof consumer credit, mortgage loans, etc., as well as to small- and medium-sized enter-\\nprises that do not have access to the capital markets.'),\n",

Slowly but surely, market forces tend to pervade all types of financial instruments.\\nFor example, with the rise of the commercial paper market, banks regularly index \\nshort-term loans on money-market rates. Medium- and long-term lending have seen simi-\\nlar trends. Meanwhile, on the liabilities side, banks have seen some of their traditional, \\nfixed-rate resources dry up. Consequently, the banks have had to step up their use of more \\nexpensive, market-rate sources of funds, such as certificates of deposit.1\\nSince the beginning of the 1980s, two trends have led to the rapid development of \\ncapital markets. First, real interest rates in the bond markets have turned positive. Sec-\\nond, budget deficits have been financed through the bond market, rather than through the \\nmoney market.\\nIn Chapter 1, the financial manager was described as a seller of financial securities. \\nThis is the result of European economies becoming capital market economies.\\nThe risks encountered in a capital market economy are very different from those in \\na credit-based economy. These risks are tied to the value of the security, rather than to \\nwhether cash flows are received as planned. During a stock market crash, for example, a \\ncompany’s share price might sink even though its published earnings exceed projections.\\nThe following graphs provide the best illustration of the rising importance of capital \\nmarkets.\\n1 Time deposits \\nrepresented by a \\ndematerialised\\nnegotiable debt \\nsecurity in the \\nform of a bearer \\ncertificate.\\n45% 44%\\n33% 30% 33%\\n18% 16%\\n14% 19% 21%\\n14% 20%\\n21% 25% 24%\\n23% 20%\\n32% 26% 22%\\n1980 1990 2000 2010 2012\\nBank financing\\nPrivate DebtEquity\\nGovernment Debt\\nCapital financing market\\nBank and capital market financing\\nSource: McKinsey & Company 2013'),\n",

A financial system allows investors to \\nconvert current revenues into future consumption. It also provides current resources for \\nborrowers, at the cost of reduced future spending.\\nRobert Merton and Zvi Bodie have isolated six essential functions  of a financial \\nsystem:\\n1. means of payment;\\n2. financing;\\n3. saving and borrowing;\\n4. risk management;\\n5. information;\\n6. reducing or resolving conflict.\\n1. A financial system provides means of payment to facilitate transactions .\\nCheques, debit and credit cards, electronic transfers, etc. are all means of payment that \\nindividuals can use to facilitate the acquisition of goods and services. Imagine if every-\\nthing could only be paid for with bills and coins!\\n2. A financial system provides a means of pooling funds for financing large, indi-\\nvisible projects. A financial system is also a mechanism for subdividing the capital of \\na company so that investors can diversify their investments. If factory owners had to \\nrely on just their own savings, they would very soon run out of investible funds. Indeed, \\nwithout a financial system’s support, Nestlé and British Telecom would not exist. The \\nsystem enables the entrepreneur to gain access to the savings of millions of individuals, \\nShares Bonds\\n0\\n20,000\\n40,000\\n60,000\\n80,000\\n100,000\\n120,000\\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\\nVolume of trades on stock exchanges in the world (in US$ bn)\\nSource: World Federation of Exchange members\\ntransaction \\nvolumes are linked \\nto the economic \\nenvironment, \\neven if the \\nlong-term trend \\nshows a clear \\nincrease.'),\n",

In return, the entrepreneur is \\nexpected to achieve a certain level of performance. Returning to our example of a factory, \\nif you were to invest in your neighbour’s steel plant, you might have trouble getting your \\nmoney back if you should suddenly need it. A financial system enables investors to hold \\ntheir assets in a much more liquid form: shares, bank accounts, etc.\\n3. A financial system distributes financial resources across time and space, as \\nwell as between different sectors of the economy. The financial system allows capital to \\nbe allocated in a myriad of ways. For example, young married couples can borrow to buy \\na house or people approaching retirement can save to offset future decreases in income. \\nEven a developing nation can obtain resources to finance further development. And when \\nan industrialised country generates more savings than it can absorb, it invests those sur-\\npluses through financial systems. In this way, “old economies” use their excess resources \\nto finance “new economies”.\\n4. A financial system provides tools for managing risk . It is particularly risky \\nfor an individual to invest all of his funds in a single company because, if the company \\ngoes bankrupt, he loses everything. By creating collective savings vehicles, such as \\nmutual funds, brokers and other intermediaries enable individuals to reduce their risk \\nby diversifying their exposure. Similarly, an insurance company pools the risk of millions\\nof people and insures them against risks they would otherwise be unable to assume \\nindividually.\\n5. A financial system provides price information at very low cost. This facilitates \\ndecentralised decision-making . Asset prices and interest rates constitute information \\nused by individuals in their decisions about how to consume, save or divide their funds \\namong different assets. But research and analysis of the available information on the \\nfinancial condition of the borrower is time-consuming, costly and typically beyond the \\nscope of the layperson. Yet when a financial institution does this work on behalf of thou-\\nsands of investors, the cost is greatly reduced.\\n6. A financial system provides the means for reducing conflict between the \\nparties to a contract . Contracting parties often have difficulty monitoring each other’s \\nbehaviour. Sometimes conflicts arise because each party has different amounts of infor-\\nmation and divergent contractual ties. For example, an investor gives money to a fund \\nmanager in the hope that he will manage the funds in the investor’s best interests (and not \\nhis own!). If the fund manager does not uphold his end of the bargain, the market will \\nlose confidence in him. Typically, the consequence of such behaviour is that he will be \\nreplaced by a more conscientious manager.\\nSection 15.3\\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANKS AND COMPANIES\\nNot so long ago, banks could be classified as:\\ntCommercial banks that schematically collected funds from individuals and lent to \\ncorporates.\\nt Investment banks that provided advisory services (mergers and acquisitions, wealth \\nmanagement) and played the role of a broker (placement of shares, of bonds) but \\nwithout “using their balance sheet”.'),\n",

This resulted from mega-mergers between commercial banks and investment \\nbanks: BNP/Paribas, Citicorp/Travelers Group, Chase Manhattan/JP Morgan and, more \\nrecently, Merrill Lynch/Bank of America.\\nThis trend, eased by changes in regulation (in particular in the US with the reform \\nof the Glass–Steagall Act in 1999), shows a willingness of large banking groups to adopt \\nthe business model of a universal bank (also called “one-stop shopping”) in a context of \\nincreasing internationalisation and complexity. This is particularly true for certain busi-\\nness lines like corporate finance or fund management, in which size constitutes a real \\ncompetitive advantage.\\nFollowing the financial crisis, there emerged a certain political willingness to split \\nup large banking groups again, specifically in order to separate deposits from market-\\nrelated activities. This idea (not only guided by the protection of households’ deposits) \\nhas materialised in laws (US, France) aimed mainly at confining speculative operations \\nand avoiding market activities that impact negatively on deposits. \\nLarge banking groups now generally include the following business lines:\\nt Retail banking : for individuals and small- and medium-sized corporates. Retail \\nbanks serve as intermediaries between those who have surplus funds and those who \\nrequire financing. The banks collect resources from the former and lend capital to \\nthe latter. They have millions of clients and therefore adopt an industrial organisa-\\ntion. The larger the bank’s portfolio, the lower the risk – thanks once again to the law \\nof large numbers. Retail banking is an extremely competitive activity. After taking \\ninto account the cost of risk, profit margins are very thin. Bank loans are some-\\nwhat standard products, so it is relatively easy for customers to play one bank off \\nagainst another to obtain more favourable terms. Retail banks have developed ancil-\\nlary services to add value to the products that they offer to their corporate customers. \\nAccordingly, they offer a variety of means of payment to help companies move funds \\nefficiently from one place to another. They also help clients to manage their cash \\nflows (see Chapter 49) or their short-term investments. A retail banking division also \\ngenerally includes some specific financial services for individuals (e.g. consumer \\ncredit) or for corporates (factoring, leasing, etc.) as such services are used mostly by \\nsmall- and medium-sized firms.\\nt Corporate and investment banking (CIB): provides large corporates with sophisti-\\ncated services. Such banks have, at most, a few thousand clients and offer primarily \\nthe following services:\\n○ Access to equity markets (Equity Capital Markets, ECM) : investment banks \\nhelp companies prepare and carry out initial public offerings on the stock market. \\nLater on, investment banks can continue to help these companies by raising addi-\\ntional funds through capital increases. They also advise companies on the issu-\\nance of instruments that may one day become shares of stock, such as warrants \\nand convertible bonds (see Chapter 24).\\n○ Access to bond markets (Debt Capital Markets, DCM): similarly, investment \\nbanks help large- and medium-sized companies raise funds directly from inves-\\ntors through the issuance of bonds. The techniques of placing securities, and in \\nparticular the role of the investment bank in this type of transaction, will be dis-\\ncussed in Chapter 25. The investment bank’s trading room is where its role as \\n“matchmaker” between the investor and the issuer takes on its full meaning.'),\n",

The bank also uses these desks for speculating for its own account.\\nt Asset management banking : has its own clients – institutional investors and high \\nnet worth individuals – but also serves some of the retail banking clients through \\nmutual funds. The asset management arm may sometimes use some of the products \\ntailored by the investment banking division (hedging, order execution).\\nBesides these global banking groups operating across all banking activities, some players \\nhave focused on certain targeted services like mergers and acquisitions and asset manage-\\nment (Lazard and Rothschild, for example) or specific geographical areas (Mediobanca \\nand Lloyds Bank, for example).\\nThe 2008 crisis demonstrated the central role played by banks in the economy. \\nThey are suppliers of liquidity; they are also an indicator of investor risk aversion. The \\nbasic duty of a bank is to assess risk and repackage it while eliminating the diversifiable \\nrisk. Whatever their business model, the worst-managed players have been hit: Northern \\nRock, Fortis, Wachovia for retail banks; Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers for investment \\nbanks; Citi for universal banks. There does not seem to be a better business model – some \\nplayers are just better managed than others.\\nSection 15.4\\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK : EFFICIENT MARKETS\\nAn efﬁcient market is one in which the prices of ﬁnancial securities at any time rapidly \\nreﬂect all available relevant information. The terms “perfect market” or “market in \\nequilibrium” are synonymous with “efﬁcient market” .\\nIn an efficient market, prices instantly reflect the consequences of past events and all \\nexpectations about future events. As all known factors are already integrated into current \\nprices, it is therefore impossible to predict future variations in the price of a financial \\ninstrument. Only new information will change the value of the security. Future informa-\\ntion is, by definition, unpredictable, so changes in the price of a security are random. This \\nis the origin of the random walk character of returns in the securities markets.\\nCompetition between financial investors is so fierce that prices adjust to new infor-\\nmation almost instantaneously. At every moment, a financial instrument trades at a price \\ndetermined by its return and its risk.\\nEugene Fama (1970) has developed the following three tests to determine whether a \\nmarket is efficient:\\ntAbility to predict prices\\nt Market response to specific events\\nt Impact of insider information on the market'),\n",

Existing prices \\nalready reflect all the information that can be gleaned from studying past prices  and \\ntrading volumes. The efficient market hypothesis says that technical analysis has no \\npractical value, nor do martingales (martingales in the ordinary, not mathematical, sense). \\nFor example, the notion that “if a stock rises three consecutive times, buy it; if it declines \\ntwo consecutive times, sell it” is irrelevant. Similarly, the efficient market hypothesis says \\nthat models relating future returns to interest rates, dividend yields, the spread between \\nshort- and long-term interest rates or other parameters are equally worthless.\\nA semi-strong efficient market reflects all publicly available information, as found \\nin annual reports, newspaper and magazine articles, prospectuses, announcements of \\nnew contracts, of a merger, of an increase in the dividend, etc. This hypothesis can be \\nempirically tested by studying the reaction of market prices to company events (event \\nstudies). In fact, the price of a stock reacts immediately to any announcement of rel-\\nevant new information regarding a company. In an efficient market, no impact should \\nbe observable prior to the announcement, nor during the days following the announce-\\nment. In other words, prices should adjust rapidly only at the time any new information \\nis announced.\\n0\\n1,000\\n2,000\\n3,000\\n4,000\\n5,000\\n6,000\\n7 ,000\\n8,000\\n9,000\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n12\\n12 13 14 15 16 17 20 21 22 23 24 25 28\\nUbisoft share price variations in October 2013\\nVolumes traded Ubisoft share price Rescaled share market index (SBF 120)\\nShare price (€) Volumes ('000 shares)16-Oct-2013:\\nUbisoft announced that the\\nWatchdog's release has been\\ndelayed until 2014\\nSource: Datastream\\nOn October 16th \\n2013, before \\nmarket opening, \\nUbisoft announced \\nit had postponed \\nby several months \\nthe release of the \\nnew version of its \\nblockbuster video \\ngame Watchdog.\\nUbisoft’s share \\nprice immediately \\ncollapsed by 24% \\nwith a very high \\nlevel of shares \\ntraded.\\nIn order to prevent investors with prior access to information from using it to their \\nadvantage (and therefore to the detriment of other investors), most stock market regula-\\ntors suspend trading prior to a mid-session announcement of information that is highly \\nlikely to have a significant impact on the share price. Trading resumes a few hours later or \\nthe following day so as to ensure that all interested parties receive the information. Then, \\nwhen trading resumes, no investor has been short-changed.\\nIn a strongly efficient financial market, investors with privileged or insider informa-\\ntion or with a monopoly on certain information are unable to influence securities prices. \\nThis holds true only when financial market regulators have the power to prohibit and pun-\\nish the use of insider information.\"),\n",

However, without \\nusing any inside information, the efficient market hypothesis says that market experts \\nhave no edge over the layman. In fact, in an efficient market, the experts’ performance \\nis slightly below the market average, in a proportion directly related to the management \\nfees they charge!\\nActual markets approach the theory of an efficient market when:\\nt participants have low-cost access to all information;\\nt transaction costs are low;\\nt the market is liquid; and\\nt investors are rational.\\nTake the example of a stock whose price is expected to rise 10% tomorrow. In an efficient \\nmarket, its price will rise today to a level consistent with the expected gain. “Tomor-\\nrow’s” price will be discounted to today. Today’s price becomes an estimate of the value \\nof tomorrow’s price.\\nIn general, if we try to explain why financial markets have different degrees of \\nefficiency, we could say that:\\ntThe lower transaction costs are, the more efficient a market is. An efficient market \\nmust quickly allow equilibrium between supply and demand to be established. Trans-\\naction costs are a key factor in enabling supply and demand for securities and capital \\nto adjust.\\nBrokerage fees have an impact on how quickly a market reaches equilibrium. In \\nan efficient market, transactions have no costs associated with them, neither under-\\nwriting costs (when securities are issued) nor trading costs (when securities are \\nbought and sold).\\nWhen other transaction-related factors are introduced, such as the time required \\nfor approving and publishing information, they can slow down the achievement of \\nmarket equilibrium.\\nt The more liquid a market is, the more efficient it is. The more frequently a security \\nis traded, the more quickly new information can be integrated into the share price. \\nConversely, illiquid securities are relatively slow in reflecting available information. \\nInvestors cannot benefit from the delays in information assimilation because the trad-\\ning and transaction volumes are low.\\nResearch into the significance of this phenomenon has demonstrated that there \\nis a statistical relationship between liquidity and the required rate of return. This \\nindicates the existence of a risk premium that varies inversely with the liquidity of \\nthe security. The premium is tantamount to a reward for putting up with illiquidity, \\ni.e. when the market is not functioning efficiently. We will measure the size of this \\npremium in Chapter 19.\\nt The more rational investors are, the more efficient a market is . Individuals \\nare said to be rational when their actions are consistent with the information they \\nreceive. When good and unexpected news is announced, rational investors must buy a \\nstock – not sell it. And for any given level of risk, rational investors must also try to \\nmaximise their potential gain.'),\n",

It is probably the most tested assumption of finance! A number of \\n“anomalies” that go against the efficiency of markets have been highlighted:\\ntExcess volatility. The first issue with efficient market theory seems very intuitive: \\nhow can markets be so volatile? Information on Alcatel-Lucent is not published every \\nsecond. Nevertheless, the share price does move at each instant. There seems to be \\nsome kind of noise around fundamental value. As described by Benoit Mandelbrot, \\nwho first used fractals in economics, prices evolve in a discrete way rather than in a \\ncontinuous manner.\\nt Dual listing and closed-end funds. Dual listings are shares of twin companies listed \\non two different markets. Their stream of dividends is, by definition, identical but we \\ncan observe that their price can differ over a long period of time. Similarly the price \\nof a closed-end fund (made up of shares of listed companies) can differ from the \\nsum of the value of its components. Conglomerate discount (see Chapter 41) cannot \\nexplain the magnitude of the discount for certain funds and certainly not the premium \\nfor some others. It is interesting to see that these discounts can prevail over a long \\nperiod of time, therefore making any arbitrage (although easy to conceptualise) hard \\nto put in place.\\nt Calendar anomalies. Stocks seem to perform less well on Mondays than on other \\ndays of the week and provide higher returns in the month of January compared to \\nother months of the year (in particular for small- and medium-sized enterprises). \\nNevertheless, these calendar anomalies are not material enough to allow for sys-\\ntematic and profitable arbitrage given transaction costs. For each of these observa-\\ntions, some justifications consistent with rationality of investor behaviour can be put \\nforward.\\nt Meteorological anomalies. There is consistent observation that stock prices perform \\nbetter when the sun shines than when it rains. There again, although statistically sig-\\nnificant, these anomalies are not material enough to generate arbitrage opportunities.\\nThere seem to be some grounds to think that the efficient market theory is not valid. Nev-\\nertheless, Eugene Fama, one of the founders of this theory, defends it strongly. He calls \\ninto question the methodologies used to find anomalies (in particular for the overreaction \\nof markets).\\nBehavioural finance rejects the founding assumption of market efficiency: what if \\ninvestors were not rational? It tries to build on other fields of social science to derive new \\nconclusions. For example, economists will work with neuroscientists to understand indi-\\nvidual economic choices. Finance researchers will be helped by psychologists to under-\\nstand the actual behaviour of investors when they make an investment choice. This allows \\nus to suppose that decisions are influenced by circumstances and the environment.\\nOne of the first tests for understanding people’s reasoning to make a choice is based \\non lotteries (gains with certain probabilities). The following attitudes can be observed:'),\n",

This may generate some paradoxes: pre-\\nferring BNP Paribas to UBS, UBS to Mediobanca but Mediobanca to BNP Paribas! \\nThis could drive an asset manager mad!\\nThe lack of rationality of some investors would not be a problem if arbitrage made it pos-\\nsible to correct anomalies and if efficiency could be brought back rapidly. Unfortunately, \\nanomalies can be observed over the long term.\\nThe theory of mimicry is an illustration of behavioural finance. The economist André \\nOrléan has distinguished three types of mimicry:\\ntNormative mimicry  – which could also be called “conformism”. Its impact on \\nfinance is limited and is beyond the scope of this text.\\nt Informational mimicry – which consists of imitating others because they supposedly \\nknow more. It constitutes a rational response to a problem of dissemination of infor-\\nmation, provided the proportion of imitators in the group is not too high. Otherwise, \\neven if it is not in line with objective economic data, imitation reinforces the most \\npopular choice, which can then interfere with efficient dissemination of information.\\nt Self-mimicry – which attempts to predict the behaviour of the majority in order \\nto imitate it. The “right” decision then depends on the collective behaviour of all \\nother market participants and can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, i.e. an equilib-\\nrium that exists because everyone thinks it will exist. This behaviour departs from \\ntraditional economic analysis, which holds that financial value results from real \\neconomic value.\\nMimicry can explain speculative bubbles.\\nMimetic phenomena can be accentuated by program trading, which involves the com-\\nputer programs used by some traders that rely on pre-programmed buy or sell decisions. \\nThese programs can schedule liquidating a position (i.e. selling an investment) if the loss \\nexceeds a certain level. A practical issue with such programs was illustrated on 6 May \\n2010 by the flash crash of the Dow Jones which lost 9% in five minutes before recovering \\nthis loss 20 minutes later.\\nIt is easy to criticise but harder to conclude. If some want to destroy efficient market \\ntheory (which implies no more CAPM or method to value financial products, etc.) they \\nwill have to propose a viable alternative. As of today, the models proposed by “behav-\\niouralists” cannot be used (especially in corporate finance), they merely model the behav-\\niour of investors towards investment decisions and products.\\nWe can anticipate that in the future the theoretical framework of ﬁnance will mix the \\nrigorous approach of neoclassical theories (including the efﬁcient market theory) with \\nthe more realistic understanding of the decision process of investors that behavioural \\nﬁnance will provide.'),\n",

The term “to hedge” describes a general concept that underlies \\ncertain investment decisions, for example, the decision to match a long-term investment \\nwith long-term financing, to finance a risky industrial investment with equity rather than \\ndebt, etc.\\nThis is simple, natural and healthy behaviour for non-financial managers. Hedging\\nprotects a manufacturing company’s margin, i.e. the difference between revenue and \\nexpenses, from uncertainties in areas relating to technical expertise, human resources, \\nsales and marketing, etc. Hedging allows the economic value of a project or line of busi-\\nness to be managed independently of fluctuations in the capital markets.\\nAccordingly, a European company that exports products to the United States may \\nsell dollars forward against euros, guaranteeing itself a fixed exchange rate for its future \\ndollar-denominated revenues. The company is then said to have hedged its exposure to \\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nAn investor hedges when he does not wish to assume a calculated risk.\\n2/ SPECULATION\\nIn contrast to hedging, which eliminates risk by transferring it to a party willing to assume \\nit, speculation is the assumption of risk. A speculator takes a position when he makes a \\nbet on the future value of an asset. If he thinks its price will rise, he buys it. If it rises, he \\nwins the bet; if not, he loses. If he is to receive dollars in a month’s time, he may take no \\naction now because he thinks the dollar will rise in value between now and then. If he has \\nlong-term investments to make, he may finance them with short-term funds because he \\nthinks that interest rates will decline in the meantime and he will be able to refinance at \\nlower cost later. This behaviour is diametrically opposed to that of the hedger.\\ntTraders are professional speculators. They spend their time buying currencies, bonds, \\nshares or options that they think will appreciate in value and they sell them when they \\nthink they are about to decline. Not surprisingly their motto is “Buy low, sell high, \\nplay golf!”\\nt But the investor is also a speculator most of the time . When an investor predicts \\ncash flows, he is speculating about the future. This is a very important point, and you \\nmust be careful not to interpret “speculation” negatively. Every investor speculates \\nwhen he invests, but his speculation is not necessarily reckless. It is founded on a '),\n",

The only difference is \\nthat some investors speculate more heavily than others by assuming more risk.\\nPeople often criticise the financial markets for allowing speculation. Yet speculators play \\na fundamental role in the market, an economically healthy role, by assuming the risks that \\nother participants do not want to accept. In this way, speculators minimise the risk borne \\nby others.\\nAccordingly, a European manufacturing company with outstanding dollar-denomi-\\nnated debt that wants to protect itself against exchange rate risk (i.e. a rise in the value \\nof the dollar vs. the euro) can transfer this risk by buying dollars forward from a specu-\\nlator willing to take that risk. By buying dollars forward today, the company knows the \\nexact dollar/euro exchange rate at which it will repay its loan. It has thus eliminated its \\nexchange rate risk. Conversely, the speculator runs the risk of a fluctuation in the value of \\nthe dollar between the time he sells the dollars forward to the company and the time he \\ndelivers them, i.e. when the company’s loan comes due.\\nLikewise, if a market’s long-term financing needs are not satisfied, but there is a \\nsurplus of short-term savings, sooner or later a speculator will (fortunately) come along \\nand assume the risk of borrowing short term in order to lend long term. In so doing, the \\nspeculator assumes intermediation risk.\\nSpeculative bubbles are isolated events that should not put into question the utility and \\nnormal operation of the ﬁnancial markets.\\nWhat, then, do people mean by a “speculative market”? A speculative market is a mar-\\nket in which all the participants are speculators. Market forces, divorced from economic \\nreality, become self-sustaining because everyone is under the influence of the same \\nphenomenon. Once a sufficient number of speculators think that a stock will rise, their \\npurchases alone are enough to make the stock price rise. Their example prompts other \\nspeculators to follow suit, the price rises further, and so on. But at the first hint of a down-\\nward revision in expectations, the mechanism goes into reverse and the share price falls \\ndramatically. When this happens, many speculators will try to liquidate positions in order \\nto pay off loans contracted to buy shares in the first place, thereby further accentuating \\nthe downfall.\\n3/ ARBITRAGE\\nIn contrast to the speculator, the arbitrageur is not in the business of assuming risk. \\nInstead, he tries to earn a profit by exploiting tiny discrepancies which may appear on \\ndifferent markets that are not in equilibrium.\\nAn arbitrageur will notice that Solvay shares are trading slightly lower in London \\nthan in Brussels. He will buy Solvay shares in London and sell them simultaneously (or \\nnearly so) at a higher price in Brussels. By buying in London, the arbitrageur bids the \\nprice up in London; by selling them in Brussels, he drives the price down there. He or \\nother arbitrageurs then repeat the process until the prices in the two markets are perfectly \\nin line, or in equilibrium.\\nWith no overall outlay of funds or assumption of risk, arbitrage consists of combining \\nseveral transactions that ultimately yield a proﬁt.'),\n",

In practice, arbitrageurs often take on a certain amount of \\nrisk as their behaviour is on the frontier between speculation and arbitrage. For arbitrage \\nto be successful, the underlying securities must be liquid enough for the transactions to \\nbe executed simultaneously.\\nArbitrage is of paramount importance in a market. By destroying opportunities as \\nit uncovers them, arbitrage participates in the development of new markets by creating \\nliquidity. It also eliminates the temporary imperfections that can appear from time to time. \\nAs soon as disequilibrium appears, arbitrageurs buy and sell assets and increase market \\nliquidity. It is through their very actions that the disequilibrium is reduced to zero. Once \\nequilibrium is reached, arbitrageurs stop trading and wait for the next opportunity.\\nThanks to arbitrage, all prices for a given asset are equal at a given point in time. \\nArbitrage ensures ﬂuidity between markets and contributes to their liquidity. It is the \\nbasic behaviour that guarantees market efﬁciency.\\nThroughout this book, you will see that financial miracles are impossible because arbi-\\ntrage levels the playing field between assets exhibiting the same level of risk.\\nYou should also be aware that the three types of behaviour described here do not cor-\\nrespond to three mutually exclusive categories of investors. A market participant who is \\nprimarily a speculator might carry out arbitrage activities or partially hedge his position. \\nA hedger might decide to hedge only part of his position and speculate on the remaining \\nportion, etc.\\nMoreover, these three types of behaviour exist simultaneously in every market. \\nA\\xa0market cannot function only with hedgers, because there will be no one to assume the \\nrisks they don’t want to take. As we saw above, a market composed wholly of speculators \\nis not viable either. Finally, a market consisting only of arbitrageurs would be even more \\ndifficult to imagine.\\nA market is ﬂuid, liquid and displays the “right prices” when its participants include \\nhedgers, speculators and arbitrageurs.\\nThe reader will not be fooled by the colloquial use of some words. “Hedge funds” \\ndo not operate hedging transactions but are most often involved in speculating.

This fundamental concept gives rise to the tech-\\nniques of capitalisation, discounting and net present value, described below.\\nThese are more than just tools, but actual reﬂexes that must be studied and acquired.\\nSection 16.1\\nCAPITALISATION\\nConsider an example of a businessman who invests €100 000 in his business at the end \\nof 2004 and then sells it 10 years later for €1 800 000. In the meantime, he receives no \\nincome from his business, nor does he invest any additional funds into it. Here is a simple \\nproblem: given an initial outlay of €100 000 that becomes €1 800 000 in 10 years, and \\nwithout any outside funds being invested in the business, what is the return on the busi-\\nnessman’s investment?\\nHis profit after 10 years was €1 700 000 (€1 800 000 – €100 000) on an initial out-\\nlay of €100 000. Hence, his return was (1 700 000/100 000) or 1700% over a period of \\n10 years.\\nIs this a good result or not?\\nActually, the return is not quite as impressive as it first looks. To find the annual \\nreturn, our first thought might be to divide the total return (1700%) by number of years \\n(10) and say that the average return is 170% per year.\\nWhile this may look like a reasonable approach, it is in fact far from accurate. The \\nvalue 170% has nothing to do with an annual return, which compares the funds invested \\nand the funds recovered after one year. In the case above, there is no income for 10 years. \\nUsually, calculating interest assumes a flow of revenue each year, which can then be rein-\\nvested, and which in turn begins producing additional interest.'),\n",

This is incorrect \\nreasoning.\\nThere is only one sensible way to calculate the return on the above investment. First, it \\nis necessary to seek the rate of return on a hypothetical investment that would generate \\nincome at the end of each year. After 10 years, the rate of return on the initial investment \\nwill have to have transformed €100 000 into €1 800 000. Further, the income generated \\nmust not be paid out, but rather it has to be reinvested (in which case the income is said \\nto be capitalised).\\nCapitalising income means foregoing receipt of it. It then becomes capital and itself \\nbegins to produce interest during the following periods.\\nTherefore, we are now trying to calculate the annual return on an investment that grows \\nfrom €100 000 into €1 800 000 after 10 years, with all annual income to be reinvested \\neach year.\\nAn initial attempt to solve this problem can be made using a rate of return equal to \\n10%. If, at the end of 2004, €100 000 is invested at that rate, it will produce 10% × €100 \\n000, or €10 000 in interest in 2005.\\nThis €10 000 will then be added to the initial capital outlay and begin, in turn, to pro-\\nduce interest. (Hence the term “to capitalise,” which means to add to capital.) The capital \\nthus becomes €110 000 and produces 10% × €110 000 in interest in 2004, i.e. €10 000 on \\nthe initial outlay plus €1000 on the interest from 10 000 (10% × €10 000).

At 33.5%, annual income of €33 \\n500 for 10 years (plus the initial investment of €100 000 paid back after the tenth \\nyear) is exactly the same as not receiving any income for 10 years and then receiving \\n€1 800 000 in the tenth year.\\n33 5 1 800 000\\n100 000\\n1\\n10\\n.% ,,\\n,=−⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟1\\n1'),\n",

The \\nlower the income he has received on his investment, the more he would expect to receive \\nwhen selling it. Only a high valuation would give him a return that makes economic sense.\\nThe lack of intermediate income must be offset by a high terminal valuation. The \\nsame line of reasoning applies to an industrial investment that does not produce any \\nincome during the first few years. The longer it takes it to produce its first income, the \\ngreater that income must be in order to produce a satisfactory return.\\nWhen no income \\nis paid out, the \\nterminal value \\nrises considerably, \\nquadrupling, for \\nexample, over 10 \\nyears at 15%, but \\nrising 16.4-fold \\nover 20 years at \\nthe same rate, as \\nillustrated in this \\ngraph.'),\n",

Regardless of whether income is paid out or reinvested, it has been \\nshown that the slightest change in the timing of income modifies the rate of return.\\nTo simplify, consider an investment of 100, which must be paid off at the end of year \\n1, with an interest accrued of 10. Suppose, however, that the borrower is negligent and \\nthe lender absent-minded, and the borrower repays the principal and the interest one year \\nlater than he should.

Technically speaking, what is discounting?\\nTo discount is to “depreciate” the future. It is to be more rigorous with future \\ncash flows than present cash flows, because future cash flows cannot be spent or \\ninvested immediately. First, take tomorrow’s cash flow and then apply to it a multiplier \\ncoefficient below 1, which is called a discounting factor. The discounting factor is used \\nto express a future value as a present value, thus reflecting the depreciation brought on \\nby time.\\nConsider an offer whereby someone will give you €1000 in five years. As you will \\nnot receive this sum for another five years, you can apply a discounting factor to it, for \\nexample, 0.6. The present, or today’s, value of this future sum is then 600. Having dis-\\ncounted the future value to a present value, we can then compare it to other values. For '),\n",

After all, “time is money”. Any sum \\nreceived later is worth less than the same sum received today.\\nRemember that investors discount because they demand a certain rate of return .\\nIf a security pays you 110 in one year and you wish to see a return of 10% on your\\ninvestment, the most you would pay today for the security (i.e. its present value) is 100. At \\nthis price (100) and for the amount you know you will receive in one year (110), you will \\nget a return of 10% on your investment of 100. However, if a return of 11% is required on \\nthe investment, then the price you are willing to pay changes. In this case, you would be \\nwilling to pay no more than 99.1 for the security because the gain would have been 10.9 \\n(or 11% of 99.1), which will still give you a final payment of 110.\\nDiscounting is calculated with the required return of the investor. If the investment \\ndoes not meet or exceed the investor’s expectations, he will forego it and seek a better \\nopportunity elsewhere.\\nDiscounting converts a future value into a present value. This is the opposite result \\nof capitalisation.\\nDiscounting converts future values into present values, while capitalisation converts \\npresent values into future ones. Hence, to return to the example above, €1 800 000 in 10 \\nyears discounted at 33.5% is today worth €100 000. €100 000 today will be worth €1 800 \\n000 when capitalised at 33.5%. over 10 years.\\nCapitalisation\\nDiscounting\\nTime\\nx (1+t)n\\n(1+t)n\\n1x\\nVnV0\\nDiscounting and capitalisation Discounting and \\ncapitalisation are \\nthus two ways of \\nexpressing the \\nsame phenomenon: \\nthe time value of \\nmoney.\\n2/ DISCOUNTING AND CAPITALISATION FACTORS\\nTo discount a sum, the same mathematical formulas are used as those for capitalising a \\nsum.

So, without being aware of it, you already knew how to calculate the value of \\na security!\\n1/ FROM  THE  PRESENT  VALUE  OF A SECURITY  . . .\\nThe present value (PV) of a security is the sum of its discounted cash flows; i.e.:\\n \\nPV F\\nr\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nN\\n= +=\\n∑()11\\nwhere Fn are the cash flows generated by the security, r is the applied discounting rate and \\nn is the number of years for which the security is discounted.\\nAll securities also have a market value, particularly on the secondary market.

Therefore you will probably \\nwant to invest in it, i.e. to invest in the upside potential of its value.\\nIf, however, the security’s present value is below its market value, you should sell it \\nat once, for its market value is sure to diminish.\\n2/ . . . TO ITS FAIR VALUE\\nIf an imbalance occurs between a security’s market value and its present value, efficient \\nmarkets will seek to re-establish balance and reduce net present value to zero. Investors \\nacting on efficient markets seek out investments offering positive net present value, in \\norder to realise that value. When they do so, they push net present value towards zero, \\nultimately arriving at the fair value of the security.\\nIn efﬁcient, fairly valued markets, net present values are zero, i.e. market value is equal \\nto present value.\\n3/ APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF NET PRESENT VALUE TO OTHER INVESTMENTS\\nUp to this point, the discussion has been limited to financial securities. However, the con-\\ncepts of present value and net present value can easily be applied to any investment, such \\nas the construction of a new factory, the launch of a new product, the takeover of a com-\\npeting company or any other asset that will generate positive and/or negative cash flows.\\nThe concept of net present value can be interpreted in three different ways:\\n1. the value created by an investment  – for example, if the investment requires an \\noutlay of €100 and the present value of its future cash flow is €110, then the investor \\nhas become €10 wealthier;\\n2. the maximum additional amount that the investor is willing to pay to make the \\ninvestment – if the investor pays up to €10 more, he has not necessarily made a bad \\ndeal, as he is paying up to €110 for an asset that is worth €110;\\n3. the difference between the present value of the investment ( €110) and its market \\nvalue (€100).\\nSection 16.4\\nWHAT DOES NET PRESENT\\nVALUE DEPEND ON ?\\nWhile net present value is obviously based on the amount and timing of cash flows, it is \\nworth examining how it varies with the discounting rate.'),\n",

By \\nusing the interest rate at which the money will be invested, the future amounts can be calcu-\\nlated. Thus, the future value of a sum of money can be determined by way of capitalisation.\\nDiscounting involves calculating today’s value of a future cash ﬂow, what is known as the \\npresent value, on the basis of rates of return required by investors. By calculating the present \\nvalue of a future sum, discounting can be used for comparing future cash ﬂows that will not \\nbe received on the same date.\\nDiscounting and capitalisation are two ways of expressing the same phenomenon: the time \\nvalue of money.\\nCapitalisation is based on compound interest. Vn = V0 × (1 + r)n\\nwhere V0 is the initial value of the investment, r is the rate of return, n is the duration of the \\ninvestment in years, (1+r)n is the capitalisation factor and Vn is the terminal value.\\nDiscounting is the inverse of capitalisation. It is important to note that any precise ﬁnancial \\ncalculation must account for cash ﬂows at the moment when they are received or paid, and \\nnot when they are due.\\nNet present value (NPV) is the difference between present value and the value at which the \\nsecurity or share can be bought. Net present value measures the creation or destruction of \\nvalue that could result from the purchase of a security or making an investment. When mar-\\nkets are in equilibrium, net present values are usually nil.\\nChanges in present value and net present value move in the opposite direction from changes \\nin discount rates. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value and net present \\nvalue, and vice versa.\\nIn many cases, calculating present value and net present value can be made a lot simpler \\nthrough ad hoc formulas.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/ Why should we discount?\\n2/ What is the discount factor equal to?\\n3/ On what should you base a choice between two equal discounted values?\\n4/ What is the simple link between the discount factor and the capitalisation factor?\\n5/ Why are capitalisation factors always greater than 1?\\n6/ Why are discount factors always less than 1?\\n7/ Should you discount even if there is no inflation and no risk?

It is just that one is applied to financial securities \\n(yield to maturity) and the other to capital expenditure (IRR).\\nSection 17.1\\nHOW IS INTERNAL  RATE  OF RETURN  DETERMINED ?\\nTo calculate IRR, make r the unknown and simply use the NPV formula again. The rate \\nr is determined as follows:\\nNPV F\\nr Vn\\nn\\nn\\nN\\n= + −\\n−\\n∑()1\\n0\\n1\\nTo use the same example from the previous chapter:\\n0.8\\n(1 )\\n0.8\\n(1 )\\n0.8\\n(1 ) =225+ + + ++ +rr r …\\nIn other words, an investment’s internal rate of return is the rate at which its market value \\nis equal to the present value of the investment’s future cash flows.\\nIt is possible to use trial-and-error to determine IRR. This will result in an interest \\nrate that gives a negative net present value and another that gives a positive net present \\nvalue. These negative and positive values constitute a range of values which can be nar-\\nrowed until the yield to maturity is found; in this case it is about 28.6%.\\nObviously, this type of calculation is time-consuming. It is much easier to just use \\na calculator or spreadsheet program with a function to determine the yield to maturity.'),\n",

The investor can then compare \\nthis expected return to his required return rate, thereby simplifying the investment decision.\\nThe decision-making rule is very simple: if an investment’s internal rate of return is \\nhigher than the investor’s required return, he will make the investment or buy the security. \\nOtherwise, he will abandon the investment or sell the security.\\nIn our example, since the internal rate of return (28.6%) is higher than the return demanded \\nby the investor (20%), he should make the investment. If the market value of the same invest-\\nment were 3 (and not 2), the internal rate of return would be 10.4%, and he should not invest.\\nAn investment is worth making when its internal rate of return is equal to or greater than \\nthe investor’s required return. An investment is not worth making when its internal rate \\nof return is below the investor’s required return.\\nHence, at fair value, the internal rate of return is identical to the market return. In other \\nwords, net present value is nil.\\nSection 17.3\\nTHE LIMITS OF THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN\\nWith this new investment-decision-making criterion, it is now necessary to consider how \\nIRR can be used vis-à-vis net present value. It is also important to investigate whether or \\nnot these two criteria could somehow produce contradictory conclusions.\\nIf it is a simple matter of whether or not to buy into a given investment, or whether or not \\nto invest in a project, the two criteria produce exactly the same result, as shown in the example.\\nIf the cash flow schedule is the same, then calculating the NPV by choosing the \\ndiscounting rate and calculating the internal rate of return (and comparing it with the \\ndiscounting rate) are two sides of the same mathematical coin.\\nThe issue is, however, a bit more complex when it comes to choosing between several \\nsecurities or projects, which is usually the case. Comparing several streams of cash flows \\n(securities) should make it possible to choose between them.\\n1/ THE REINVESTMENT RATE AND THE MODIFIED IRR (MIRR)\\nConsider two investments A and B, with the following cash flows:\\nY e a r 1234567\\nInvestment A 6 0.5\\nInvestment B 2300 2 . 1 0 5 . 1'),\n",

If investment A’s market value is 5, its net present value is 1.17. If investment B’s \\nmarket value is 7.5, its net present value is 2.40.\\nNow calculate the IRR. It is 27.8% for investment A and 12.7% for investment B. Or, \\nto sum up:\\nNPV at 5% IRR%\\nInvestment A 1.17 27.8\\nInvestment B 2.40 12.7\\nInvestment A delivers a rate of return that is much higher than the required return \\n(27.8% vs. 5%) during a short period of time. Investment B’s rate of return is much \\nlower (12.7% vs. 27.8%), but is still higher than the 5% required return demanded and \\nis delivered over a far longer period (seven years vs. two). Our NPV and internal rate \\nof return models are telling us two different things. So should we buy investment A or \\ninvestment B?\\nAt first glance, investment B would appear to be the more attractive of the two. Its \\nNPV is higher and it creates the most value: 2.40 vs. 1.17.\\nHowever, some might say that investment A is more attractive, as cash flows are \\nreceived earlier than with investment B and therefore can be reinvested sooner in high-\\nreturn projects. While that is theoretically possible, it is the strong (and optimistic) form \\nof the theory because competition among investors and the mechanisms of arbitrage tend \\nto move net present values towards zero. Net present values moving towards zero means \\nthat exceptional rates of return converge toward the required rate of return, thereby elimi-\\nnating the possibility of long-lasting high-return projects.\\nGiven the convergence of the exceptional rates toward required rates of return, it \\nis more reasonable to suppose that cash flows from investment A will be reinvested \\nat the required rate of return of 5%. The exceptional rate of 27.8% is unlikely to be \\nrecurrent. \\nAnd this is exactly what happens if we adopt the NPV decision rule. The NPV in fact \\nassumes that the reinvestment of interim cash flows is made at the required rate of return.  \\nIf we apply the same equation to the IRR, we observe that the reinvestment rate is simply \\nthe IRR again. However, in equilibrium, it is unreasonable to think that the company can \\ncontinue to invest at the same rate of the (sometimes) exceptional IRR of a specific proj-\\nect. Instead it is much more reasonable to assume that, at best, the company can invest at \\nthe required rate of return.\\nHowever, a solution to the reinvestment rate problem of IRR is the Modified IRR \\n(MIRR).\\nMIRR is the rate of return that yields an NPV of zero when the initial outlay is compared \\nwith the terminal value of the project’s net cash ﬂows reinvested at the required rate \\nof return.\\nDetermining the MIRR requires two stages:'),\n",

Calculate forward until the end of the project to determine the terminal value of \\nthe project by compounding all intermediate cash flows at the required rate \\nof return.\\n2. Find the internal rate of return that equates the terminal value with the initial outlay.\\nSo, by capitalising cash flow from investments A and B at the required rate of return (5%) \\nup to period 7, we obtain from investment A in period 7: 6 × 1.0056 + 0.5 × 1.055, or 8.68. \\nFrom investment B we obtain 2 × 1.056 + 3 × 1.055 + 2.1 × 1.052 + 5.1, or 13.9. The inter-\\nnal rate of return is 8.20% for investment A and 9.24% for investment B.\\nWe have thus reconciled the NPV and internal rate of return models.\\nSome might say that it is not consistent to expect investment A to create more value \\nthan investment B, as only 5 has been invested in A vs. 7.5 for B. Even if we could buy an \\nadditional “half-share” of A, in order to equalise the purchase price, the NPV of our new \\ninvestment in A would only be 1.17 × 1.5 = 1.76, which would still be less than investment \\nB’s NPV of 2.40. For the reasons discussed above, we are unlikely to find another invest-\\nment with a return identical to that of investment A.\\nInstead, we should assume that the 2.5 in additional investment would produce the \\nrequired rate of return (5%) for seven years. In this case, NPV would remain, by defini-\\ntion, at 1.17, whereas the internal rate of return of this investment would fall to 11%. NPV \\nand the internal rate of return would once again lead us to conclude that investment B is \\nthe more attractive investment.\\n2/ MULTIPLE OR NO IRR\\nConsider the following investments:\\nYear   0   1 2\\nProject A   4 −74\\nProject B −1      7.2 −7.2\\n–1 .5\\n–1 .0\\n–0.5\\n0\\n0.5\\n1. 0\\n1. 5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n100% 200% 300% 400% 500% 600% 700%\\nNPV in €\\nDiscount rate\\nProject A\\nProject B\\n0%\\nThere are two \\nannual rates of \\nreturn!

Thus, we have no benchmark for deciding if it is a good invest-\\nment or not. Although the NPV remains positive for all the discount rates, it remains only \\nslightly positive and the company may decide not to do it.\\nProject B has two IRRs, and we do not know which is the right one. There is no good \\nreason to use one over the other. Investments with “unconventional” cash flow sequences \\nare rare, but they can happen. Consider a firm that is cutting timber in a forest. The timber \\nis cut, sold and the firm gets an immediate profit. But, when harvesting is complete, the \\nfirm may be forced to replant the forest at considerable expense.\\nIn conclusion, it is not because an investment project has a higher IRR than another \\nthat it should be preferred.\\nThe IRR criteria does not allow for the ranking of different investment opportunities. \\nIt only allows us to determine whether one project yields at least the return required by \\ninvestors. When the IRR does not allow us to judge whether an investment project should \\nbe undertaken or not (e.g. no IRR or several IRRs), then the NPV should be analysed.\\nSection 17.4\\nSOME MORE FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS :\\nINTEREST RATE AND YIELD TO MATURITY\\n1/ NOMINAL RATE OF RETURN AND YIELD TO MATURITY\\nHaving considered the yield to maturity, it is now important to examine interest rates; for \\nexample, on a loan that you wish to take out. Where does the interest rate fit in this discussion?\\nConsider someone who wants to lend you €1000 today at 10% for five years. This \\n10% means 10 per cent per year and constitutes the nominal rate of return of your loan. \\nThis rate will be the basis for calculating interest, proportional to the time elapsed and the \\namount borrowed. Assume that you will pay interest annually.\\nThe first problem is how and when will you pay off the loan?\\nRepayment terms constitute the method of amortisation of the loan. Take the \\nfollowing example:\\n(a)Bullet repayment\\nThe entire loan is paid back at maturity.\\nThe cash flow table would look like this:\\nPeriod Principal still due Interest Amortisation of principal Annuity\\n1 1000 100 0 100\\n2 1000 100 0 100\\n3 1000 100 0 100\\n4 1000 100 0 100\\n5 1000 100 1000 1100\\nTotal debt service is the annual sum of interest and principal to be paid back.

Its effective rate is not 10%, since interest is not being paid on the benchmark \\nannual terms.\\nTo avoid comparing apples and oranges, a financial officer must take into account the \\neffective date of disbursement. We know that one euro today is not the same as one euro \\ntomorrow. Obviously, the financial officer wants to postpone expenditure and accelerate \\nreceipts, thereby having the money work for him. So, naturally the repayment schedule \\nmatters when calculating the rate.\\nWhich is the best approach to take? If the interest rate is 10%, with interest payable \\nevery six months, then the interest rate is 5% for six months. We then have to calculate \\nan effective annual rate (and not for six months), which is our point of reference and our \\nconstant concern.\\nTwo rates referring to two different maturities are said to be equivalent if \\nthe future value of the same amount at the same date is the same with the two \\nrates.\\nIn our example, the lender receives €5 on 1 July which, compounded over six months, \\nbecomes 5 + (10% × 5) / 2 = €5.25 on the following 1 January, the date on which he \\nreceives the second €5 interest payment. So over one year, he will have received €10.25 \\nin interest on a €100 investment.\\nTherefore, the effective annual rate is 10.25%. This is the real cost of the loan, \\nsince the return for the lender is equal to the cost for the borrower.\\n(1 ) (1 / )++tr n a\\nn=\\nFormula for converting nominal rate into effective annual rate.\\nIf the nominal rate (ra) is to be paid n times per year, then the effective annual rate (t) \\nis obtained by compounding this nominal rate n times:\\nwhere n is the number of interest payments in the year and ra/n the proportional rate dur-\\ning one period, or t = (1 + ra / n)n −1.\\nIn our example:\\nt ==(1 10% / 2) 1 10.25%.2+−\\nThe effective interest rate is thus 10.25%, while the nominal rate is 10%.\\nIt should be common sense that an investment at 10% paying interest every six \\nmonths produces a higher return at year end than an investment paying interest annu-\\nally. In the first case, interest is compounded after six months and thus produces interest \\non interest for the next six months. Obviously a loan on which interest is due every six \\nmonths will cost more than one on which interest is charged annually.\\nIt is essential to ﬁrst calculate the effective annual rate before comparing investments \\n(or loans) with different cash ﬂow streams.

The financial officer will \\nuse the annual equivalent rate as his reference rate for this investment.\\n(b) The concept of proportional rate\\nIn our example of a loan at 10%, we would say that the 5% rate over six months is pro-\\nportional to the 10% rate over one year. More generally, two rates are proportional if they \\nare in the same proportion to each other as the periods to which they apply.\\n10% per year is proportional to 5% per half-year or 2.5% per quarter, but 5% half-\\nyearly is not equivalent to 10% annually. Effective annual rate and proportional rates \\nare therefore two completely different concepts that should not be confused.\\nProportional rates are of interest only when calculating the interest actually paid. In \\nno way can they be evaluated with other proportional rates, as they are not comparable.\\nProportional rates serve only to simplify calculations, but they hide the true cost of a \\nloan. Only the effective annual rate (10.25%/year) gives the true cost, unlike the propor-\\ntional rate (10%/year).\\nWhen the time span between two interest payment dates is less than one year, the \\nproportional rate is lower than the effective annual rate (10% is less than 10.25%). When \\nmaturity is more than a year, the proportional rate overestimates the effective annual rate. \\nThis is rare, whereas the first case is quite frequent on money markets where money is lent \\nor borrowed for short period of time.\\nTo avoid error, use the effective annual rate.\\nAs we will see, the bond markets can be misleading since they reason in terms of nominal \\nrate of return: paper is sold above or below par value, the number of days used in cal-\\nculating interest can vary, there could be original issue discounts, and so on. And, most \\nimportantly, on the secondary market, a bond’s present value depends on fluctuations in \\nmarket interest rates.\\nIn the rest of this book, unless otherwise specified, an interest rate or rate of \\nreturn is assumed to be an effective annual rate.'),\n",

The difference between present value and the \\nmarket value of an investment is net present value.\\nIn a market in equilibrium, the net present value of a ﬁnancial investment is nil because it \\nis equal to its present value.\\nAs the value of an investment and the discount rate are fundamentally linked, we also looked \\nat the concept of yield to maturity (which cancels out NPV). Making an investment is only \\nworth it when the yield to maturity is equal to or greater than the investor’s required return. \\nAt fair value, internal rate of return is identical to the required return rate. In other words, \\nnet present value is nil.\\nThe internal rate of return should be handled with care, as it is based on the implicit assump-\\ntion that cash ﬂows will be reinvested at the same rate. It should only be relied on for an \\ninvestment decision concerning a single asset and not for choosing from among several \\nassets, whether they are ﬁnancial (e.g. an investment) or industrial (e.g. a mine, a machine). \\nNPV should be used for such decisions.\\nFinally, some ﬁnancial mathematics helped us look at the link between the nominal interest \\nrate and the yield to maturity of an operation. The nominal (annual) rate of a loan is the rate \\nused to calculate interest in proportion to the period of the loan and the capital borrowed. \\nHowever, one must use the yield to maturity, which may differ from the apparent nominal \\nrate, when interest is not paid on an annual basis.\\nTwo rates referring to two different time periods are equivalent if the future value of the \\nsame sum is the same at a same date. Finally, two rates are proportional if they are in the \\nsame proportion as the maturity to which they refer to. Proportional rates are just a means \\nto compute the interest that is actually to be paid. They have no other use.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/ Why can’t the internal rate of return be used for choosing between two investments?\\n2/ Does the interest rate depend on the terms of repayment of a loan or an investment?\\n3/ Does the interest rate depend on when cash flows occur?\\n4/ What are proportional rates?\\n5/ What is the internal rate of return?\\n6/ What are proportional rates used for?

This chapter will try to explain and measure this risk, and also examine its \\nrepercussions.\\nSection 18.1\\nSOURCES OF RISK\\nThere are various risks involved in financial securities, including:\\ntIndustrial, commercial and labour risks, etc.\\nThere are so many types of risk in this category that we cannot list them all here. \\nThey include lack of competitiveness, emergence of new competitors, technological \\nbreakthroughs, an inadequate sales network, strikes and so on. These risks tend to lower \\ncash flow expectations and thus have an immediate impact on the value of the stock.\\nt Liquidity risk\\nThis is the risk of not being able to sell a security at its fair value as a result of \\neither a liquidity discount or the complete absence of a market or buyers.\\nt Solvency risk\\nThis is the risk that a creditor will lose his entire investment if a debtor cannot \\nrepay him in full, even if the debtor’s assets are liquidated. Traders call this coun-\\nterparty risk.\\nt Foreign exchange (Fx) risk\\nFluctuations in exchange rates can lead to a loss of value of assets denominated \\nin foreign currencies. Similarly, higher exchange rates can increase the value of debt \\ndenominated in foreign currencies when translated into the company’s reporting cur-\\nrency base.\\nt Interest rate risk\\nThe holder of financial securities is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctua-\\ntions.

A flagrant historical \\nexample is the hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920s.\\nt The risk of a fraud\\nThis is the risk that some parties (internal or external) will lie or cheat. The most \\ncommon example is insider trading.\\nt Natural disaster risks\\nThese include storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, cyclones, tidal waves, \\netc. which destroy assets.\\nt Economic risk\\nThis type of risk is characterised by bull or bear markets, anticipation of an \\nacceleration or a slowdown in business activity or changes in labour productivity.\\nThe list is nearly endless; however, at this point it is important to highlight \\ntwo points:\\ntmost financial analysis mentioned and developed in this book tends to generalise the \\nconcept of risk rather than analysing it in depth. So, given the extent to which markets \\nare efficient and evaluate risk correctly, it is not necessary to redo what others have \\nalready done; and \\nt risk is always present. The so-called risk-free rate, to be discussed later, is simply a \\nmanner of speaking. Risk is always present, and to say that risk can be eliminated \\nis either to be excessively confident or to be unable to think about the future – \\nboth very serious faults for an investor.\\nObviously, any serious investment study should begin with a precise analysis of the \\nrisks involved.\\nThe knowledge gleaned from analysts with extensive experience in the business, \\nmixed with common sense, allows us to classify risks into two categories:\\nteconomic risks (political, natural, inflation, fraud and other risks), which threaten \\ncash flows from investments and which come from the “real economy”; and\\nt financial risks (liquidity, currency, interest rate and other risks), which do not directly \\naffect cash flow, but nonetheless do come into the financial sphere.

Obviously, if a risk materialises that seriously hurts company cash \\nflows, investors will seek to sell their securities. Consequently the value of the security falls.\\nMoreover, if a company is exposed to significant risk, some investors will be reluctant \\nto buy its securities. Even before risk materialises, investors’ perceptions that a company’s \\nfuture cash flows are uncertain or volatile will serve to reduce the value of its securities.\\nMost modern finance is based on the premise that investors seek to reduce the uncer-\\ntainty of their future cash flows. By its very nature, risk increases the uncertainty of an \\nasset’s future cash flow, and it therefore follows that such uncertainty will be priced into \\nthe market value of a security.\\nInvestors consider risk only to the extent that it affects the value of the security. Risks \\ncan affect value by changing anticipations of cash flows or the rate at which these cash \\nflows are discounted.\\nTo begin with, it is important to realise that in corporate finance no fundamental \\ndistinction is made between the risk of asset revaluation and the risk of asset devaluation. \\nThat is to say, whether investors expect the value of an asset to rise or decrease is immate-\\nrial. It is the fact that risk exists in the first place that is of significance and affects how \\ninvestors behave.\\nAll risks, regardless of their nature, lead to ﬂuctuations in the value of a ﬁnancial security.\\nConsider, for example, a security with the following cash flows expected for  \\nyears 1 to 4:\\nY e a r 1234\\nCash ﬂow (in €) 100 120 150 190\\nImagine the value of this security is estimated to be €2000 in five years. Assuming a 9% \\ndiscounting rate, its value today would be:\\n  100\\n1.09\\n120\\n1.09\\n150\\n1.09\\n190\\n1.09\\n2000\\n1.092345++++=\\n \\n€1743\\nIf a sudden sharp rise in interest rates raises the discounting rate to 13%, the value of the \\nsecurity becomes:\\n 100\\n1.13\\n120\\n1.13\\n150\\n1.13\\n190\\n1.13\\n2000\\n1.132345++++=  €1488\\nThe security’s value has fallen by 15% whereas cash flows have not changed. \\nHowever, if the company comes out with a new product that raises projected cash flow \\nby 20%, with no further change in the discounting rate, the security’s value then becomes:\\n100 1.20\\n1.13\\n120 1.20\\n1.13\\n150 1.20\\n1.13\\n190 1.20\\n1.13\\n200\\n234\\n× + × + × + × + 00 1.20\\n1.135\\n× = €1786'),\n",

If there is no change in expected cash flows, the stock’s \\nvalue would be:\\n 120\\n1.10\\n144\\n1.10\\n180\\n1.10\\n228\\n1.10\\n2400\\n1.102345++++=  €2009\\nAgain, there has been no change in the stock’s intrinsic characteristics and yet its value \\nhas risen by 12%.\\nIf there is stiff price competition, then previous cash flow projections will have to \\nbe adjusted downward by 10%. If all cash flows fall by the same percentage and the dis-\\ncounting rate remains constant, the value of the company becomes:\\n 2009 (1 10%)×− =  €1808\\nOnce again, the security’s value decreases for reasons specific to the company, not \\nbecause of a fall in the market.\\nIn the previous example, a European investor would have lost 10% of his investment \\n(from €2009 to €1808). If, in the interim, the euro had risen from $1.30 to $1.55, a US \\ninvestor would have gained 7% (from $2612 to $2802).\\nA closer analysis shows that some securities are more volatile than others, i.e. their \\nprice fluctuates more widely. We say that these stocks are “riskier”. The riskier a stock \\nis, the more volatile its price, and vice versa. Conversely, the less risky a security is, the \\nless volatile its price, and vice versa.\\nIn a market economy, a security’s risk is measured in terms of the volatility of its \\nprice (or of its rate of return). The greater the volatility, the greater the risk, and \\nvice versa.\\nV olatility can be measured mathematically by variance and standard deviation.\\nTypically, it is safe to assume that risk dissipates over the long term. The erratic fluc-\\ntuations in the short term give way to the clear outperformance of equities over bonds, \\nand bonds over money-market investments. The chart below tends to back up this point of \\nview. It presents data on the path of wealth (POW) for the three asset classes. The POW \\nmeasures the growth of €1 invested in any given asset, assuming that all proceeds are \\nreinvested in the same asset.\\nAs is easily seen from the following chart, risk does dissipate, but only over the long \\nterm. In other words, an investor must be able to invest his funds and then do without them \\nduring this long-term timeframe. It sometimes requires strong nerves not to give in to the \\ntemptation to sell when prices collapse, as happened with stock markets in 1929, 1974, \\nSeptember 2001 and October–November 2008.\\nSince 1900, UK stocks have delivered an average annual return after inflation of \\n5.3%. Yet, during 38 of those years the returns were negative, in particular in 1974, when \\ninvestors lost 57% on a representative portfolio of UK stocks.'),\n",

Over the stretch of one century, these may be excep-\\ntional events, but they have enormous repercussions when they do occur.\\nThe degree of risk depends on the investment timeframe and tends to diminish over the \\nlong term. Yet rarely do investors have the means and stamina to think only of the long \\nterm and ignore short- to medium-term needs. Investors are only human, and there is \\ndeﬁnitely risk in the short and medium terms!\\nSection 18.3\\nTOOLS  FOR  MEASURING  RETURN  AND  RISK\\n1/ EXPECTED  RETURN\\nTo begin, it must be realised that a security’s rate of return and the value of a financial \\nsecurity are actually two sides of the same coin. The rate of return will be considered first.\\nThe holding-period return is calculated from the sum total of cash flows for a given \\ninvestment, i.e. income, in the form of interest or dividends earned on the funds invested \\nand the resulting capital gain or loss when the security is sold.\\nIf just one period is examined, the return on a financial security can be expressed as \\nfollows:\\nFV V V V10 1 0 0/( ) /+− = + Income Capital gai n or loss\\nHere F1 is the income received by the investor during the period, V0 is the value of the \\nsecurity at the beginning of the period and V1 is the value of the security at the end of the \\nperiod.\\nIn an uncertain world, investors cannot calculate their returns in advance, as the value \\nof the security is unknown at the end of the period. In some cases, the same is true for the \\nincome to be received during the period.\\nTherefore, investors use the concept of expected return, which is the average of \\npossible returns weighted by their likelihood of occurring. Familiarity with the science of \\nstatistics should aid in understanding the notion of expected outcome.\\nGiven security A with 12 chances out of 100 of showing a return of −22%, 74 chances \\nout of 100 of showing a return of 6% and 14 chances out of 100 of showing a return of \\n16%, its expected return would then be:\\n−×+ ×+×22 12\\n100 6 74\\n100 16 14\\n100 4%% % , % or about\\nMore generally, expected return or expected outcome is equal to:\\nExpected return formula Er r p r\\nt\\nn\\ntt() =× =\\n=\\n∑\\n1\\nwhere rt is a possible return and pt the probability of it occurring.'),\n",

Standard deviation is expressed as the square root of the variance:\\nσ() ()rV r=\\nThe variance of investment A above is therefore:\\n12\\n100 22 4 74\\n100 64 14\\n100 16 4\\n22 2\\n×− −() +×− () +× − ()%% %% %%\\nwhere V(r) = 1%, which corresponds to a standard deviation of 10%.\\nIn sum, to formalise the concepts of risk and return:\\n t expected outcome E(r), is a measure of expected return; and\\n t standard deviation σ(r) measures the average dispersion of returns around expected \\noutcome; in other words, risk.\\nSection 18.4\\nMARKET  AND  SPECIFIC  RISK\\nRisk in finance is materialised by fluctuation of value which is equivalent to fluctuation of \\nreturns. Hence, one figure summarises all of the different risks, the knowledge of which \\ndoes not really matter. Only the impact on value is important.\\nFluctuations in the value of a security can be due to:\\n t fluctuations in the entire market. The market could rise as a whole after an unex-\\npected cut in interest rates, stronger-than-expected economic growth figures, etc. All \\nstocks will then rise, although some will move more than others. The same thing can \\noccur when the entire market moves downward; or\\n2/ VARIANCE , A RISK -ANALYSIS  TOOL\\nIntuitively, the greater the risk on an investment, the wider the variations in its return, \\nand the more uncertain that return is. While the holder of a government bond is sure to \\nreceive his coupons (unless the government goes bankrupt!), this is far from true for the \\nshareholder of an offshore oil drilling company. He could lose everything, show a decent \\nreturn or hit the jackpot.\\nTherefore, the risk carried by a security can be looked at in terms of the dispersion of \\nits possible returns around an average return. Consequently, risk can be measured math-\\nematically by the variance of its return, i.e. by the sum of the squares of the deviation of \\neach return from expected outcome, weighted by the likelihood of each of the possible \\nreturns occurring, or:\\nRisk formula V rp r r\\nt\\nn\\ntt() ( )=× −\\n=\\n∑\\n1\\n2'),\n",

To varying degrees, market risk affects all securities. For \\nexample, if a nation switches to a 35-hour working week with no cut in wages, all \\ncompanies will be affected. However, in such a case, it stands to reason that textile \\nmakers will be affected more than cement companies.\\n t Specific, intrinsic or idiosyncratic risk is independent of market-wide phenomena \\nand is due to factors affecting just the one company, such as mismanagement, a fac-\\ntory fire, an invention that renders a company’s main product line obsolete, etc. (In \\nthe next chapter, it will be shown how this risk can be eliminated by diversification.)\\nMarket volatility can be economic or financial in origin, but it can also result from antici-\\npation of flows (dividends, capital gains, etc.) or a variation in the cost of equity. For exam-\\nple, an overheating of the economy could raise the cost of equity (i.e. after an increase in \\nthe central bank rate) and reduce anticipated cash flows due to weaker demand. Together, \\nthese two factors could exert a double downward pressure on financial securities.\\nSince market risk and specific risk are independent, they can be measured indepen-\\ndently and we can apply Pythagoras’s theorem (in more mathematical terms, the two risk \\nvectors are orthogonal) to the overall risk of a single security:\\n(Overall risk)2 = (Market risk)2  + (Speciﬁc risk)2\\nThe systematic risk presented by a financial security is frequently expressed in terms \\nof its sensitivity to market fluctuations. This is done via a linear regression between peri-\\nodic market returns (rMt ) and the periodic returns of each security J: (rJt ). This yields the \\nregression line expressed in the following equation:\\nr rJt JJ t Jt= αβ ε+× + M\\nβJ is a parameter specific to each investment J and it expresses the relationship between \\nfluctuations in the value of J and the market. It is thus a coefficient of volatility or of sen-\\nsitivity. We call it the beta or the beta coefficient.\\nA security’s total risk is reflected in the standard deviation of its return, σ(rJ).\\nA security’s market risk is therefore equal to βJ × σ(rM), where σ(rM) is the standard \\ndeviation of the market return. Therefore it is also proportional to the beta, i.e. the secu-\\nrity’s market-linked volatility. The higher the beta, the greater the market risk borne by \\nthe security. If β >1, the security’s returns move at a ratio of greater than 1:1 with respect \\nto the market. Conversely, securities whose beta is below 1 are less affected by market \\nfluctuations.\\nThe specific risk  of security J is equal to the standard deviation of the different \\nresiduals ∈Jt of the regression line, expressed as σ(εJ), i.e. the variations in the stock that \\nare not tied to market variations.'),\n",

Another example is automakers, \\nwhich tend to have a β close to 1. There is an old saying in North America, “As General \\nMotors goes, so goes the economy”. This serves to highlight how GM’s financial health \\nis to some extent a reflection of the health of the entire economy. Thus, beta analysis can \\nshow how GM will be directly affected by macroeconomic shifts.\\n(b) Cost structure\\nThe greater the proportion of fixed costs to total costs, the higher the breakeven point, and \\nthe more volatile the cash flows. Companies that have a high ratio of fixed costs (such \\nas cement makers) have a high β, while those with a low ratio of fixed costs (like mass-\\nmarket service retailers) have a low β.\\n(c) Financial structure\\nThe greater a company’s debt, the greater its financing costs. Financing costs are fixed \\ncosts which increase a company’s breakeven point and, hence, its earnings volatility. The \\nheavier a company’s debt or the more heavily leveraged the company is, the higher theβ\\nis of its shares.\\n(d)Visibility on company performance\\nThe quality of management and the clarity and quantity of information the market has \\nabout a company will all have a direct influence on its beta. All other factors being equal, \\nif a company gives out little or low quality information, the β of its stock will be higher as \\nthe market will factor the lack of visibility into the share price.\\n(e) Earnings growth\\nThe higher the forecast rate of earnings growth, the higher the β. Most of a company’s value \\nin cash flows is far down the road and thus highly sensitive to any change in assumptions.\\nSection 18.6\\nPORTFOLIO RISK\\n1/ THE FORMULA APPROACH\\nConsider the following two stocks, Heineken and Ericsson, which have the following \\ncharacteristics:\\nHeineken % Ericsson %\\nExpected return: E(r)6 1 3\\nRisk: σ(r)1 0 1 7'),\n",

However, the problem can be looked at in another way: would buying a com-\\nbination of Ericsson and Heineken shares be preferable to buying just one or the \\nother?\\nIt is likely that the investor will seek to diversify and create a portfolio made up of \\nEricsson shares (in a proportion of XE) and Heineken shares (in a proportion of XH).

The standard deviation of their return is thus zero. Traditionally, this is illustrated \\nwith government bonds, even if assuming that the government cannot go bankrupt is \\nbecoming harder and harder. This has now led us to view the 1-month Treasury bill as \\nrisk-free (e.g. the German bill for the eurozone, the US Treasury bill for the US). \\nIf a portfolio has a risk-free asset F in proportion (1 − XH) and the portfolio consists \\nexclusively of Heineken shares, then the portfolio’s expected return E(rH,F) will be equal to:\\nE rX r X E r r E r r X() ( ) ( ) ( ( ) )H,F H F H H F H F H=− × + × = + − ×1\\nThe portfolio’s expected return is equal to the return of the risk-free asset, plus a risk  \\npremium, multiplied by the proportion of Heineken shares in the portfolio. The risk pre-\\nmium is the difference between the expected return on Heineken and the return on the \\nrisk-free asset.\\nHow much risk does the portfolio carry? Its risk will simply be the risk of the \\nHeineken stock, commensurate with its proportion in the portfolio, expressed as  \\nfollows:\\nσ σrXrH,F H H() =× ()\\nIf the investor wants to increase his expected return, he will increase XH. He could even \\nborrow money at the risk-free rate and use the funds to buy Heineken stock, but the risk \\ncarried by his portfolio would rise commensurately.\\nBy combining the previous two equations, we can eliminate XH, thus deriving the \\n following equation:\\nEr r r Er r() ()\\n() [( ) ]H,F F\\nH,F\\nHF\\nr=+ ×−σ\\nσ\\nThis portfolio’s expected return is equal to the risk-free rate, plus the difference between \\nthe expected return on Heineken and the risk-free rate. This difference is weighted by \\nthe ratio of the portfolio’s standard deviation to Heineken’s standard deviation.\\nContinuing with the Heineken example, and assuming that rF is 3%, with 50% of the \\nportfolio consisting of a risk-free asset, the following is obtained:\\nE r\\nr\\n() % ( % % ). . %\\n() . % %\\nH,F\\nH,F\\n=+ − ×=\\n=×=\\n36 3 0 5 4 5\\n05 0 1 0 5σ\\nHence:\\nE r( ) % ( % / %) ( % %) . %H,F =+ ×− =35 1 06 34 5\\nFor a portfolio that includes a risk-free asset, there is a linear relationship between expected \\nreturn and risk.

This new portfolio will be on a line that connects \\nthe risk-free rate to the portfolio Alpha that has been chosen. But as we can observe on \\nthe following chart, this portfolio is not the best portfolio.  Portfolio P provides a better \\nreturn for the same risk. Portfolio P is situated on the line tangential to the efficient fron-\\ntier. There is no other portfolio than P that offers a better return for the same amount of \\nrisk-taking.

The tangent point at M constitutes the optimal combination for all investors. \\nIf we introduce the assumption that all investors have homogeneous expectations, i.e. \\nthat they have the same opinions on expected returns and risk of financial assets, then the \\nefficient frontier of risky assets will be the same for all of them.

Managers are employees of banks, insurance companies or independent.\\n12,750 13,050\\n10,700 11,120\\n11,870\\n15,060\\n16,570\\n17 ,760\\n14,320\\n16,940\\n19,940 19,970\\n22,170\\n23,790\\n–\\n2,000\\n4,000\\n6,000\\n8,000\\n10,000\\n12,000\\n14,000\\n16,000\\n18,000\\n20,000\\n22,000\\n24,000\\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\\nWorldwide investment fund assets (in €bn)\\nSource: Efama\\nHowever, as our reader knows, not all investors subscribe to this theory. Some take other \\napproaches, described below. Sometimes investors combine different approaches.\\nThe strategy that is closest to financial theory is index tracking. It consists of trying to \\nfollow the performance of a market index. Index trackers are ideal tools for the investor \\nwho believes strongly in market efficiency. The development of this strategy has run in \\nparallel to the diffusion of portfolio theory. Index trackers can be listed on a market and \\nare then called Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs. Most stock markets now have a specific \\nmarket segment for the listing of trackers. Over 4700 trackers are listed for a total amount \\nof over $1800bn.\\nIn terms of portfolio management we shall consider the difference between a top-\\ndown and a bottom-up approach. In a top-down approach, investors focus on the asset \\nclass (shares, bonds, money-market funds) and the international markets in which they \\nwish to invest (i.e. the individual securities chosen are of little importance). In a bottom-\\nup approach (commonly known as stock-picking), investors choose stocks on the basis of \\ntheir specific characteristics, not the sector in which they belong. The goal of the bottom-\\nup approach is to find that rare pearl, i.e. the stock that is undervalued by the market.'),\n",

They believe that, sooner or later, market value will approach \\nintrinsic value. These investors believe that all other price changes are temporary \\nphenomena. Intrinsic value is what financial analysts seek to measure. A fundamental \\ninvestor seeks to invest over the medium or long term and, like Warren Buffet, who is \\nthe most famous of them all, wait patiently for the market value to converge towards \\nthe intrinsic value, i.e. for the market to agree with them.\\nWe can then split these investors between those who are looking for growth stocks, i.e. \\ncompanies who are operating in a fast-growing industry, and those who prefer value \\nstocks, i.e. firms operating in more mature sectors but which offer long-term performance. \\nAt the opposite end you will find yield stocks whose return comes almost exclusively \\nfrom the dividend paid, and their market price is then very stable. Asset managers have \\ndeveloped specific funds for each type of investor: growth funds, value funds, but also \\nmixed funds, which blend the two types of stocks.\\ntInvestors who focus on technical analysis, the so-called chartists, who do not \\nseek to determine the value of a stock. Instead, these investors conduct detailed \\nstudies of trends in a stock’s market value and transaction volumes in the hope of \\nspotting short-term trends. \\nChartists prefer to analyse how the market perceives intrinsic value rather than looking \\nat the stock’s actual intrinsic value. Chartists believe the market is predictable in the very \\nshort term, and this is often the attitude of traders and banks who take positions for very \\nshort periods, from a few hours to a few days.\\nTechnical analysis is not based directly on any theory. It is based more on psychology \\nthan mathematics. Chartists believe that while investors are not perfectly rational, they are \\nat least fixed in their way of reasoning, with predictable reactions to certain situations. \\nChartists look for these patterns of behaviour in price trends.\\nOne method consists in calculating a moving average of prices over a certain number \\nof days (generally 20). Chartists look for a price to break through its moving average, \\neither upward or downward.\\nAnother method is based on comparing a stock’s prices with its highs and lows over \\na given period. This is used in identifying support and resistance levels:\\nta support is a level that the price has very little chance of falling below; and\\nt a resistance is a level that the price has very little chance of rising above.\\nThe fundamental investor believes that markets are predictable in the medium or long \\nterm, but certainly not in the short term. Chartists believe they are predictable in the \\nshort term, but not in the medium or long term. Believers in efﬁcient markets think that \\nmarkets are never predictable!\\nAnother type of fund management has arisen since the mid-1990s, so-called alterna-\\ntive management, which offers large flexibility on the products traded (stocks, bonds, \\nFx), and is based on market declines, volatility, liquidity, time value and abnormal valu-\\nations, rather than on rising prices. An example of alternative management is the hedge\\nfund, which is a speculative fund seeking high returns and relying heavily on derivatives, '),\n",

Hedge funds use leverage and commit capital in excess of their \\nequity. Hedge funds offer additional diversification to “conventional” portfolios, as their \\nresults are in theory not linked to the performances of equity and bond markets. Short-\\nseller funds, for example, bet that a stock will fall by borrowing shares at interest and sell-\\ning them, then buying them back after their price falls and returning them to the borrower.\\nInstitutional investors are taking a growing interest in hedge funds. As of the end of \\n2013, hedge funds had about $2400bn under management.\\nIn recent years, hedge funds’ risk-adjusted performance has been above that of tradi-\\ntional management, this even in bearish markets, with a relatively low correlation with other \\ninvestment opportunities. \\nHedge funds may present some restrictions on investing (size, duration, etc.). Funds\\nof funds allow a larger number of investors to invest in hedge funds. The funds of funds \\npick up the best hedge fund managers and package their products to be offered to a wide \\nnumber of investors.\\nLast but not least are private equity funds that invest mainly in non-listed firms at \\ndifferent stages of maturity.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nThere are various risks involved in ﬁnancial securities. There are economic risks (political, \\ninﬂation, etc.) which threaten cash ﬂows from ﬁnancial securities and which come from the \\n“real economy”, and there are ﬁnancial risks (liquidity, currency, interest rate and other risks) \\nwhich do not directly affect cash ﬂow and come under the ﬁnancial sphere.\\nAll risks, regardless of their nature, lead to ﬂuctuations in the value of a ﬁnancial \\nsecurity.\\nIn a market economy, a security’s risk is measured in terms of the volatility of its price (or of \\nits rate of return). The greater the volatility, the greater the risk, and vice versa.\\nWe can break down the total risk of a ﬁnancial security into the market-related risk (market \\nor systematic risk) and a speciﬁc risk that is independent of the market (intrinsic or diversiﬁ-\\nable risk).

Those portfolios that are \\nlocated on the portion of the curve known as the efﬁcient frontier will deliver better returns \\nthan those portfolios which are not. However, given portfolios located on the efﬁcient fron-\\ntier curve, it is impossible to choose an optimal portfolio objectively from among them. The \\nchoice then becomes an individual one, and every investor chooses the portfolio according \\nto his personal appetite for (or aversion to) risk.\\nBy including risk-free assets, i.e. assets on which the return is guaranteed such as govern-\\nment bonds, it is possible to obtain portfolios that are even more efﬁcient.\\nThe inclusion of a risk-free asset in a portfolio leads to the creation of a new efﬁcient frontier \\nwhich is the line linking the risk-free asset to the market portfolio in the risk/returns space. \\nThis new line is called the capital market line.

It also highlighted the notion of risk premium (i.e. the difference between the \\nrisk-free rate and the return on the market portfolio); this chapter continues to explore \\nthe risk premium in greater depth.\\nBy seeking systematically to estimate the risk premium, i.e. in a fairly valued market, \\nthe question arises: what risk premium must be added to the risk-free rate to determine \\nthe required rate of return?\\nInvestors must look at the big picture, first by investing in the market portfolio, then \\nby borrowing or by investing in risk-free instruments commensurate with the level of risk \\nthey wish to assume. This approach allows them to assess an investment by merely deter-\\nmining the additional return and risk it adds to the market portfolio.\\nInvestment risk is often broken down into its component parts, not necessarily in eco-\\nnomic and ﬁnancial terms, but rather into the volatility of the security itself and the \\nvolatility of the market as a whole.\\nWe now want to know how to get from r (the discounting rate used in calculating \\ncompany value) to k (the return required by investors on a specific security).\\nRemember that this approach applies only if the investor owns a perfectly diversified \\nportfolio.\\nHere is why: the greater the risk assumed by the financial investor, the higher his \\nrequired rate of return. However, if he makes just one investment and that turns out to be a \\nfailure, his required rate of return will matter little, as he will have lost everything.\\nWith this in mind, it is easier to understand that risk premium is relevant only if \\nthe financial investor manages not just a single investment, but a diversified portfolio \\nof investments. In this case, the failure of one investment should be offset by the return \\nachieved by other investments, which should thereby produce a suitable return for the \\nportfolio as a whole.\\nThe concept of risk premium only makes sense when risk is spread over many investments. \\nThe ideas of portfolio management and of diversiﬁcation are at the heart of ﬁnance. They \\nare key to understanding how a commercial bank or an insurance company works.\\nThis is the main difference between an industrial investment and a financial investment.'),\n",

As his assets are not diversified, it is a matter of “life or \\ndeath” for the firm that the investment succeeds. The law of averages in risk diversifica-\\ntion does not apply to him.1\\nThe financial investor, on the other hand, needs portfolio management tools to esti-\\nmate the risk–return on each of his investments. Portfolio theory is not the main objective \\nhere, but it is useful to introduce some basic notions with which financial managers must \\nbe familiar.\\nSection 19.1\\nRETURN  REQUIRED  BY INVESTORS : THE  CAPM\\nThe CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) was developed in the late 1950s and 1960s. \\nBased on the work of Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe, John Lintner and Jack Treynor, \\nit is now universally applied.\\nThe CAPM is based on the assumption that investors act rationally and have at \\ntheir disposal all relevant information on financial securities (see “efficient markets” \\nin Chapter 15). Like the investor in Chapter 18, they seek to maximise their return, at a \\ngiven level of risk.\\nThe capital market line that we described in the previous chapter set the relation \\nfor the return of a portfolio. CAPM aims at defining the same relation but for a specific \\nsecurity (and not for a portfolio) in order to determine the return required for this security \\ndepending on its risk. \\nRemember that in order to minimise total risk, investors seek to reduce that compo-\\nnent which can be reduced, i.e. the specific risk. They do so by diversifying their portfolios.\\nAs a result, when stocks are fairly valued, investors will receive a return only on the \\nportion of risk that they cannot eliminate – the market risk, or the non-diversifiable risk. \\nIndeed, in a market in which arbitrage is theoretically possible, they will not be amply \\nremunerated for a risk that they could otherwise eliminate themselves by simply diversi-\\nfying their portfolios.\\nPortfolio theory’s essential contribution is to show that an investor’s required rate of \\nreturn is not linked to total risk, but solely to market risk. Conversely, in a fairly valued \\nmarket, intrinsic, or diversiﬁable, risk is not remunerated.\\nThis means that the required rate of return (k) is equal to the risk-free rate rF,2 plus the risk \\npremium for the non-diversifiable risk, i.e. the market risk.\\nThis can be expressed as follows:\\n1 However, the \\nvery fact that \\nhe does not \\ndiversify his \\nportfolio means \\nthat he must \\nachieve strong \\nperformances \\nin managing the \\ncompany, as he \\nhas everything \\nto lose. So he’s \\nlikely to take \\nsteps to reduce \\nrisk.\\n2 For the risk-\\nfree rate, kF is \\nequal to rF. The \\nrequired rate of \\nreturn is equal to \\nthe return that is \\nactually received, \\nas the asset has \\nno risk.\\xa0\\nRequired rate of return = risk-free rate market risk premi+×β uum, or:\\n(kr k r=+ × −FM F β )\\nWhere kM is the required rate of return for the market and β the sensitivity coefficient \\ndescribed previously.'),\n",

For example, a cut in interest rates \\nnormally leads to a downward shift and thus a general appreciation of all stocks;\\nt a non-parallel shift (or pivoting) reflects a change in the risk premium and thus in the \\nremuneration of risk. In this case, the riskiest stocks will move the most, whereas the \\nleast risky stocks may not be significantly affected.'),\n",

But financial analysts are always quick to criticise and thus \\nthis section appeases the critics by summarising how the CAPM presents some problems \\nin practice.\\n1/ THE LIMITS OF DIVERSIFICATION\\nThe CAPM is a development of portfolio theory and is based on the assumption that \\ndiversification helps to reduce risk (to the non-diversifiable risk). A study by Campbell \\net al. (2001) shows that diversification is increasingly complex and that, whereas in the \\n1970s a portfolio of 20 stocks reduced risk significantly, today at least 50 are required to \\nachieve the same result.\\nThis is due, among other things, to the greater volatility of individual stocks, although \\nmarkets as a whole are no more volatile. Other reasons for this phenomenon are the arrival \\non the market of riskier companies, such as biotechnology, Internet and younger compa-\\nnies, and the dwindling prominence of conglomerates which, by nature, provided some \\ndiversification in and of themselves.\\nMeanwhile, the correlation between market return and return on individual stocks is \\nfalling. This may undermine the relevancy of the CAPM. Statistically, beta is becoming \\nless and less relevant.\\n2/ DIFFICULTIES IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE CAPM\\nThe first difficulty one encounters when using the CAPM is determining the risk-free rate \\nwhich, all things considered, is just a theoretical concept.\\nPractitioners usually use as a risk-free rate the yield of long-term government bonds. \\nThey put forward the similar weighted average duration of the cash flows of the assets \\nto be valued and of long-term bonds. The issue is that long-term government bonds are \\nnot without risk: their value can fluctuate in time depending on changes in interest rates \\n(which is inevitable given the long period of time since their issue). Even investors that \\nplan to keep government bonds until their maturity suffer from these interest rate fluctua-\\ntions for the reinvestment of coupons. In addition, unanticipated changes in inflation can \\nimpact what could have appeared as a risk-free investment. Finally, there remains the '),\n",

The increasing levels of debt of most western countries mean \\nthat this risk is not just theoretical, as demonstrated in recent years.\\nTherefore it appears more rational to use as a risk-free rate the short-term interest \\nrate. Short-term bills are virtually not impacted by changes in interest, coupon reinvest-\\nment risk does not exist and bankruptcy risk is minor.\\nThe three key global providers of equity market risk premium data (Ibbotson, \\nDimson-Marsh-Staunton and Associés en Finance) propose a computation of the market \\nrisk premium based on long-term interest rates or short-term interest rates. The most \\nimportant factor is not to add a short-term interest rate to a market premium computed on \\nthe basis of long-term rates or the reverse.\\nRoll (1997) has pointed out that determining a market portfolio is not as easy as one \\nwould like to think. In theory, the market portfolio is not solely made up of stocks nor \\neven just financial assets, but of all the assets that can be acquired. It is therefore impos-\\nsible, in practice, to come up with a true market portfolio, especially when looking at it \\nfrom an international point of view.\\nHowever, this is not an insurmountable obstacle. Indeed, in a portfolio already con-\\ntaining a large number of assets, the marginal contribution to return of a new asset is low. \\nPortfolio diversification makes return and risk approach a limit – the return offered by a \\ntheoretically ideal market portfolio. So the market portfolio can be approximated with a \\nportfolio containing “only” a large number of assets. Unfortunately, recent studies have \\nshown that more and more assets must be included in a portfolio for it to be considered \\nhighly diversified.\\nHowever, we still have to determine the return expected from the market portfolio. As \\nthe CAPM is used for making forecasts, it can also be used to calculate the return expected \\nfrom a security based upon the return expected from the market portfolio, as well as the \\nsecurity’s anticipated risk (its β). However, “anticipated” data cannot be observed directly \\nin the market, and so forecasts must be made on the basis of historical data and macroeco-\\nnomic data. For some countries, such as emerging nations, this is not easy!\\n3/ THE FORECAST β\\nThe main criticism of beta is its instability over time. It boils down a large amount of \\ninformation into a single figure, and this strength becomes its weakness.\\nThe CAPM is used to make forecasts. It can be used to calculate expected return on \\nthe basis of anticipated risk. Therefore, it would be better to use a forecast β rather than a \\nhistorical value, especially when the coefficient is not stable over time.\\nFor this reason, calculations must often be adjusted to reflect the regularity of earn-\\nings and dividends, and visibility on the sector. Blume (1975) has sought to demonstrate \\na convergence of β towards 1. This seems counter-intuitive to us as some sectors will \\nalways have a beta greater than 1. In addition, the recent crisis has demonstrated that, in \\ndifficult times, the gap between high β and low β increases.\\n4/ THE THEORETICAL LIMITS OF CAPM AND MARKETS AT FAIR VALUE\\nThe CAPM assumes markets are fairly valued. But markets are not necessarily always \\nat fair value. The fact that technical analysis has become so prominent on trading '),\n",

To be applicable, \\nthe model must be accepted by everyone as being universally correct. The development \\nof parallel theories shows that this is not necessarily the case.\\nThe bias mentioned above has led the CAPM to be considered as just one theo-\\nretical explanation for the functioning of the financial markets. Other theories and \\nmethods have been developed, but they have not (yet?) achieved the attractiveness of \\nthe CAPM, due to the simplicity of its concepts. We should not lose hope: a study by \\nFerguson and Shockley (2003) posits that all weaknesses of the CAPM could be attrib-\\nutable to a mis-estimation of the market portfolio and that they would disappear if not \\nonly stocks, but also bonds (and other investment opportunities), were included as the \\ntheory suggests.\\nSection 19.4\\nMULTIFACTOR  MODELS\\n1/ THE ARBITRAGE  PRICING  THEORY  (APT)\\nIn some ways, the APT (Arbitrage Pricing Theory) model is an extended version of the \\nCAPM. The CAPM assumes that the return on a security is a function of its market risk \\nand therefore depends on a single factor: market prices. The APT model, as proposed by \\nStephen Ross, assumes that the risk premium is a function of several variables, not just \\none, i.e. macroeconomic variables (V1,V2, . . . ,Vn), as well as company “noise”.\\nSo, for security J:\\nr rb r b rVV n V nJ a b Company- specific Variable=+ × + × + … + × +12 12\\nThe model does not stipulate which V factors are to be used. Ross’s original article uses \\nthe following factors, which are based on quantitative analyses: inflation, manufacturing \\noutput, risk premium, and yield curve.\\nComparing the APT model to the market portfolio, we can see that APT has replaced \\nthe notion (hard to measure in practice) of return expected by the market with a series of \\nvariables which, unfortunately, must still be determined. This is why APT is a portfolio \\nmanagement tool and not a tool for valuing stocks.\\n2/ THE FAMA –FRENCH  MODEL\\nThere are offshoots from the APT that have sought to explain historical returns by com-\\npany-specific factors rather than the general macroeconomic factors in the APT. \\nFor example, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French (1995) have isolated three factors: \\nmarket return (as in the CAPM), price/book value (see Chapter 31), and the gap in returns \\nbetween large caps and small caps (which lends credence to the notion of a liquidity effect).\\nOther factors can be added to this list, including P/E, market capitalisation, yield \\nand even past performance (which is a direct contradiction of efficient market theory).

While \\nthey criticise the CAPM, they offer no better alternative model.\\n3/ LIQUIDITY  PREMIUM , SIZE  PREMIUM  AND  INVESTOR  PROTECTION\\nAmong factors used in determining risk, the criteria by which liquidity can be measured \\n(size, free float, transaction volumes, bid–ask spread) are often statistically significant. In \\nother words, the required return on a security often appears to be a function of liquidity.\\nHamon and Jacquillat (1999) have demonstrated the existence of a liquidity premium \\nin Europe, which is nil for large caps and significant for small caps. The liquidity pre-\\nmium should be added to the return derived from the CAPM to arrive at the total return \\nexpected by the shareholder. Hamon and Jacquillat use the term “market plane” (instead \\nof securities market line). Under their model, expected return on a security is a linear \\nequation with two parameters: the market premium and the liquidity premium.

It therefore assumes that there is an equilibrium between offer and demand and \\nthat it is reached at every moment on financial markets (thanks to the arbitrage principle). \\nFrom this equilibrium, no one can predict how prices will move: they follow a random path.\\nSome research proposes that market prices do not follow random paths as the market \\nin equilibrium theory predicts. In particular, extreme events (strong price growth or large \\ndrops) occur much more frequently than would be predicted by classical theory.\\nSeveral theories have been developed to model the evolution of prices and allow for \\npossible massive price movements (in particular, crashes).\\nSome have tried to use chaotic functions to model prices. Chaotic here does not mean \\nillogical or random. The term is used for perfectly predictable series of data that appear to \\nbe illogical. These models are used in a number of sciences including economics.\\nMandelbrot has put forward that fractals (or to be more precise multi-fractals) could \\nprovide accurate representations of market price movements. This assumption does not fit \\nwith the efficient market theory, not only because the statistical rule for modelling prices \\nis different but more importantly because Mandelbrot’s assumptions imply that prices \\nhave memory, i.e. that they are not independent from past prices.\\nSection 19.6\\nTERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES\\nConventional financial theory, portfolio theory and the CAPM, are concerned with the notion \\nof interest rates and reducing them to the level of a factor that is exogenous to their models, \\nnamely the risk-free rate. But the risk-free rate is by no means a given variable, and there is \\nno financial instrument in existence which allows investors to completely escape risk.\\nMoreover, because it is a single-period model, the CAPM draws no distinction \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates. As has been discussed, a money-market \\nfund does not offer the same annual rate of return as a 10-year bond. An entire body of \\nfinancial research is devoted to understanding movements in interest rates and, in particu-\\nlar, how different maturities are linked. This is the study of how the yield curve is formed.\\n1/ THE VARIOUS YIELD CURVES\\nBy charting the interest rate for the same categories of risk at all maturities, the investor \\nobtains the yield curve that reflects the anticipation of all financial market operators.\\nThe concept of premium helps explain why the interest rate of any financial asset is \\ngenerally proportional to its maturity.\\nGenerally speaking, the yield curve reflects the market’s anticipation regarding:\\nt long-term inflation;\\nt the central bank’s monetary policy; and\\nt the issuing country’s debt management policy.'),\n",

The steepness of the \\nnegative slope depends on:\\nthow strong expectations of recovery are;\\nt how credible the central bank’s policy is (i.e. how firm the central banks are in fight-\\ning inflation); and\\nt the extent to which inflationary trends appear to be diminishing (despite the reces-\\nsion, if inflationary trends are very strong then long-term rates will tend to remain \\nstable, and the curve could actually be flat for some time).\\nThis is what could be observed in June 2008 when, due to the lack of liquidity, short-term \\neuro and British pound interest rates were above long-term interest rates.\\nLastly, when rates are low, the curve cannot remain flat for any length of time because \\ninvestors will buy fixed-rate bonds. As long as investors expect that their capital gain, which \\nis tied to falling long-term rates, is more than the cost of short-term financing, then they will \\ncontinue to purchase the fixed-rate bonds. However, when long-term rates seem to have \\nreached a lower limit, these expectations will disappear because investors will demand a dif-\\nferential between long-term and short-term rates’ yield on their investment. This results in:\\nteither a rebound in long-term rates; or\\nt stable long-term rates if short-term rates fall because of central bank policies; and\\nt a steepening in the curve, the degree of which will depend on the currency.\\nWe saw such a movement back to the upward slope at the end of 2008 for the Swiss franc.\\n2/ RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTEREST RATES AND MATURITIES\\nBy no means are short-term and long-term rates completely disconnected. In fact, there is \\na fundamental and direct link between them.\\nAbout 20 years ago, this relationship was less apparent and common consensus \\nfavoured the theory of segmentation, which said that supply and demand balanced out \\nacross markets, with no connection among them, i.e. the long-term bond market and the \\nshort-term bond market.\\nAs seen above, this theory is generally no longer valid, even though each inves-\\ntor will tend to focus on his own timeframe. It is worthwhile reviewing the basic \\nmechanisms. For example, an investor who wishes to invest on a two-year time basis has \\ntwo options:\\nthe invests for two years at today’s fixed rate, which is the interest rate for any two-\\nyear investment; or\\nt he invests the funds for one year, is paid the one-year interest rate at the end of the \\nyear, and then repeats the operation.'),\n",

This does not deal with the \\nattention that investors pay to liquidity, as demonstrated by recent events on financial \\nmarkets.\\n3/ TAKING  LIQUIDITY  INTO  CONSIDERATION\\nThe first theories to highlight the existence of a premium to reflect the relative lack of \\nliquidity of long-term investments were the preferred habitat theory and the liquidity \\npreference theory.\\nIn the mid-1960s, Modigliani and Sutch advanced the theory of preferred habitat, \\nwhich says that investors prefer certain investment timeframes. Companies that wish to \\nissue securities whose timeframe is considered undesirable will thus have to pay a pre-\\nmium to attract investors.\\nThe theory of liquidity preference is based on the same assumption, but goes further \\nin assuming that the preferred habitat of all investors is the short term. Investors preferring \\nliquidity will require a liquidity premium if they are to invest for the long term. \\nHence, long-term rates will be the geometric average of anticipated short-term rates \\nincreased by a liquidity premium normally increasing with maturity. \\nEven if investors anticipate fixed short-term rates, the yield curve will slope upward due \\nto the liquidity premiums.'),\n",

The investor’s required rate of return is not linked to total risk, but solely \\nto market risk. Conversely, in a market in equilibrium, intrinsic – or diversiﬁable – risk is not \\nremunerated.\\nThe CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) is used to determine the rate of return required by \\nan investor.\\nRisk-free rate + β × market risk premium, or:\\nk r= FM F+× (−β kr )\\nAlthough the CAPM is used universally, it does have drawbacks that are either practical (for \\nreliable determination of beta coefﬁcients) or fundamental in nature (since it supposes that \\nmarkets are in equilibrium). This criticism has led to the development of new models, such \\nas the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and has highlighted the importance of the liquidity \\npremium for groups with small free ﬂoats. Like the CAPM, the APT assumes that the required \\nrate of return no longer depends on a single market rate; however, it considers a number of \\nother variables too, such as the difference between government bonds and Treasury bills, \\nunanticipated changes in the growth rate of the economy or the rate of inﬂation, etc.\\nRates of return on bonds with different maturity dates can be plotted on a graph known as \\nthe yield curve. In order to avoid distortions linked to coupon rates of bonds, it is better to \\nanalyse zero-coupon curves that can be reconstituted on the basis of the yield curve.\\nThe shape of the yield curve depends on changes in expectations about short-term rates \\nand the liquidity premium that investors will require for making a long-term investment. In \\na risk-free environment, the long-term rate at n years is a geometric average of short-term \\nrates anticipated for future periods. Generally, there is a positive link between the interest \\nrate of a ﬁnancial asset and its duration, which is where the rising yield curves come from. \\nHowever, the yield curve can also slope the other way, especially during a recession.\\nSUMMARY\\n4/ YIELD  CURVES  AND  VALUATION  OF  SECURITIES\\nAfter having studied the yield curve, it is easier to understand that the discounting of \\nall the cash flows from a fixed-income security at a single rate, regardless of the period \\nwhen they are paid, is an oversimplification, although this is the method that will be used \\nthroughout this text for stocks and capital expenditure. It would be wrong to use it for \\nfixed-income securities.\\nIn order to be more rigorous, it is necessary to discount each flow with the interest \\nrate of the yield curve corresponding to its maturity: the one-year rate for next year’s \\nincome stream, the three-year rate for flows paid in three years, etc. Ultimately, yield to \\nmaturity is similar to an average of these different rates.\\n 1/  Explain in a few lines why diversifiable risk cannot be remunerated on markets in \\nequilibrium.\\n 2/  Given that diversifiable risk is not remunerated, would it be worthwhile to diversify an \\ninvestment?\\nQUESTIONS'),\n",

If the maturity of the security is over one year \\nit will be called a bond.\\nThis obligation provides for a schedule of cash flows defining the terms of repayment \\nof the funds and the lender’s remuneration in the interval. The remuneration may be fixed \\nduring the life of the debt or floating if it is linked to a benchmark or index.\\nUnlike conventional bank loans, debt securities can be traded on secondary mar-\\nkets (stock exchanges, money markets, mortgage markets and interbank markets), but \\ntheir logic is the same and all the reasoning presented in this chapter also apply for bank \\nloans. Debt securities are bonds, commercial paper, Treasury bills and notes, certificates \\nof deposit and mortgage-backed bonds or mortgage bonds. Furthermore, the current trend \\nis to securitise loans to make them negotiable.\\nDisintermediation was not the only factor fuelling the growth of bond markets. The \\nincreasing difficulty of obtaining bank loans was another, as banks realised that the inter-\\nest margin on such loans did not offer sufficient return on equity.

Of course, these higher returns come at the cost of higher risks.\\nMany of the explanations and examples offered in this chapter deal with bonds, but \\nthey can easily be applied to all kinds of debt instruments. We shall take the example of \\nthe India Motors February 2014 bond issue with the following features.\\nINDIA MOTORS – 4.25% FEBRUARY 2014–FEBRUARY 2021 BOND ISSUE\\nAmount:€300 000 000\\nDenomination: €50 000\\nIssue price: 99.532% or €49 766 per bond, payable in one instalment on the \\nsettlement date.\\nDate of issue: 24 February 2014.\\nSettlement date: 24 February 2014.\\nMaturity: 7 years.\\nAnnual coupon: 4.25%, i.e. €2125 per bond payable in one instalment on 24 \\nFebruary of each year, with the ﬁrst payment on 24 February 2015.\\nYield to maturity for \\nthe subscriber:\\n4.33% on the settlement date.\\nAverage life: 7 years.\\nNormal redemption \\ndate:\\nThe bonds will be redeemed in full on 24 February 2021 at par \\nvalue.\\nGuarantee: No guarantee.\\nFurther issues \\n(fungibility):\\nThe issuer may, without prior permission from the bondholders, \\ncreate and issue new bonds with the same features as the present \\nbonds with the exception of the issue price and the ﬁrst coupon \\npayment date. The present bonds could thus be exchanged for the \\nnew bonds.\\nRating: BBB (Standard & Poor’s) for this issue\\nListing: Luxembourg.\\nSection 20.1\\nBASIC CONCEPTS\\n1/ THE PRINCIPAL\\n(a) Nominal or face value\\nLoans that can be publicly traded are divided into a certain number of units giving the \\nsame rights for the same fraction of the debt. This is the nominal, face or par value, which, \\nfor bonds, is generally €1000 but is €50 000 in the India Motors case.\\nThe nominal value is used to calculate the interest payments. In the simplest cases, \\nit equals the amount of money the issuer received for each bond and that the issuer will \\nrepay upon redemption.'),\n",

The India Motors bond was issued on 24 February 2014 at a price of €49 \\n766, i.e. 99.532% of its face value.\\nDepending on the characteristics of the issue, the issue price may be higher than the \\nface value (issued at a premium), lower than the face value (issued at a discount) or equal \\nto the face value (at par).\\n(c) Redemption\\nWhen a loan is amortised, it is said to be redeemed. In Chapter 17 we looked at the various \\nways a loan can be repaid:\\n t redemption at maturity, or on a bullet repayment basis. This is the case in the India \\nMotors issue;\\n t redemption in equal slices (or series), or constant amortisation;\\n t redemption in fixed instalments.\\nOther methods exist, such as determining which bonds are redeemed by lottery… \\nthere is no end to financial creativity!\\nA deferred redemption period is a grace period, generally at the beginning of the \\nbond’s life, during which the issuer does not have to repay the principal.\\nThe terms of the issue may also include provisions for early redemption (call \\noptions) or retraction (put options). A call option gives the issuer the right to buy back all \\nor part of the issue prior to the maturity date, while a put option allows the bondholder to \\ndemand early repayment.\\nNo such options are included in the India Motors issue.\\nA redemption premium or discount arises where the redemption value is higher or \\nlower than the nominal value.\\n(d) Maturity of the bond\\nThe life of a bond extends from its issue date to its final redemption date. Where the bond \\nis redeemed in several instalments, the average maturity of the bond corresponds to the \\naverage of each of the repayment periods.\\nAverage maturity\\nt\\n==\\n×\\nAverage life\\nNumber of bonds redeemed during yeear\\nTotal number of bonds to be redeemed\\nt\\nt\\nN\\n−\\n∑\\n1\\nwhere t is the variable for the year and N the total number of periods.\\nThe India Motors bonds have a maturity of seven years.\\n(e) Guarantees\\nRepayment of the principal (and interest) on a bond borrowing can be guaranteed by the \\nissuer, the parent company and less often for corporates by collateral (i.e. mortgages), '),\n",

Bonds are rarely secured, while commercial paper and certificates \\nof deposit can, in theory, be secured but in fact never are.\\nThe bonds issued by India Motors are not guaranteed.\\n2/ INCOME\\n(a) Issue date\\nThe issue date is the date on which interest begins to accrue. It may or may not coincide \\nwith the settlement date, when investors actually pay for the bonds purchased.\\nInterest on the India Motors bond begins to accrue on the settlement date.\\n(b) Interest rate\\nThe coupon or nominal rate is used to calculate the interest (or coupon in the case of a \\nbond) payable to the lenders. Interest is calculated by multiplying the nominal rate by the \\nnominal or par value of the bond.\\nOn the India Motors issue, the coupon rate is 4.25% and the coupon payment €2125.\\nIn addition to coupon payments, investors may also gain additional remuneration if \\nthe issue price is lower than the par value. On the India Motors issue, investors paid €49\\n766 for each bond, whereas interest was based on a par value of €50 000 and the bond \\nwill be redeemed at €50 000. In this case, the bond sold at a discount.\\n(c) Periodicity of coupon payments\\nCoupon payments can be made every year, half-year, quarter, month or even more fre-\\nquently. On certain borrowings, the interval is longer, since the total compounded interest \\nearned is paid only upon redemption. Such bonds are called zero-coupon bonds.\\nIn some cases, the interest is prepaid; that is, the company pays the interest at the \\nbeginning of the period to which it relates. In general, however, the accrued interest is \\npaid at the end of the period to which it relates.\\nThe India Motors issue pays accrued interest on an annual basis.\\nSection 20.2\\nTHE YIELD TO MATURITY\\nThe actual return on an investment (or the cost of a loan for the borrower) depends on a \\nnumber of factors: the difference between the settlement date and the issue date, the issue \\npremium/discount, the redemption premium/discount, the deferred redemption period \\nand the coupon payment interval. As a result, the nominal rate is not very meaningful.\\nWe have seen that the yield to maturity (see Chapter 17) cancels out the bond’s pres-\\nent net value; that is, the difference between the issue price and the present value of future \\nflows on the bond. Note that for bonds, the yield to maturity (y) and the internal rate \\nof return are identical. This yield is calculated on the settlement date when investors \\npay for their bonds, and is always indicated in the prospectus for bond issues. The yield \\nto maturity takes into account any timing differences between the right to receive income \\nand the actual cash payment.'),\n",

For the issuer, the gross cost \\nto maturity is higher because of the commissions paid to intermediaries. This increases \\nthe actuarial cost of the borrowing. In addition, the issuer pays the intermediaries (paying \\nagents) in charge of paying the interest and reimbursing the principal. Lastly, the issuer \\ncan deduct the coupon payments from its corporate income tax, thus reducing the actual \\ncost of the loan.\\n1/ SPREADS\\nThe spread is the difference between the rate of return on a bond and that on a benchmark \\nused by the market. In the euro area, the benchmark for long-term debt is most often the \\nInterest Rate Swap (IRS) rate; sometimes the spread to government bond yields is also \\nmentioned. For floating-rate bonds and bank loans (which are most often with floating \\nrates), the spread is measured to a short-term rate, the three- or six-month Euribor in the \\neurozone.\\nThe India Motors bond was issued with a spread of 135 basis points (1.35%) to mid \\nswap rate, meaning that India Motors had to pay 1.35% more than banks per year to \\nraise funds.\\nThe spread is a key parameter for valuing bonds, particularly at the time of issue. It \\ndepends on the perceived credit quality of the issuer and the maturity of the issue, which \\nare reflected in the credit rating and the guarantees given. Spreads are, of course, a relative \\nconcept, depending on the bonds being compared. The stronger the creditworthiness of \\nthe issuer and the market’s appetite for risk, the lower the margin will be.1\\n2/ THE SECONDARY  MARKET\\nOnce the subscription period is over, the price at which the bonds were sold (their issue \\nprice) becomes a thing of the past. The value of the instrument begins to fluctuate on the \\nsecondary market. Consequently, the yield to maturity published in the prospectus applies \\nonly at the time of issue; after that, it fluctuates in step with the value of the bond.\\nTheoretically, changes in the bond’s yield to maturity on the secondary market do \\nnot directly concern the borrower, since the cost of the debt was fixed when it was \\ncontracted.\\n1 An interesting \\nstudy on yield \\nspreads in major \\nfinancial areas \\nis periodically \\npublished by the \\nInternational \\nMonetary Fund \\nand can be freely \\nobtained at www.\\nimf.org.'),\n",

In fact, they are treated as though the nominal value of each bond were €100. Thus, \\na bond with a nominal value of €50 000 will not be listed at €49 500 but at 99% (49 \\n500/50 000 × 100). Similarly, a bond with a nominal value of €10 000 will be listed at \\n99%, rather than €9900. This makes it easier to compare bond prices.\\nFor the comparison to be relevant, the prices must not include the fraction of annual \\ninterest already accrued. Otherwise, the price of a bond with a 15% coupon would be 115 \\njust before its coupon payment date and 100 just after. This is why bonds are quoted net\\nof accrued interest. Bond tables thus show both the price expressed as a percentage of \\nthe nominal value and the fraction of accrued interest, which is also given as a percentage \\nof the nominal value.\\nThe table below indicates that on April 2014, the India Motors bond traded at 100.7% \\nwith an accrued interest of 0.42%. This means that at that date the bond cost €50 600, \\ni.e.: €50 000 × (100.7% + 0.42%).\\nPrice Bond ticker Gross \\nYTM\\nMaturity Maturity\\ndate\\nModiﬁed\\nduration\\nDuration Accrued\\ninterest\\nNext coupon \\npayment\\n100.7% IN0010859686 4.13 % 6.90 years 24/02/21 5.86 6.10 0.42% 24/02/15\\nCertain debt securities, mainly fixed-rate Treasury notes with annual interest payments, \\nare quoted at their yield to maturity. The two listing methods are rigorously equivalent and \\nonly require a simple calculation to switch from one to the other.\\nBy now, you have probably realised that the price of a bond does not reflect its actual \\ncost. A bond trading at 105% may be more or less expensive than a bond trading at 96%.\\nThe yield to maturity is the most important criterion, allowing investors to evaluate \\nvarious investment opportunities according to the degree of risk they are willing \\nto accept and the length of their investment. However, it merely offers a temporary \\nestimate of the promised return; this may be different from the expected return which \\nincorporates the probability of default of the bond.\\n4/ FURTHER ISSUES AND ASSIMILATION\\nHaving made one bond issue, the same company can later issue other bonds with the same \\nfeatures (time to maturity, coupon rate, coupon payment schedule, redemption price and \\nguarantees, etc.) so that they are interchangeable. This enables the various issues to be \\ngrouped as one, for a larger total amount.

The cash flow schedule for \\nthese securities is laid down clearly when they are issued, whereas the securities that we \\nwill be describing in this section give rise to cash flows that are not totally fixed from the \\nvery outset, but follow preset rules.\\nFixed Rate\\n83%\\nFloating Rate\\n17%\\nSplit of euro-denominated bond issues in 2013\\nSource: Dealogic\\n1/ THE MECHANICS  OF THE  COUPON\\nThe coupon of a floating-rate bond is not fixed, but is indexed to an observable market \\nrate, generally a short-term rate, such as a six-month Euribor. In other words, the coupon \\nrate is periodically reset based on some reference rate plus a spread. When each coupon \\nis presented for payment, its value is calculated as a function of the market rate, based on \\nthe formula:\\nCoupon Market rate Spread Par valuett = () +×\\nThis cancels out the interest rate risk since the issuer of the security is certain of paying \\ninterest at exactly the market rate at all times. Likewise, the investor is assured at all times \\nof receiving a return in line with the market rate. Consequently, there is no reason for \\nthe price of a variable-rate bond to move very far from its par value unless the issuer’s \\nsolvency becomes a concern.\\nLet’s take the simple example of a fixed-rate bond indexed to the one-year rate that \\npays interest annually. On the day following payment of the coupon and in the year prior '),\n",

Likewise, we could demonstrate that the price of the bond is \\n100% on each coupon payment date. The price of the bond will fluctuate in the same way \\nas a short-term instrument in between coupon payment dates.\\nIf the reference rate covers a period which is not the same as the interval between two \\ncoupon payments, the situation becomes slightly more complex. That said, since there \\nis rarely a big difference between short-term rates, the price of the bond will clearly not \\nfluctuate much over time.\\nThe main factor that can push the price of a variable-rate bond well below its par \\nvalue is a deterioration in the solvency of the issuer.\\nConsequently, ﬂoating-rate bonds are not highly volatile securities, even though their \\nvalue is not always exactly 100%.\\n2/ THE SPREAD\\nLike those issuing fixed-rate securities, companies issuing floating-rate securities need \\nto pay investors a return that covers the counterparty (credit) risk. Consequently, a fixed \\nmargin (spread) is added to the variable percentage when the coupon is calculated. For \\ninstance, a company may issue a bond at three-month Euribor + 0.45% (or 45 basis points). \\nThe size of this margin basically depends on the company’s financial creditworthiness.\\nThe spread is set once and for all when the bond is issued, but of course the com-\\npany’s risk profile may vary over time. This factor, which does not depend on interest rate \\ntrends, slightly increases the volatility of variable-debt securities.\\nThe issue of credit risk is the same for a fixed-rate security as for a variable-income \\nsecurity.\\n3/ INDEX -LINKED  SECURITIES\\nFloating rates, as described in the first paragraph of this section, are indexed to a market \\ninterest rate. Broadly speaking, however, a bond’s coupons may be indexed to any index \\nor price provided that it is clearly defined from a contractual standpoint. Such securities \\nare known as index-linked securities.\\nFor instance, most European countries have issued bonds indexed to inflation. The \\ncoupon paid each year, as well as the redemption price, is reset to take into account the \\nrise in the price index since the bond was launched. As a result, the investor benefits from \\ncomplete protection against inflation. With the advent of the euro, for example, the UK \\ngovernment issued a bond indexed to the rate of inflation in the United Kingdom. Like-\\nwise, Mexican companies have brought to market bonds linked to oil prices, while other \\ncompanies have issued bonds indexed to their own share price.'),\n",

The price of a bond with a modified duration of 4 will increase by \\n4% when interest rates fall from 7% to 6%, while the price of another bond with a modi-\\nfied duration of 3 will increase by just 3%.\\nIn the first scenario, the bondholder would obviously attempt to sell the India Motors \\nbond to buy securities yielding 5.25%. The price of the bond would fall such that the \\nbond offered its buyer a yield to maturity of 5.25%. Conversely, if the market rate fell to \\n3.25%, holders of the India Motors bond would hold onto their bonds. Other investors \\nwould attempt to buy them, and the price of the bond would rise to a level at which the \\nbond offered its buyer a yield to maturity of 3.25%.\\nAn upward (or downward) change in interest rates therefore leads to a fall (or rise) \\nin the present value of a fixed-rate bond, irrespective of the issuer’s financial condition.\\nThe value of a ﬁxed-rate debt instrument is not ﬁxed. It varies inversely with market \\nrates: if interest rates rise, its value declines; if interest rates fall, its value appreciates.\\nAs we have seen, if the yield on our India Motors bond is 4.33%, its price is 99.532.\\nBut if its yield to maturity rises to 4.83% (a 0.5 point increase), its price will change to:\\nV\\ni\\n=\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n=4.25%\\n(1 4.83 % )\\n100%\\n(1 4.83% )\\n96.62%, i.e. a decrei\\n1\\n7\\n7\\n=\\n∑ aase of 2.73%\\nThis shows that holders of bonds face a risk to their capital, and this risk is by no means \\nmerely theoretical given the fluctuations in interest rates over the medium term.\\n0%\\n5%\\n10%\\n15%\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\n80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14\\nLong-term interest rates (10Y government bonds)\\nShort-term interest rates (Interbank overnight rates)\\nLong-term and short-term interest rates in the UK since 1980\\nSource: Datastream'),\n",

It simply involves multiplying the change \\nin interest rates by the bond’s modified duration. A rise in interest rates from 4.33% to \\n4.83% therefore leads to a price decrease of 0.5% × 5.94 = 2.97%, i.e. from 99.532% to \\n99.532 × (1 − 2.97%) = 96.58%.\\nWe note a discrepancy of 0.04% with the price calculated previously (96.62%). Mod-\\nified duration is valid solely at the point where it is calculated (i.e. 4.33% here). The fur-\\nther we move away from this point, the more skewed it becomes. For instance, at a yield \\nof 4.83% it is 5.73 rather than 5.94. This will skew calculation of the new price of the \\nbond, but the distortion will be small if the fluctuation in interest rates is also limited in \\nsize. From a geometrical standpoint, the modified duration is the first derivative of price \\nwith respect to interest rates and it reflects the slope of the tangent to the price/yield curve. \\nSince this forms part of a hyperbolic curve, the slope of the tangent is not constant and \\nmoves in line with interest rates.\\n(c) Parameters inﬂuencing modiﬁed duration\\nLet’s consider the following three bonds:\\nBond A B C\\nCoupon 5% 5% 0%\\nPrice 100 100 100\\nYield to maturity 5% 5% 5%\\nRedemption price 100 100 432.2\\nResidual life 5 years 15 years 30 years\\nHow much are these bonds worth in the event of interest rate fluctuations?\\nMarket interest rates (%) A B C\\n1 119.4 155.5 320.7\\n5 100 100 100\\n10 81.0 62.0 24.8\\n15 66.5 41.5 6.5\\nNote that the longer the maturity of a bond, the greater its sensitivity to a change \\nin interest rates.'),\n",

The closer a bond \\ngets to its maturity date, the closer its price moves towards its redemption value and \\nthe more its sensitivity to interest rates decreases. Conversely, the longer it is until the \\nbond matures, the greater its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.\\nModified duration also depends on two other parameters, which are nonetheless of \\nsecondary importance to the time-to-maturity factor:\\ntthe bond’s coupon rate: the lower the coupon rate, the higher its modified duration;\\nt market rates : the lower the level of market rates, the higher a bond’s modified \\nduration.\\nModified duration represents an investment tool used systematically by fixed-income \\nportfolio managers. If they anticipate a decline in interest rates, they opt for bonds with \\na higher modified duration, i.e. a longer time to maturity and a very low coupon rate, or \\neven zero-coupon bonds, to maximise their capital gains.\\nConversely, if portfolio managers expect a rise in interest rates, they focus on bonds \\nwith a low modified duration (i.e. due to mature shortly and carrying a high coupon) in \\norder to minimise their capital losses.\\nConvexity is the second derivative of price with respect to interest rates. It measures \\nthe relative change in a bond’s modified duration for a small fluctuation in interest \\nrates. Convexity expresses the speed of appreciation or the sluggishness of depreciation \\nin the price of the bond if interest rates decline or rise.\\n2/ COUPON REINVESTMENT RISK\\nAs we have seen, the holder of a bond does not know at what rate its coupons will be rein-\\nvested throughout the bond’s lifetime. Only zero-coupon bonds afford protection against \\nthis risk, simply because they do not carry any coupons!\\nFirst of all, note that this risk factor is the mirror image of the previous one. If interest \\nrates rise, the investor suffers a capital loss, but is able to reinvest coupon payments at a \\nhigher rate than the initial yield to maturity. Conversely, a fall in interest rates leads to a \\nloss on the reinvestment of coupons and to a capital gain.\\nIntuitively, it seems clear that for any fixed-income debt portfolio or security, there \\nis a period over which:\\ntthe loss on the reinvestment of coupons will be offset by the capital gain on the sale \\nof the bond if interest rates decline;\\nt the gain on the reinvestment of coupons will be offset by the capital loss on the sale \\nof the bond if interest rates rise.\\nAll in all, once this period ends, the overall value of the portfolio (i.e. bonds plus rein-\\nvested coupons) is the same, and the investors will have achieved a return on investment \\nidentical to the yield to maturity indicated when the bond was issued.\\nIn such circumstances, the portfolio is said to be immunised, i.e. it is protected \\nagainst the risk of fluctuations in interest rates (capital risk and coupon reinvestment risk). \\nThis time period is known as the duration of a bond. It may be calculated at any time, \\neither at issue or throughout the whole life of the bond.'),\n",

The reader will now dis-\\ncover that there are actually a very large number of products that follow the same logic as \\nthat of a bond: remuneration independent from the financial performance of the firm and \\na commitment to reimburse.\\nSection 21.1\\nMARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES\\n1/ SHORT -TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES\\nThe term bond (see previous chapter) is used to refer to marketable securities with matu-\\nrity of over one year, but firms can also issue shorter-term instruments. Commercial \\npaper refers to negotiable debt securities issued on the money market by companies for \\nperiods ranging from one day to one year. In practice, the average maturity of commercial \\npaper is very short, between one and three months. Issuers can also launch paper denomi-\\nnated in foreign currency. Two markets of similar size are active on the European level:\\ntThe ECP (European Commercial Paper) market is based in London and is not \\nregulated.\\nt The French TCN ( Titres de Créances Négociables) on which French but also other \\nEuropean corporates issue. This market is regulated and under the supervision of \\nFrench market authorities, and offers better secured and more flexible transactions \\n(spot and overnight delivery).\\nShort-Term European Paper (STEP) is a label adopted in 2006 that has homogenised \\nthe documentation for the issue of short-term paper.\\nCommercial paper enables companies to borrow directly from investors or other compa-\\nnies without going through the banking system and at rates very close to those of the \\nmoney market.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 387}, page_content='FINANCIAL SECURITIES372\\nSECTION 2\\nc21.indd 12:32:44:PM  09/05/2014 Page 372Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\nObtaining at least a short-term credit rating for a commercial paper issue is optional \\nbut implicitly recommended, since companies are required to indicate whether they have \\ncalled on a specialised rating agency and, if so, must disclose the rating given. Moreover, \\nany issuer can ask a bank for a commitment to provide financing should the market situ-\\nation make it impossible to renew the note. These backup lines came into their own at \\nthe end of 2008 when the commercial paper market virtually closed for several weeks \\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Companies have to have such lines if they \\nwant their commercial paper issues to get an investment grade rating. Certain credit rating \\nagencies, for example, will only keep their short-term rating of outstanding commercial \\npaper at A1+ if 70% of the paper is covered by a backup line.\\nIn addition to lower issue costs, commercial paper gives the company some auton-\\nomy vis-à-vis its bankers. It is very flexible in terms of maturity and rates, but less so in \\nterms of issue amounts.\\nRegardless of their country of origin, companies can issue American commercial \\npaper. Such issues are governed by Regulation 144A defining the terms and conditions of \\nsecurities issues by foreign companies in the US (see Chapter 26).\\n–\\n20\\n1989199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\nOutstanding commercial paper in France and the Eurozone (in €bn)\\nFrance\\nEurozone\\n2/ LONG -TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES\\nObviously the key type of long-term marketable debt securities are bonds which we \\ndescribed in the previous chapter.\\nWe should also mention private placements. They usually take the form of bonds but are \\na very specific product halfway between a loan product and a standard bond issue. Private \\nplacements are issued to a limited number of institutional investors (“qualified investors”).\\nThere is a market for such products in the US where there is a specific regulation for \\nsuch issues, but also in Germany (Schuldschein), in Belgium (mostly to individual inves-\\ntors) as well as for a few years in France. Regulations are evolving in Europe as tradition-\\nally it is not too friendly to this type of instrument.\\nSource: Banque de France'),\n",

The transaction usually \\nconsists in an immediate financing in dollars or euros with a fixed rate. As there is no \\nliquidity constraint, the issues (or each tranche within an issue) can be of reduced size \\n(compared to a standard bond issue). These financings generally have a long maturity \\n(seven to 15 years with the bulk of the issue with a six- to seven-year maturity).\\nThey are appealing for groups that are willing to diversify their financing sources \\nand have access to long-term financing without the need for a rating. The documentation \\nusually includes some stringent covenants and investors in such products may show much \\nless flexibility than banks when it comes to renegotiation.\\nThe increasing constraints on bank solvency have led to reduced loan offerings, in \\nparticular outside of the domestic market. Financings outside the banking circuit have \\ntherefore developed (shadow banking), and the increasing success of private placements \\nis just an illustration thereof.\\nSection 21.2\\nBANK DEBT PRODUCTS\\nBanks have developed a number of credit products that, contrary to market financing, are \\ntailored to meet the specific needs of their clients.\\nBusiness loans (i.e. loans not linked to a specific asset) have two key characteristics: \\nthey are based on interest rates and take into account the overall risk to the company.\\nThe credit line will either be negotiated with a single bank, in which case the term \\nbilateral loan is used, or with a number of banks (usually for larger amounts) and the firm \\nwill then put in place a club deal or a syndicated loan.\\nFor companies, these loans are often a backup mechanism to meet any kind of cash \\npayment.\\nBusiness loans are based on interest rates – in other words, cost, and the cheapest \\nloan on offer usually wins the company’s business. They rarely come with ancillary ser-\\nvices such as debt recovery, and are determined according to the maturity schedule and \\nmargin on the market rate.\\nThese loans take into account corporate risk. The bank lending the funds agrees to \\ntake on the company’s overall risk as reflected in its financial health. A profitable company \\nwill always obtain financing as long as it adopts a sufficiently prudent capital structure. In \\nfact, the financial loan is guaranteed by the corporate manager’s explicit compliance with \\na certain number of criteria, such as ratios, etc.\\n1/ TYPES OF BUSINESS LOANS\\nOverdrafts on current accounts are the corporate treasurer’s means of adjusting to tem-\\nporary cash shortages but, given their high interest charges, they should not be used too \\nfrequently or for too long. Small enterprises can only obtain overdrafts against collateral, \\nmaking the overdraft more of a secured loan.\\nCommercial loans are short-term loans that are easy to set up and therefore very \\npopular.'),\n",

The interest \\nrate is the bank’s refinancing rate plus a margin negotiated between the two parties. It gen-\\nerally ranges from 0.10% to 1.50% per year depending on the borrower’s creditworthiness \\nsince there are no other guarantees.\\nCommercial loans can be made in foreign currencies either because the company \\nneeds foreign currencies or because the lending rates are more attractive.\\nAlternatively, the firm can put in place a revolving credit facility (RCF) which is a \\nconfirmed short-term or mid-term credit line. When the line is put in place, the firm will \\nnot have debt on its balance sheet, but it will have the capacity to draw on the credit line \\nwhen it needs it. On the undrawn amount, the corporate will only pay an engagement fee \\n(between 0.1% and 1% of the amount depending on the credit quality of the firm and the \\nmaturity of the line).\\nIf the firm has to finance a specific investment, it will put in place a term loan that \\nwill be less flexible than the RCF. Usually the borrower has the capacity to reimburse by \\nanticipation but will not be allowed to re-borrow any of the repaid amounts.\\nA bridge loan is put in place to finance an investment quickly. A bridge loan can be \\nreimbursed in the short term after a long-term financing has been put in place (long-term \\nloan, equity issue, disposal of a subsidiary, etc.). This type of loan is costly as it presents \\na significant risk for the lender. Its development is highly dependent on the activity of the \\nmergers and acquisitions market.\\nSyndicated loans are typically set up for facilities exceeding €50m which a single \\nbank does not want to take on alone. The lead bank (or banks depending on the amounts \\ninvolved), known as the mandated lead arranger, will arrange the line and commit to \\nundertake the full amount of the credit. It will then syndicate part of the loan to some five \\nto 20 banks which will each lend part of the amount. The mandated lead arranger will \\nreceive an arrangement and underwriting fee and the other banks a lower participation \\nfee. If the line remains undrawn, banks will receive a fee for the commitment to make the \\nfunds available if the firm needs them (commitment fee).\\nFirm underwriting by one firm will allow the company to maintain maximum confi-\\ndentiality with regard to the transaction which could be crucial, for example in the case \\nof the acquisition of a listed company. This can be achieved by having only one arranging \\nbank that will bear the whole credit risk until the transaction become public (it can then \\nsyndicate the loan).\\n0\\n500\\n1,000\\n1,500\\n2,000\\n2,500\\n3,000\\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\\nAmericas Asia Pacific & Other Europe, Middle East & Africa\\nSyndicated loans worldwide (in US$bn)\\nSource: Dealogic'),\n",

Large groups use such master agreements as multi-currency and multi-\\ncompany backup lines and umbrella lines, and secure financing from their usual banks \\naccording to market conditions. Smaller companies sometimes obtain similar financing \\nfrom their banks. Engagement commissions are usually paid on these credit lines.\\nMaster agreements take into account the borrower’s organisation chart by organis-\\ning and regulating its subsidiaries’ access to the credit lines. At the local level, the busi-\\nness relationship between the company’s representatives and the bank’s branches may be \\nbased on the credit conditions set up at group level. Subsidiaries in other countries can \\ndraw on the same lines at the same conditions. Centralising credit facilities in this manner \\noffers a number of advantages by:\\ntpooling cash between subsidiaries in different countries to minimise cash balance \\ndifferentials;\\nt harmonising the financing costs of subsidiaries or divisions;\\nt centralising administrative and negotiating costs to achieve real economies of \\nstructure.\\nMaster agreements are based on a network of underlying guarantees between the subsid-\\niaries party to the agreement and the parent company. In particular, the parent company \\nmust provide a letter of credit for each subsidiary.\\n2/ FEATURES OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTATION\\nThe loan documentation sets out:\\ntthe amount, maturity and purpose of the loan (i.e. the use of funds);\\nt the way the amount will be cashed in by the firm (one single payment, upon request \\nby the firm, etc.);\\nt the interest rate, fixed or floating, periodicity of interest payments, rules for the com-\\nputation of interest, fees to be paid;\\nt the reimbursement or amortisation features;\\nt the potential early repayment options;\\nt the potential guarantees, pledges;\\nt the covenants.\\nBanks include a certain number of covenants in the loan agreements, chiefly regarding \\naccounting ratios, financial decisions and share ownership. These covenants fall into four \\nmain categories:\\ntPositive or affirmative covenants  are agreements to comply with certain \\ncapital structure or earnings ratios, to adopt a given legal structure or even to \\nrestructure.'),\n",

The execution of such clauses (as well as “market \\ndisruption” clauses) is very complex from a legal point of view but also from a commer-\\ncial point of view.\\nStandardised legal documentation for syndicated loans has developed in Europe, led \\nby the Loan Market Association (LMA) in London.\\nThere is clear cyclicality on the loan market. After a period of high liquidity \\n(2004-2007) marked by very favourable borrowing terms (both in terms of legal \\ndocumentation and spreads), banks drastically tightened the terms and conditions of their \\nloans after 2008 due to the weakening of their loan portfolios and the reduced market \\nliquidity. Since 2010, the market has returned to normal.\\nSection 21.3\\nFINANCING LINKED TO AN ASSET OF THE FIRM\\n1/ DISCOUNTING\\nThere are several short-term financing techniques that bridge the cash-flow gap between \\ninvoicing and collection and are backed by the corresponding trade receivable. They are \\nthe counterpart to trade credit (inter-company credit), which is widely used in some coun-\\ntries (Continental Europe).\\nDiscounting is a financing transaction whereby a company remits an unexpired com-\\nmercial bill of exchange to the bank in return for an advance of the amount of the bill, \\nless interest and fees.\\nThe discounting bank becomes the owner of the bill and, ordinarily, is repaid when \\nit presents the bill to its customer’s customer for payment. If, at maturity, the bill remains \\nunpaid, the bank turns to the company, which assumes the bankruptcy risk of its customer \\n(such discounting is called discounting with recourse).\\nIn principle, a company uses discounting to obtain financing based on the credit it \\nextends to its own customers, which may be better known to the banking system than the \\ncompany is. In this way, the company may be able to obtain better financing rates.\\nIn discounting, the bank does not finance the company itself, but only certain receiv-\\nables in its portfolio, i.e. the bills of exchange. For the bank, the risk is bound by a double \\nguarantee: the credit quality of its customer backed by that of the issuer of the bill of \\nexchange.\\nUnder most accounting principles (including IFRS and US GAAP), discounted bills \\nare reintegrated into accounts receivable and the bank advances are reported as debt.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 392}, page_content='Chapter 21 OTHER DEBT PRODUCTS 377\\nSECTION 2\\nc21.indd 12:32:44:PM  09/05/2014 Page 377Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\nFor this reason, banks now also offer non-recourse discounting, which is a straight \\nsale of customer receivables, under which the bank has no recourse to its customer if \\nthe bill remains unpaid at maturity. This technique allows the company to remove the \\nreceivables from its balance sheet and from its off-balance-sheet commitments and \\ncontingencies.\\n2/ FACTORING\\nFactoring is a credit transaction whereby a company holding an outstanding trade bill \\ntransfers it to its bank or a specialised financial institution in exchange for the payment \\nof the bill, less interest and commissions. Factoring companies or factors specialise in \\nbuying a given portion of a company’s trade receivables at a discount to the face value. \\nThe factoring company then collects the invoice payment directly from the debtors.\\nFactoring actually may include one or several of the following services to the firm:\\nt a financing with an attractive interest rate;\\nt the externalisation of receivables recovery;\\nt an insurance against unpaid bills;\\nt an off-balance-sheet financing.\\nFactoring is like discounting with additional services!\\nBanks increasingly offer non-recourse discounting services, which consist of an out-\\nright purchase of the trade receivables without recourse in the event of default. This tech-\\nnique removes contingent liabilities from the bank’s on- and off-balance-sheet accounts.\\n3/ LEASES\\nIn a lease contract the firm (lessee) commits itself to making fixed payments (usually \\nmonthly or semi-annually) to the owner of the asset (lessor) for the right to use the asset. \\nThese payments are either fully or partially tax-deductible, depending on how the lease \\nis categorised for accounting purposes. The lessor is either the asset’s manufacturer or an \\nindependent leasing company.\\nIf the firm fails to make fixed payments it normally results in the loss of the asset \\nand even bankruptcy, although the claim of the lessor is normally subordinated to other \\nlenders.\\nThe lease contract may take a number of different forms, but is normally categorised \\nas either an operating or a financial lease.\\nFor operating leases, the term of the lease contract is shorter than the economic life \\nof the asset. Consequently, the present value of lease payments is normally lower than the \\nmarket value of the asset. At the end of the contract the asset reverts back to the lessor, \\nwho can either offer to sell it to the lessee or lease it again to somebody else. In an operat-\\ning lease, the lessee generally has the right to cancel the lease and return the asset to the \\nlessor. Thus, the lessee bears little or no risk if the asset becomes obsolete.\\nA financial (or capital) lease normally lasts for the entire economic life of the asset. \\nThe present value of fixed payments tends to cover the market value of the asset. At the \\nend of the contract, the lease can be renewed at a reduced rate or the lessee can buy the \\nasset at a favourable price. This contract cannot be cancelled by the lessee.'),\n",

In the latter case, the shorter of use-\\nful life and lease term should be used.\\nt Lessees should expense operating lease payments.\\nThere are different reasons a firm can prefer leasing.\\n1. The firm may not have the borrowing capacity to purchase an asset.\\n2. Operating leases provide a source of off-balance-sheet financing for heavily lever-\\naged firms. However, this opportunity does not reduce the firm’s financial risk. \\nLenders are, in fact, careful in considering the cash-flow effects of lease payments.\\n3. The firm may want to avoid bond covenants.\\n4/ SALE AND LEASE BACK\\nSale and lease back is a procedure by which a company that owns a factory, an office \\nblock, a machine, etc., sells it to a leasing company or a real estate company, which \\nimmediately places it at the company’s disposal through an ordinary rental agreement or \\nan equipment or real estate leasing agreement, depending on the nature of the asset sold.\\nIn consolidated financial statements, assets rented through leasing appear on the asset \\nside of the balance sheet while the corresponding financing appears on the liabilities side. \\nOn the other hand, if the sale makes it possible to transfer the risk from the owner to the \\nbuyer, the assets and the debt no longer appear on the balance sheet1.\\nThere are several aims behind sale and lease back operations. Such operations that \\nresult in the putting in place of a financial lease often aim at extending the duration of debt \\nand possibly a reduction in the cost of debt. When the sale is followed by an operating \\nlease agreement, the aim is generally to reduce debt on the balance sheet and to free up \\ncash in order to finance new developments.\\nSale and lease back operations generally involve real estate assets: the operational \\nreal estate assets or the headquarters of industrial or services companies are sold and \\nleased back by the company. In this way, most of the major retailers (Carrefour, Tesco), \\nhotel chains (Marriott, Accor), restaurant chains (Taco Mac, Buffalo Grill) or clinic oper-\\nators (Spire Healthcare, Générale de Santé) have sold part of their real estate.\\nCompanies carrying out a sale and lease back with the aim of restructuring their bal-\\nance sheets or extending the maturity of their debts should first analyse the tax impact of \\nthe operation (stamp duty, capital gains tax), the accounting impact (any capital losses or \\n1 See page 104 \\nfor accounting \\nand financial \\ntreatment.'),\n",

The banks \\ngranting the buyer’s credit undertake to provide the borrower with the funds needed to \\npay the supplier directly according to the terms specified by the contract.\\nThe borrower, in turn, gives the bank an irrevocable mandate to pay the funds only \\nto the supplier. The agreement stipulates the interest rates, duration and repayment \\nconditions of the loan, and any bank fees or penalties that may arise if the borrower fails \\nto meet its obligations.\\nThe credit agreement also specifies that the transaction is purely financial, since the \\nborrower must repay the funds notwithstanding any disputes that may arise in the course \\nof its business with the exporter. The advantages to the supplier are:\\ntinsurance against payment default;\\nt the cost of the credit is not deducted from the contract while the risk level remains  \\nacceptable to the bank;\\nt the portion of the contract that must be paid upon maturity is not on the balance sheet.\\nMoreover, in most cases the first payments can be made before completion of the contract. \\nThere is thus less need to resort to cash or pre-financing loans. And lastly, if the sale is \\ndenominated in a foreign currency there is no need to worry about hedging the foreign \\nexchange risk while the borrower makes his repayments.\\nCertain types of buyer’s credit can also be used to finance major projects and thus \\nresemble project financing, which we will discuss shortly.\\n6/ SECURITISATION\\nSecuritisation was initially used by credit institutions looking to refinance part of their \\nassets; in other words, to convert customer loans into negotiable securities.\\nSecuritisation works as follows: a bank first selects mortgages or consumer loans, or \\nunsecured loans such as credit card receivables, based on the quality of the collateral they \\noffer or their level of risk. To reduce risk, the loans are then grouped into an SPV (special \\npurpose vehicle) so as to pool risks and take advantage of the law of large numbers. The \\nSPV buys the loans and finances itself by issuing securities to outside investors: equity, \\nmezzanine debt, subordinated debt, senior debt, commercial paper, etc., so as to offer dif-\\nferent risk–return profiles to investors. Usually the vehicle is kept alive and “refilled” pro-\\ngressively by banks with new loans when old loans mature. A new entity, such as a debt \\nsecuritisation fund, receives the flow of interest and principal payments emanating from \\nthe loans it bought from the banks (or non-bank companies). The fund uses the proceeds \\nto cover its obligations on the securities it has issued.'),\n",

Alternatively, the SPV can take \\nout an insurance policy with an insurance company. The SPV might also obtain a short-\\nterm line of credit to ensure the payment of interest in the event of a temporary interrup-\\ntion in the flow of interest and principal payments.\\nMost of the time, the securitisation vehicle subcontracts administration of the fund \\nand recovery to one service provider and cash management to another. More complicated \\nstructures, often based on swaps (see Chapter 49), can also be used when the SPV does \\nnot need to reproduce the exact cash flows of the original loans. Instead, cash flows can \\nbe reorganised to satisfy the requirements of the various investors involved: no income \\nstream, steady income stream, increasing income stream, etc.\\nWith the help of securitisation specialists, some industrial companies regularly se-\\ncuritise accounts receivable, inventories, buildings or other assets. In short, the whole bal-\\nance sheet can be made liquid. Once isolated, certain assets are of higher quality than the \\nbalance sheet as a whole, thus allowing the company to finance them at preferential rates. \\nThat said, the cost of these arrangements is higher than that of straight debt, especially for \\na high-quality borrower with an attractive cost of debt.\\nFor example, ArcelorMittal securitises its account receivables and Avis its rental \\nfleet, while Glencore does the same thing with its lead, nickel, zinc, copper and alu-\\nminium inventories.\\nSecuritisation\\nEquity\\nEquity\\nMezzanine debt\\nSubordinated debt\\nSenior debt\\nSPV\\nAssets\\nsecuritised\\nEquityDebt\\nDebt\\nOther assets\\nOther assets\\nAssets to\\nbe securitised\\nCompany balance sheet before securitisation\\nCash used to pay down debt\\nInvestors\\nCompany balance sheet after securitisation\\nSold\\nSource: www.europeansecuritisation.com'),\n",

Sometimes \\nlenders take the global risk of the group in the form of subordinated debts (see Chapter 24). \\nIn other cases they may only be taking the risk of one project of the group which, most of \\nthe time, is isolated into a separate entity.\\n(a)Principle and techniques\\nProject financing is used to raise funds for large-scale projects with costs running into the \\nhundreds of millions of euros, such as oil extraction, mining, oil refineries, the purchase \\nof methane tankers, the construction of power plants or works of art.\\nLenders base their decision to extend such financing on an assessment of the project \\nitself rather than the borrower, and on the projected cash flows generated by the project \\nthat will repay the credit. They rely on the project’s assets as collateral for the debt.\\nThis type of financing was first used in the early 1930s by American banks to extend \\nfinancing to oil prospectors who could not offer the guarantees required for standard \\nloans. The banks drew up loan contracts in which a fraction of the oil still in the ground \\nwas given as collateral and part of the future sales were set aside to repay the loan.\\nWith this financial innovation, bankers moved beyond their traditional sphere of \\nfinancing to become more involved, albeit with a number of precautions, in the actual risk \\narising from the project.\\nBut it is all too easy to become intoxicated by the sophistication and magnitude of \\nsuch financial structures and their potential returns. Remember that the bank is taking on \\nfar more risk than with a conventional loan, and could well find itself at the head of a fleet '),\n",

Lastly, \\nthe parent company cannot completely wash its hands of the financial risk inherent in the \\nproject, and banks will try to get the parent company’s financial guarantee, just in case.\\nWhen considering project financing, it is essential to look closely at the professional \\nexpertise and reputation of the contractor. The project’s returns, and thus its ability to \\nrepay the loan, often depend on the contractor’s ability to control a frequently long and \\ncomplex construction process in which cost overruns and missed deadlines are far from \\nrare. Project financing is not just a matter of applying a standard technique. Each indi-\\nvidual project must be analysed in detail to determine the optimal financing structure so \\nthat the project can be completed under the best possible financial conditions.\\nThe financiers, the future manager of the project and the contractor(s) are grouped in \\na pool taking the form of a company set up specifically for the project. This company is \\nthe vehicle for the bank financing.\\nClearly, project financing cannot be applied to new technologies which have uncertain\\noperating cash flows, since the loan repayment depends on these cash flows. Similarly, \\nthe operator must have acknowledged expertise in operating the project, and the project’s \\npolitical environment must be stable to ensure that operations proceed smoothly. Only \\nthus can investors and banks be assured that the loan will be repaid as planned.\\nIn addition to investors and banks, two other players can take on an important role in \\nproject finance:\\ntinternational financial organisations such as the World Bank and regional devel-\\nopment banks like the EBRD,2 especially if the project is located in a developing \\ncountry. These institutions may lend funds directly or guarantee the loans extended \\nby the other banks;\\nt export facilitating organisations like Coface in France or EBRD in the UK or SACE \\nin Italy, which underwrite both the financial and the commercial risks arising on the \\nproject.\\n(b) Risks and how they are hedged\\nThe risks on large projects arise during three quite distinct stages:\\nt when the project is being set up;\\nt during construction;\\nt during operations.\\nContrary to appearances, risks arise as soon as the project is in the planning stage. Analys-\\ning a major project can take up to several years and requires considerable expertise and \\nnumerous technical and financial feasibility studies. All this can be quite costly. At this \\nstage, no one is sure that the project will actually materialise. Moreover, when there is \\na call for tenders, the potential investors are not even sure that their bid will be retained.\\nBut, of course, the greatest risk occurs during construction, since any loss can only \\nbe recouped once the facilities are up and running!\\nSome of the main risks incurred during the construction phase are:\\nt Cost overruns or delays. These are par for the course on large projects that are com-\\nplex and lengthy. Such risks can be covered by specific insurance that can make up \\nfor the lack of income subject to the payment of additional premiums. Any claims \\nbenefits are paid directly to the lenders of the funds, or to both borrowers and lend-\\ners. Another method is for the contractor to undertake to cover all or part of any cost \\n2 European \\nBank for Recon-\\nstruction and \\nDevelopment'),\n",

In exchange, the \\ncontractor may be paid a premium for early completion.\\nt Non-completion of work, which is covered by performance bonds and contract \\nguarantees, which unconditionally guarantee that the industrial unit will be built on \\nschedule and with the required output capacity and production quality.\\nt “Economic upheavals” imposed by the government (e.g. car factories in Indonesia, \\ndams in Nigeria, with initial strong support by local governments which was with-\\ndrawn later on because of cash shortages or a change of government) and arbitrary \\nacts of government, such as changes in regulations.\\nt Natural catastrophes that are not normally covered by conventional insurance policies.\\nAs a result, the financing is released according to expert assessments of the progress made \\non the project.\\nRisk exposure culminates between the end of construction and the start of operations. \\nAt this point, all funds have been released but the activity that will generate the flows \\nto repay them has not yet begun and its future is still uncertain. Moreover, a new risk \\nemerges when the installations are delivered to the client, since they must be shown to \\ncomply with the contract and the client’s specifications. Because of the risk that the client \\nmay refuse to accept the installations, the contract usually provides for an independent \\narbitrator, generally a specialised international firm, to verify that the work delivered is in \\nconformity with the contract.\\nOnce the plant has come on stream, anticipated returns may be affected by:\\nt Operating risks per se: faulty design of the facilities, rising operating or procure-\\nment costs. When this occurs, the profit and loss account diverges from the business \\nplan presented to creditors to convince them to extend financing. Lenders can hedge \\nagainst this risk by requiring long-term sales contracts, such as:\\n○ take or pay: these contracts link the owner of the facilities (typically for the \\nextraction and/or transformation of energy products) and the future users whose \\nneed for it is more or less urgent. The users agree to pay a certain amount that will \\ncover both interest and principal payments, irrespective of whether the product is \\ndelivered and of any cases of force majeure;\\n○ take and pay: this clause is far less restrictive than take or pay, since clients sim-\\nply agree to take delivery of the products or to use the installations if they have \\nbeen delivered and are in perfect operating condition.\\nt Market risks. These risks may arise when the market proves smaller than expected, \\nthe product becomes obsolete or the conditions in which it is marketed change. They \\ncan be contained, although never completely eliminated, by careful study of the sales \\ncontracts, in particular the revision and cancellation clauses which are the linchpin of \\nproject financing, as well as detailed market research.\\nt Foreign exchange risks are usually eliminated by denominating the loan in the same \\ncurrency as the flows arising on the project or through swap contracts (see above).\\nt Abandonment risk arises when the interests of the industrial manager and the \\nbankers diverge. For example, the former may want to bail out as soon as the return \\non capital employed appears insufficient, while the latter will only reach this con-\\nclusion when cash flow turns negative. Here again, the project financing contract \\nmust lay down clear rules on how decisions affecting the future of the project are \\nto be taken.\\nt Political risks, for which no guarantees exist but which can be partly underwritten by \\nstate agencies.'),\n",

It is in compensation for \\nthese two disadvantages that shareholders have a say in managing the company via the \\nvoting rights attached to their shares.\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to present the key parameters used in analysing stocks \\nand show how the stock market operates. For a discussion of stock as a claim option on \\noperating assets, refer to Chapter 34, and to find out more about stock as a claim on assets \\nand commitments, see Chapter 31 on company valuation.\\nSection 22.1\\nBASIC CONCEPTS\\nThis section presents the basic concepts for analysing the value of stocks, whether or not \\nthey are listed. Remember that past or future financial transactions could artificially skew \\nthe market value of a stock with no change in total equity value. When this happens, tech-\\nnical adjustments are necessary, as explained in Section 22.5 of this chapter. We will then \\nassume that they have been done.\\n1/ VOTING RIGHTS\\nShares are normally issued with one voting right each. For our purposes, this is more of \\na compensation for the risk assumed by the shareholder than a basic characteristic of \\nstock.\\nA company can issue shares with either limited or no voting rights. These are known \\nunder different names, such as preference shares, savings shares or simply non-voting \\nshares.\\nAt the other extreme, companies in some countries, such as the United States \\nand Sweden, issue several types of shares (“A” shares, “B” shares, etc.) having differ-\\nent numbers of voting rights. Some shareholders use this to strengthen their hold on a \\ncompany, as we will see in Chapter 41.'),\n",

In this case, in addition to standard EPS, analysts \\n calculate fully diluted EPS. We will show how they do this in Section 22.4.\\n3/ DIVIDEND  PER  SHARE  (DPS)\\nDividends are generally paid out from the net earnings for a given year but can be paid out \\nof earnings that have been retained from previous years.

While book value may appear to be directly comparable to equity value, \\nit is determined on an entirely different basis – it is the result of strategies undertaken up \\nto the date of the analysis and corresponds to the amount invested by the shareholders in \\nthe company (i.e. new shares issued and retained earnings).\\nBook value may or may not be restated. This is generally done only for financial \\ninstitutions and holding companies.\\n7/ COST  OF EQUITY  (EXPECTED  RATE  OF  RETURN )\\nAccording to the CAPM (see Chapter 19), the cost of equity is equal to the risk-free rate \\nplus a risk premium that reflects the stock’s market (or systematic) risk.\\nk rr rEf f=+ × (− )β M\\n8/ SHAREHOLDER  RETURN  (HISTORICAL  RATE  OF RETURN )\\nIn a given year, shareholders receive a return in the form of dividends (dividend yield) and \\nthe increase in price or market value (capital gain):\\n DivPP\\nPP\\n10\\n00\\n1− +\\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) is calculated in the same way, but over a longer period.

It would not make much sense to analyse the \\nprice of a stock that is traded only once a week, for example.\\nA share price is relevant only if the stock is sufﬁciently liquid.\\nA share’s liquidity is measured mainly in terms of free float, trade volumes and analyst \\ncoverage (number of analysts following the stock, quality and frequency of brokers’ notes).\\n(a) Free ﬂoat\\nThe free float is the proportion of shares available to purely financial investors, to buy \\nwhen the price looks low and sell when it looks high.

Here again, absolute value \\nis the measure of liquidity, as a major institutional investor will first try to determine how \\nlong it will take to buy (or sell) the amount it has targeted. But volumes must also be \\nexpressed in terms of percentage of the total number of shares and even as a percentage \\nof free float.\\n10/  MARKET CAPITALISATION\\nMarket capitalisation is the market value of company equity. It is obtained by multiply-\\ning the total number of shares outstanding by the share price. However, rarely can the \\nmajority of the shares be bought at this price at the same time, for example, in an attempt \\nto take control and appoint new management. Most often, a premium must be paid (see \\nChapters 31 and 44).\\nAll too often, only the shares in free float are counted in determining market capitali-\\nsation. All shares must be included, as market cap is the market value of company equity \\nand not of the free float.\\nOn 2 May 2014, Indesit had a market cap of €1170m.\\nSection 22.2\\nMULTIPLES\\nIn order to understand the level of stock prices, investors must make some comparisons \\nwith comparable investments (similar stocks). By doing so, they can arbitrage between \\nstocks taking into account their belief about the companies’ qualities and the level of \\ntheir prices. To achieve this objective, investors normally relate the stock price to a \\nfinancial item.\\nThere are two basic categories of multiples:\\nt those which allow for a direct estimate of the market capitalisation. In this section, \\nwe will refer specifically to the price to earnings ratio (P/E);\\nt those which don’t consider the capital structure of the company. These multiples \\nallow for the estimate of the value of the entire firm (firm or enterprise value) or, \\nsimilarly, the market value of the capital employed. The EBIT multiple will be pre-\\nsented in this section. Since capital employed is financed by equity and net debt, '),\n",

With a pinch of salt, the \\ninvestor can then decide to apply the same multiple to the EBIT of the company he is \\nconsidering.\\nInvestors name this ratio the EBIT multiple:\\nEBIT multiple Enterprise value\\nOperating profit=\\nEnterprise value is normally estimated by summing the market value of equity and the \\nbook value of net debt, assuming that the difference between the book value of debt and \\nthe corresponding market value is rarely enormous.\\nWhere the comparison is made using companies with different fiscal positions \\n(because they belong to different countries, for example), it is more appropriate to con-\\nsider an operating profit net of taxes (net operating profit after tax or NOPAT). This result \\ncan be easily obtained by multiplying the operating profit by (1 – the corporate tax rate \\nof the specific country).\\nA company whose value is 100 with an operating profit is 12.5 will be traded for \\n8× its operating profit. If the operating profit remains unchanged, and disregarding the \\nterminal value, these figures imply that investors must wait eight years before they can \\nrecover their investment. Conversely, if the operating profit increases, they will not have \\nto wait so long. \\nThe following interpretation is consequently allowed: the EBIT multiple corresponds \\nto the purchase price of €1 of the operating profit.\\nIn practice, when applying the multiple, financial analysts prefer using the operating \\nprofit of the current period or of the next period.\\n(b) The multiple drivers\\nAlthough the EBIT multiple is a ratio that summarises a lot of information, its value is \\nbasically determined by three factors: the growth rate of the operating profit, the risk of \\ncapital employed and the level of interest rates.\\n 1. The growth rate of the operating profit. There is a certain degree of correlation \\nbetween the multiple and the expected growth of the operating profit. This is no \\nsurprise. Investors will be more willing to pay a higher price if the operating profit \\nthe enterprise value must then be allocated between creditors (first) and shareholders. \\nThe following formula shows how to derive the value of equity from the enterprise \\nvalue:'),\n",

The level of interest rates . There is a strong inverse correlation between the level \\nof interest rates and the EBIT multiple. This link is rather intuitive: our reader is, in \\nfact, perfectly aware that high interest rates increase the returns expected by inves-\\ntors (think, for example, about the CAPM equation!), thus reducing the value of \\nany asset.\\nAll other things held equal, the higher the level of interest rates, the lower the operating \\nproﬁt multiple; the lower the interest rates, the higher the multiple.\\nGenerally speaking, we can say that the level of the multiple can be frequently explained \\n– at a specific moment – by the current level of interest rates in the economy.\\nThe EBIT multiple allows us to assess the company valuation compared to the overall \\nmarket.\\n2/ PRICE  TO EARNINGS  (P/E)\\n(a) The principle\\nEven if the EBIT multiple has become very popular in the investor and analyst com-\\nmunity, a ratio simpler to compute has been used for a while to determine share prices. \\nThe P/E (Price/earnings ratio) which when multiplied by the earnings per share (EPS) \\nprovides an estimate for the value of the share. \\nP/E is equal to:\\nP/E Price per share\\nEPS=\\nAnother way to put this is to consider the aggregate values:\\nP/E Market capitalisation\\nNet income=\\nEPS reflects theoretical value creation over a period of one year. Unlike a dividend, \\nEPS is not a revenue stream.\\nAs an illustration, the following table shows the P/E ratios of the main markets since \\n1990. We can see the impact of the 2000 bubble on P/Es for TMT groups but also the \\nimpact of the 2009/2010 crisis with a fall due to the reversal of growth prospects, fol-\\nlowed by a jump in 2010 due to poor earnings.\\nWhile there is no obligation to do so, P/E is based on estimated earnings for the cur-\\nrent year. However, forward earnings are also considered; for example, N +1 expresses \\nthe current market value of the stock vs. estimated earnings for the following year. For \\nfast-growing companies or companies that are currently losing money, P/EN+1 or P/E N+2 \\nare sometimes used, either to give a more representative figure (and thus avoid scaring the \\ninvestor!) or because, in the case of loss-making companies, it is impossible to calculate \\nP/E for year N.\\nThe widespread use of P/E (which is implicitly assumed to be constant over time) to \\ndetermine equity value has given rise to the myth of EPS as a financial criterion to assess \\na company’s financial strategy. Such a decision might or might not be taken on the basis '),\n",

This is why P/E is so important, but it also has \\nits limits, as we will demonstrate in Chapters 26, 27 and in Section IV .\\nP/E is conceptually similar to the EBIT multiple, and even moreso to the NOPAT \\nmultiple. The latter is a division of enterprise value by after-tax operating profit, while P/E \\nis a division of market value by net profit.\\nHence, many of the things we have said about the EBIT multiple also apply to P/E:\\nt Another way of understanding P/E is to note that it expresses market value on the \\nbasis of the number of years of earnings that are being bought. Thus, an equity value \\nof 100 and earnings of 12.5 means the P/E is 8. This means that if EPS remains \\nconstant, the investor will have to wait eight years to recover his investment, while \\nignoring the residual value of the investment after eight years, omitting the discount \\nand assuming that he receives all of the EPS. If the EPS rises (falls), the investor will \\nhave to wait less (more) than eight years.\\nt In an efficient market, the greater the EPS growth, the higher the P/E, and vice versa.\\nt P/E is inversely proportional to interest rates: all other factors being equal, the higher \\nthe interest rates, the lower the P/Es and vice versa, again assuming efficient markets.\\nt The greater the perceived risk, the lower the P/E, and vice versa.\\nP/E is used in the same way as the EBIT multiple. To value a company, it is useful to set it \\nalongside other companies that are as comparable as possible in terms of activity, growth \\nprospects and risk, and then apply their P/E to it.\\nP/E reflects a risk that the EBIT multiple does not – financial structure – which comes \\non top of the risk presented by the operating assets.\\nP/E can only be used for valuation purposes if the comparable companies have the same \\nEPS growth and the same risks on both the operating and ﬁnancial levels.\\nHISTORICAL P/E RATIOS - PAN-EUROPEAN SECTORS (AS OF JANUARY 1ST)\\nYear\\nAutomotive\\nBiotechnologies\\nChemistry\\nDefence\\nFinancial\\nInstitutions\\nFood\\nOil & Gas\\nReal Estate\\nTelecom\\nUtilities\\n1990 6.7 21.7 8.3 6.9 16.1 14.1 11.2 24.8 12.8 11.1\\n1995 13.4 30.4 13.5 14.3 14.1 12.9 17.3 20.4 12.7 13.4\\n2000 13.2 180.5 18.4 19.0 19.3 17.1 38.5 21.2 51.7 17.3\\n2005 10.1 66.3 15.7 15.9 13.5 15.1 13.1 22.8 15.4 14.6\\n2006 10.7 321.8 14.5 15.9 14.7 17.7 12.3 24.4 16.1 17.2\\n2007 14.0 40.7 13.4 15.0 13.9 17.3 10.4 20.4 15.2 20.7\\n2008 12.7 68.6 15.5 15.4 9.5 19.5 11.9 6.7 19.0 18.5\\n2009 6.5 36.7 9.9 10.5 5.8 8.4 6.4 9.8 9.8 10.4\\n2010 52.5 37.4 32.1 11.7 16.0 16.0 19.3 43.8 12.9 12.4\\n2011 17.5 43.3 19.3 10.8 11.8 16.0 15.8 19.5 7.5 10.8\\n2012 3.9 44.1 12.0 11.7 8.4 16.0 8.9 8.1 11.8 11.4\\n2013 4.9 37.2 17.6 9.2 13.0 16.7 9.3 21.0 9.3 11.3\\n2014 9.3 42.3 18.6 14.2 12.9 18.9 10.0 16.3 18.8 15.1\\nSource: Datastream'),\n",

This ratio is often used to derive the value of shops or \\nvery small companies.\\nUsing such multiples implies that the compared firms have the same type of profit-\\nability. It implies somehow a normative return over sales for firms in a certain sector.\\nWe believe that sales multiples should not be used for mid-size or large companies as \\nthey completely disregard profitability. They have often been used in the past, in times of \\nbull markets, to value Internet or biotech companies, for example, as such companies did \\nnot show a positive EBIT!\\nThe same type of criticism can be levelled against multiples of numbers of subscrib-\\ners, numbers of clicks… or other multiples of volume of activity. These multiples not only \\nassume a comparable return over sales but also the same revenue per unit.\\n(b) EBITDA multiple\\nIn some sectors such as the telecoms sector, depreciation can be a very high proportion of \\ncosts (18% of V odafone’s costs), and as depreciation periods and methods can be largely \\nsubjective (even for companies applying the same accounting principles), the profile of \\nEBIT can be impacted and may not be comparable from one company to another. In addi-\\ntion, accounting principles can set different rules for depreciation and amortisation. In such \\ncases, analysts and investors tend to compute EBITDA multiples instead of EBIT multiples.\\nAlthough we understand the logic of it, we do not recommend generalising this \\napproach to all sectors. The use of the EBITDA multiple will lead to overvaluing low-\\nmargin companies and undervaluing high-margin companies.\\n(c) Free cash ﬂow multiple\\nThe free cash flow multiple is computed as enterprise value/free cash flow to the firm (i.e. \\nEBITDA – theoretical tax on EBIT – change in working capital – capex). Free cash flow \\nis, in fact, the sum that can be redistributed to the providers of the firm’s funds, therefore \\ntheoretically this multiple is highly relevant. It nevertheless suffers from its high volatil-\\nity, in particular because the capex policy of the firm may show some huge differences \\nfrom one year to another.\\nThis ratio is therefore relevant mainly for mature sectors where capex is mainly \\nmaintenance capex. The reverse of this multiple is called free cash flow yield.\\n(d) Price to book ratio (PBR)\\nThe PBR (price to book ratio) measures the ratio between market value and book \\nvalue:\\nPBR Price per share\\nBook value per share\\nMarket capitalisation\\nBoo== kk value ofequity (Net worth)'),\n",

Either \\nway, the result is the same.\\nIt may seem surprising to compare book value to market value which, as we have \\nseen, results from a company’s future cash flow. Even in the event of liquidation, equity \\nvalue can be below book value (due, for example, to restructuring costs, accounting \\nissues, etc.).\\nThere is no direct link between book value and market value.\\nHowever, there is an economic link between book value and market value, as long as book \\nvalue correctly reflects the market value of assets and liabilities.\\nIt is not hard to show that a stock’s PBR will be above 1 if its market value is above \\nbook value, when return on equity (ROE) is above the required rate of return ( kE). The \\nreason for this is that if a company consistently achieves 15% ROE, and the shareholders \\nrequire only 10%, a book value of 100 would mean an equity value of 150, and the share-\\nholders will have achieved their required rate of return:\\n15 100\\n150 10 , 1.5% %  and PBR× ==\\nHowever, the PBR will be below 1 if ROE is below the required rate of return (kE).\\nA sector cannot show equity value below book value for long as sector consolidation \\nwill soon intervene and re-establish balance, assuming that markets are efficient. Nor can \\na sector have equity value higher than book value for long as new entrants will be attracted \\nto the sector and bring down the abnormally high returns.

At \\naround a third, its payout is lower than average, but as is often the case with family-owned \\nfirms their dividend distribution policy is quite conservative.\\nAlthough Indesit’s free float is low (30%), the market for the stock is liquid (0.5% of \\ntotal equity exchanged every day on average, 13 analysts covering the stock) so the above \\ncomments apply here.11 See Section 22.4.\\nKEY MARKET DATA ON INDESIT\\nIn Euros Past\\n2012\\n2013 Current \\n2014\\nFuture \\n2015\\nAdjusted share price\\nHigh 5.55 8.46 10.10\\nLow 2.63 4.44 8.17\\nAverage or last 3.85 6.01 10.04\\nAbsolute data\\nNumber of fully diluted shares (m) 103 103 103\\nMarket capitalisation (m) 397 619 1034\\nEquity, group share (m) 686 496 645 695\\nValue of net debt (m) 353 426 366 316\\nEnterprise value (m) 750 1045 1400\\nMultiples\\nFully diluted EPS 0.60 0.03 0.43 0.73\\nEPS growth−5% −95% 1333% 70%\\nP/E 6.4 200 23.3\\nAfter-tax operating proﬁt (m) 67.5 40.8 60 88\\nEBIT multiple 11.1 25.6 23.3\\nPrice/book ratio (PBV) 0.58 1.2 1.6\\nDividend\\nDividend per share (DPS) 0.20 0.01 0.12 0.20\\nDPS growth−13% −95% 1100% 67%\\nNet yield 5.2% 0.0% 3.6%\\nPayout 33% 33% 28% 27%\\nReturn\\nBeta (β) 1.10 1.13 1.10 1.0\\nRisk premium: rM – rF 6.1% 5.5% 5.8%'),\n",

Prices prior to the \\ndetachment of a right are adjusted by multiplying them by what is called the “adjust-\\nment coefﬁcient” .\\n(a) Free share awards\\nSuppose a company decides to double its equity by incorporating its reserves, and issues \\none new share for each existing share. Each shareholder is then the owner of twice as \\nmany shares without having paid in additional funds and with no change to the company’s \\nfinancial structure. The unit value of the shares has simply been divided into two.\\nNaturally, the company’s equity value will not change, as two shares will be equal to \\none previously existing share. However, the share price before and after the operation will \\nhave to be adjusted to obtain a comparable series.\\nIn this case, simply divide the shares existing after the free share award by two. The \\nadjustment coefficient is 1/2.\\nMore generally, if N′ new shares are issued for N already existing shares, the adjust-\\nment coefficient is as follows:\\nN\\nNN+ ′'),\n",

We will go further \\ninto detail in Chapter 25, which deals with share offerings.\\nTo subscribe to the new shares, investors must first buy one or more rights detached \\nfrom previously existing shares, whose price is theoretically such that it doesn’t matter \\nwhether they buy previous existing shares or use the rights to buy new ones. The detach-\\nment of the right from the existing shares makes an adjustment necessary.\\nFor a rights issue, the adjustment coefficient is:\\nShare price after detachment\\nShare price before detachment\\nShare p= rrice after detachment Rights\\nShare price before detachment\\n−\\nIf P is the price of the already existing share, E the issue price of the new shares, N′ \\nthe number of new shares and N the number of already existing shares, the adjustment \\ncoefficient will be equal to:\\nNP N E\\nNN P\\n××\\n×\\n′\\n′\\n+\\n+\\n \\n  ()\\nMore generally, the adjustment coefﬁcient is equal to the price after detachment of the \\nright (either the right to receive a free share or the right to buy a new one) divided by \\nthe price before detachment of the right. Henceforth, we will assume all prices to have \\nbeen adjusted.\\nTo make the adjustment, simply multiply all the share data (e.g. price, EPS, DPS, BV/S) \\nbefore the detachment by this coefficient.\\nAs you have seen, the adjustment consists in rewriting past stock performance to \\nmake it comparable to today and tomorrow, and not the reverse.\\n2/ THE IMPACT  OF FUTURE  TRANSACTIONS\\nWhen equity-linked securities (convertible bonds, mandatory convertibles, bonds with \\nwarrants attached, stock options, etc.) have been issued, financial managers must factor \\nthese potential new shares into their per-share data. Here again, we must adjust in order to \\nobtain an average number of outstanding shares.\\nAs there is at least potential dilution, we have to assume full conversion in calculat-\\ning the per-share data (EPS, BV/S, etc.) on a fully diluted basis. This is easy to do for \\nconvertible bonds (CBs). Simply assume that the CBs have been converted. This increases \\nthe number of shares but lowers financing costs, as interest is no longer paid on the CBs.\\nFor warrants (or stock options), two methods can be used. The first method, called \\nthe treasury method , is commonly used: it assumes investors will exercise their in- \\nthe-money warrants and the company will buy back its own shares with the proceeds. The \\ncompany thus offsets some of the dilution caused by the exercise of the warrants. This is \\nthe method recommended by the IASB.'),\n",

The exercise of \\nthe warrants raises the following sum for the company: 100 000 × €240 = €24 000 000.\\nThe company could use this money to buy back 80 000 of its own shares trading at \\n€300. Fully diluted EPS can be computed as follows:\\n2014 EPS = 10 000 000/(1 000 000 + 100 000 – 80 000) = €9.80\\nNote that only in-the-money diluting securities are restated; out-the-money securities \\nare not taken into account.\\nThe second method, called the investment of funds method, assumes that all inves-\\ntors will exercise their warrants and that the company will place the proceeds in a finan-\\ncial investment. Let’s go back to that last example and use this method.\\nIn this method, we assume all warrants are exercised by investors and the proceeds \\nare invested at 3% after taxes 2 pending use in the company’s industrial projects. Fully \\ndiluted EPS would be as follows:\\nEPS = ××+\\n+ =100 000 240 3% 10 000 000\\n1 000 000 100 000  \\n€9.75\\nAs can be seen, the two methods produce different results as a direct consequence of the \\ndifferent uses of the cash proceeding from the exercise of warrants.\\nThe treasury method can be considered to be the closest to the financial markets, \\nas the main figure it uses is the company’s share price. However, the treasury method \\nassumes that the best investment for a company is to buy back its own shares.\\n2 Depending on \\nthe case, we can \\nassume either \\nthe company’s \\naverage rate \\non short-term \\ninvestment or the \\nweighted average \\ncost of capital.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nA stock market analysis of a ﬁrm should be performed after having checked the liquidity of \\nthe stock and understood the shareholder base. It is centered on stock market performance \\nwhich should be compared to the ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm, multiples (especially \\nP/E), dividends and returns, compared with required returns.\\nDividends are analysed by looking at returns (dividend on the share price) and the payout \\nratio (dividend on net proﬁt).\\nThe P/E (price to earnings ratio) is the ratio of the value of the share to EPS (earnings per \\nshare). Changes in P/E follow future EPS growth and move in the opposite direction from \\ninterest rates and risk (ﬁnancial and operational).\\nIt is only when the company pays out all of its proﬁts and when ﬁnancial and industrial mar-\\nkets are in equilibrium that inverse P/E (also called earnings yield) is equal to shareholders’ \\nrequired rate of return. Generally, the inverse P/E criterion results in an underestimation of \\nshareholders’ required rate of return.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

The study \\nof options is useful from a purely financial point of view, as it highlights the notion of \\nremuneration of risk.\\nTrue, options are more complex than shares or bonds. Moreover, in their daily use \\nthey have more to do with financial management than finance. However, we will see that \\nmany financial assets (warrants, stock options) can be analysed as options or as the com-\\nbination of an option and a less risky asset. Have some fun by discovering the options \\nhidden in any financial product!\\nA convertible bond can be seen as a combination of a conventional bond and an \\noption. An undrawn revolving credit facility can be analysed as an option on a loan.\\nWe will also examine how options theory can be applied to major financial strategy \\ndecisions within a company.\\nOptions are an effective tool of analysis whose applications are limited only by ﬁnancial \\nmanagers’ imaginations.\\nThe purpose of this chapter is not to make you a wizard in manipulating options or to \\nteach you the techniques of speculation or hedging with options, but merely to show you \\nhow they work in practice.\\nSection 23.1\\nDEFINITION AND THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF OPTIONS\\nAn option gives you the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price during a \\npredetermined period.\\n1/ SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS\\nThere are call (buy) options and put (sell) options. The asset that can thereby be bought \\nor sold is called the underlying asset. This can be either a financial asset (stock, bond, '),\n",

The holder of an option may exercise it (i.e. buy the underlying asset if he holds \\na call option or sell it if he holds a put option) either at a given date ( exercise date )\\nor at any time during a period called the exercise period, depending on the type of \\noption held.\\nA distinction is made between US-style options (the holder can exercise his right at \\nany moment during the exercise period) and European-style options (the holder can only \\nexercise his right on the exercise date). Most listed options are US-style options, and they \\nare found on both sides of the Atlantic, whereas most over-the-counter (OTC) options are \\nEuropean-style.\\nLegally speaking, call options are a promise to sell made by the seller of the call option \\nto the buyer of the call option.\\nHere are two examples:\\nLet’s say Peter sells Helmut a call option on the insurance company Allianz \\nhaving an €85 strike price and maturing in nine months. For nine months (US-style \\noption) or after nine months (European-style option), Helmut will have the right to buy \\none Allianz share at a price of €85, regardless of Allianz’s share price at that moment. \\nHelmut is not required to buy a share of Allianz from Peter, but if Helmut wants to, Peter \\nmust sell him one for €85.\\nObviously, Helmut will exercise his option only if Allianz’s share price is above €85.\\nOtherwise, if he wants to buy an Allianz share, he will simply buy it on the market for \\nless than €85.\\nNow let’s say that Paul buys from Clara put options on $1m in currency at an exchange \\nrate of €1.1/$, exercisable six months from now. Paul may, in six months’ time (if it’s a \\nEuropean-style option) sell $1m to Clara at €1.1/$, regardless of the dollar’s exchange \\nrate at that moment. Paul is not required to sell dollars to Clara but, if he wants to, Clara \\nmust buy them from him at the agreed price.\\nObviously, Paul will only exercise his option if the dollar is trading below €1.1.\\nLegally speaking, put options are a promise to buy made by the seller of the put option \\nto the buyer of the put option.\\nThe above examples highlight the fundamentally asymmetric character of an option. \\nAn option contract does not grant the same rights or obligations to each side. The buyer \\nof any option has the right but not the obligation, whereas the seller of any option is \\nobliged to follow through if the buyer requests.\\nThe value at which an option is bought or sold is sometimes called the premium. It is \\nobviously paid by the buyer to the seller, who thereby obtains some financial compensa-\\ntion for a situation in which he has all the obligations and no rights.\\nHence, a more precise definition of an option would be:\\nAn option is a contract between two sides, under which one side gives the other side the \\nright (but not the obligation) to buy from him (a call option) or to sell to him (a put \\noption) an asset, in exchange for the payment of a premium.'),\n",

What purpose would an option have, \\ni.e. the right to buy or sell, if we already knew what the price would be at maturity? What \\npurpose would a call option on Siemens serve, at a strike price of €170, if we already \\nknew that Siemens’s share price would be below €160 at maturity and that the option \\nwould therefore not be exercised? And if we knew that, at maturity, Siemens’s share price \\nwould be €250, the price of the option would be such that it would offer the risk-free rate, \\njust like Siemens’s shares, since the future would be known with certainty.\\nOptions would not exist if the future were known with certainty. In a risky environment, \\noptions remunerate the risk of an uncertain future. The basis of an option is therefore \\nthe remuneration of risk.\\nOptions might therefore be called pure financial products, as they are merely remunera-\\ntion of risk. There is no other basis to the value of an option.\\nMore generally, all risk premiums are a sort of option.\\nSection 23.2\\nMECHANISMS USED IN PRICING OPTIONS\\nLet’s suppose that Felipe buys a call option on Solvay at a €50 strike price, maturing in \\nnine months, and simultaneously sells a put option on the same stock at a €50 strike \\nmaturing in nine months. Assuming the funds paid for the call option are largely offset by \\nthe funds received for the sale of the put option, what will happen at maturity?\\nIf Solvay is trading at above €50, Felipe will exercise his call option and pay €50. The put \\noption will not be exercised, as his counterparty will prefer to sell Solvay at the market price.\\nIf Solvay is trading below €50, Felipe will not exercise his call option, but the put \\noption that he sold will be exercised and Felipe will have to buy Solvay at €50.\\nHence, regardless of the price of the underlying asset, buying a call option and sell-\\ning a put option on the same underlying asset, at the same maturity and at the same strike \\nprice is the same thing as a forward purchase of the underlying asset at maturity at the \\nstrike price.\\nIn other words:\\nBuying a call option and selling a put option is a forward purchase of the underlying \\nasset; we say there is put–call parity.\\nAssuming fairly valued markets, we can thus deduce that at the maturity of the exercise \\nperiod:\\nValue at maturity of a call option – Value at maturity of a put option = Value at maturity \\nof the underlying asset – strike price'),\n",

For a put option, it’s the opposite. In the rest of this chapter, \\nunless otherwise mentioned, we will use call options as examples.\\nBy definition, intrinsic value is never negative.\\nLet’s take a call option on sterling, with a strike price of €1.5/£ and maturing at end-\\nDecember. Let’s say that it is now June and that the pound is trading at €1.6.\\nWhat is the option’s value? The holder of the option may buy a pound for €1.5, while \\nthe pound is currently at €1.6.\\nThis immediate possible gain is none other than the option’s intrinsic value, which \\nwill be billed by the seller of the option to the buyer. The option will be worth at least \\n€0.1.\\nTechnically, a call option is said to be:\\nt out of the money when the price of the underlying asset is below the strike price \\n(zero intrinsic value);\\nt at the money when the price of the underlying asset is equal to the strike price (zero \\nintrinsic value);\\nt in the money when the price of the underlying asset is above the strike price (positive \\nintrinsic value).\\nThe reader will have understood that a put option is said to be:\\ntout of the money when the price of the underlying asset is above the strike price \\n(zero intrinsic value);\\nt at the money when the price of the underlying asset is equal to the strike price (zero \\nintrinsic value);\\nt in the money when the price of the underlying asset is below the strike price (posi-\\ntive intrinsic value).'),\n",

The option would be out of \\nthe money (€1.4 is less than the €1.5 strike price) and the holder would not exercise it. \\nDoes this mean that the option is worthless? No, because there is still a chance, however \\nslight, that sterling will move over €1.5 by the end of December. This would make the \\noption worth exercising. So the option has some value, even though it is not worth exercis-\\ning right now. This is called time value.\\nFor an in-the-money option, i.e. whose strike price ( €1.5) is below the value of the \\nunderlying asset (let’s now assume that £1 = €1.7), intrinsic value is €0.2. But this intrin-\\nsic value is not all of the option’s value. Indeed, we have to add time value, which ulti-\\nmately is just the anticipation that intrinsic value will be higher than it is currently. For \\nthere is always a probability that the price of the underlying asset will rise, thus making it \\nmore worthwhile to wait to exercise the option.\\nThe anticipation of an even greater intrinsic value is called the time value of an option.\\nIn more concrete terms, time value represents “everything that could happen” from now \\nuntil the option matures.\\nHence:\\nAn option’s value = intrinsic value + time value.\\nValue of\\nthe option\\nValue of the underlying asset\\nTime value\\nValue of a call option\\nIntrinsic value\\nStrike price\\nValue of\\nthe option\\nUnderlying asset value\\nTime value\\nValue of a put option\\nIntrinsic value\\nExercise price'),\n",

Cash flow depends on whether or not the option will be exercised and the risk \\nvaries constantly. Hence, the further the option is into the money, the higher its intrinsic \\nvalue and the less risky it is.\\nCox et al. (1979) thus had the idea of using arbitrage logic in comparing the profit \\ngenerated with options, with a direct position on the underlying asset.\\nLet’s take the example of a call option with a €105 strike price on a given stock (cur-\\nrently trading at €100) and for a given maturity.\\nLet’s also assume that there are only two possibilities at the end of this period: either \\nthe stock is at €90 or it is at €110. At maturity, our option will be worth its intrinsic value, \\ni.e. either €0 or €5, or €0 or €20 if we held four options instead of just one.\\nWe can try to obtain the same result (€0 or €20) in the same conditions using another \\ncombination of securities (a so-called replicating portfolio). If we achieve this result, \\nthe four call options and this other combination of securities should have the same value. \\nIf we can determine the value of this other combination of securities, we will have suc-\\nceeded in valuing the call option.\\nTo do so, let’s say you borrow (at 5%, for example) a sum whose value (principal and \\ninterest) will be €90 at the end of the period concerned, and then buy a share for €100 today.\\nAt the end of the period:\\n t either the share is worth €110, in which case the combination of buying the share and \\nborrowing money is worth €110 − €90 = €20; or\\n t the share is worth €90, in which case the replicating portfolio is worth 90 − 90 = 0.'),\n",

Otherwise, arbitrage traders \\nwould quickly intervene to re-establish the balance. So what is the original value of this \\ncombination? Let’s look at it this way: €14.3 corresponds also to the value of the four \\ncall options. We thus deduce that the call option at a €105 strike is worth €3.58. We have \\nvalued the option using arbitrage theory.\\nPurchase of a share: €100\\n− borrowing of a sum that at maturity would be worth €90, hence, at 5%, 90/1.05 \\n= €85.7\\n= Value: €14.3\\n“Delta” is the number of shares that must be bought to duplicate an option. In our \\nexample, four calls produce a profit equivalent to the purchase of one share. The option’s \\ndelta is therefore 1/4, or 0.25.\\nMore generally, delta is deﬁned as the ratio between the variation in the option’s value, \\nand the variation in the price of the underlying asset.\\nHence:\\nδ = −\\n− =50\\n110 90 02 5.\\nWe can therefore conclude that:\\nValue of a call option = δ × (Price of the underlying asset − PV of capital borrowed)\\nOur example above obviously oversimplifies in assuming that the underlying asset can \\nonly have two values at the end of the period. However, now that we have understood \\nthe mechanism, we can go ahead and reproduce the model in backing up two peri-\\nods (and not just one) before the option matures. This is called the binomial method, \\nbecause there are two possible states at each step. By multiplying the number of peri-\\nods or subdividing each period into subperiods, we can obtain a very large number \\nof very small subperiods until we have a very large number of values for the stock at \\nthe option’s maturity date, which is more realistic than the simplified schema that we \\ndeveloped above.'),\n",

The \\ndevelopers of the model used the following assumptions:\\n t no dividend payout throughout the option’s life;\\n t constant volatility in the underlying asset over the life of the option, as well as the \\ninterest rate;\\n t liquidity of the underlying asset so that it can be bought and sold continuously, with \\nno intermediation costs; \\n t that market participants behave rationally!\\nMore complex models have been derived from Black and Scholes to surmount these prac-\\ntical constraints. The main ones are those of Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) for currency \\noptions and Merton (1976), which reflects the impact of the payment of a coupon during \\nthe life of a European-style option.\\nUS-style options are more difficult to analyse and depend on whether or not the \\nunderlying share pays out a dividend:\\n t If the share pays no dividend, the holder of the option has no reason to exercise it \\nbefore it matures. He will sell his option rather than exercise it, as exercising it will \\nmake it lose its time value. In this case, the value of the US-style call option is thus \\nidentical to the value of a European-style call option.\\n t If the share does pay a dividend, the holder of the call may find it worthwhile to \\nexercise his option the day before the dividend is paid. To determine the precise value \\nof such an option, we have to use an iterative method requiring some calculations \\ndeveloped by Roll (1977).

In practice, this is rarely the \\ncase: market operators adjust upward and downward the historical volatility that they \\ncalculated (over 20 days, one month, six months, etc.) to reflect their anticipation of the \\nfuture stability or instability of the underlying asset. However, several classes of options \\n(same underlying, but different maturity or strike price) can be listed for the same under-\\nlying asset. This allows us to observe the implied volatility of their quoted prices and thus \\nvalue the options of another class.\\nThis is how anticipated volatility is obtained and is used to value options. This prac-\\ntice is so entrenched that options market traders trade anticipation of volatility directly.\\nAnticipated volatility is then applied to models to calculate the value of the premium.\\nThe Black–Scholes model can thus be used “backwards”, i.e. by taking the option’s \\nmarket price as a given and calculating implied volatility. The operator can then price \\noptions by tweaking the price on the basis of his own anticipation. He buys options whose \\nvolatility looks too low and sells those whose implied volatility looks too high.\\nIt is interesting to note that, despite these simplifying assumptions, the Black–Scho-\\nles model has been de facto adopted by market operators, each of them adapting it to the \\nunderlying asset concerned.\\nSection 23.6\\nTOOLS  FOR  MANAGING  AN OPTIONS  POSITION\\nManaging a portfolio of options (which can also be composed of underlying assets or \\nthe risk-free asset) requires some knowledge of four parameters of sensitivity that help \\nus measure precisely the risks assumed and develop speculative, hedging and arbitrage \\nstrategies.\\n1/ THE IMPACT  OF FLUCTUATIONS  IN THE  UNDERLYING  ASSET : DELTA  AND  GAMMA\\nWe have already discussed the delta, which measures the sensitivity of an option’s value \\nto fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset. For calls and puts that are significantly \\nout of the money, the value of the option may not change much when the underlying asset \\nmoves up or down. As the price of the underlying asset moves to a level substantially \\nabove the strike for calls or below the strike for puts, the option becomes more valuable \\nand more sensitive to changes in the underlying asset.'),\n",

Whether it is positive or negative depends on the type of option.\\nThe delta of a call option is positive, since an increase in the price of the underlying \\nasset increases the option’s value.\\nThe delta of a put option is negative, since an increase in the price of the underlying \\nasset lowers the option’s value.\\nWe have seen that, when using the Black–Scholes formula, the delta of a call option is \\nequal to N(d1). The delta of a put option is equal to N(d1) − 1. This relationship is prized \\nby managers of options portfolios, as it links the option’s value and the value of the \\nunderlying asset directly. Indeed, we have seen that the delta is, above all, an underlying \\nequivalent: a delta of 0.25 tells us that a share is equivalent to 4 options. But above all, \\nmanagers use the delta as an indicator of sensitivity: how much does the option’s value \\nvary in euros when the underlying asset varies by one euro?\\nThe delta of a call option far in-the-money is very close to 1, as any variation in the \\nunderlying asset will show up directly in the option’s value, which is essentially made up \\nof intrinsic value.\\nSimilarly, a call option that is far out-of-the-money is composed solely of its time \\nvalue and a variation in the underlying asset has little influence on its value. Its delta is \\nthus close to 0.\\nThe delta of an at-the-money call option is close to 0.5, indicating that the option has \\nas much chance as not of being exercised.\\nThis is expressed in the following table:\\nOut-of-the-money At-the-money In-the-money\\nCall option 0 < delta < 0.5 delta = 0.5 0.5 < delta < 1\\nPut option −0.5 < delta < 0 delta =− 0.5 −1 < delta <− 0.5\\nThe delta can also express probability of expiration in-the-money for options close to \\nmaturity and whose underlying asset is not too volatile: a delta of 0.80 means that there is \\nan 80% probability that the option will expire in-the-money.\\nUnfortunately, the delta itself varies with fluctuations in the underlying asset and with \\nthe passing of time.\\nChanges in the delta of an option create either a risk or an opportunity for investors and \\ntraders. Hence, the idea of measuring the sensitivity of delta to variations in the value of the \\nunderlying asset: this is what gamma does. Mathematically, it is none other than a deriva-\\ntive of the delta vis-à-vis the underlying asset, and is often called the delta of the delta!\\nThe gamma of an option is largest near the strike price. A zero-gamma options posi-\\ntion is completely immune to fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset.\\n2/ THE IMPACT OF TIME : THETA\\nOptions are like people: they run down with time.

Theta measures how much an option \\nloses in value if no other factors change.\\n3/ THE IMPACT  OF VOLATILITY : VEGA\\nThe vega can be defined as the rate of change in the derivative of the theoretical value \\nof the option vis-à-vis implied volatility. Vega is always positive for a call option, as for \\na put option, as we have seen that the time value of an option is an increasing function \\nof volatility.\\nAll other factors being equal, the closer an option is to being in the money (with \\nmaximum time value), the greater the impact of an increase in volatility.\\nWhile each of the tools presented here is highly useful in and of itself, combining \\nthem tells us even more. In practice, it is impossible to create a position that is neutral on \\nall criteria at once. No return is possible when taking no risk. No pain, no gain! Hence, \\na delta-neutral position and a gamma-negative position must necessarily have a positive \\ntheta in order to be profitable.\\n4/ IMPLICIT  VOLATILITY\\nFrom 1990, the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) has calculated the VIX, an \\nindex of the implicit volatility of the Standard & Poor’s 100, using at-the-money options \\nwith a maturity shorter than one month.

The notion of model risk arose when some researchers noticed that the Black–\\nScholes model was biased, since (like many other models) it models share prices on the \\nbasis of a log-normal distribution. We have seen empirically that this type of distribution \\nsignificantly minimises the impact of extreme price swings.\\nGaussian distribution\\nReal distribution versus Gaussian\\nProbability\\nReal distribution?\\nReturns\\nTo simplify, we can say that the Black–Scholes model does not reﬂect the risk of a market \\ncrash.\\nThis has given rise to the notion of model risk, as almost all banks use the Black–\\nScholes model (or a model derived from it). Financial research has uncovered risks that \\nhad hitherto been ignored.\\nAn anomaly in the options market highlights the problems of the Black–Scholes \\nmodel. When we determine the implied volatility of an underlying asset (the only fac-\\ntor not likely to be observed directly) based on the price of various options having the \\nsame underlying asset, we can see that we do not find a single figure. Hence, the implied \\nvolatility on options far out-of-the-money or far in-the-money is higher than the implied \\nvolatility recalculated on the basis of at-the-money options. This phenomenon is called \\nthe volatility smile (because when we draw volatility on a chart as a function of strike \\nprice, it looks like a smile).\\nWe will see in the following chapters the many applications of options in corporate \\nfinance:\\n t to raise financing (see Chapter 25);\\n t to resolve conflicts between management and ownership or between ownership and \\nlenders (see Chapter 34);'),\n",

This \\nis why this chapter is so important.\\nAn option is a contract between two sides, under which one side gives the other the right \\n(but not the obligation) to buy from him (a call option) or sell to him (a put option) an \\nasset, in exchange for the payment of a premium. This asset will be bought (or sold) at a \\npredetermined price called the strike price, during a period of time (the exercise period for \\nUS-style options), or at a precise date (the exercise date for European-style options). The \\nbasis of an option is the remuneration of risk. The option cannot exist in a risk-free environ-\\nment and it thrives on risk.\\nThe value of an option (call or put) can be broken down into an intrinsic value and a time \\nvalue. The intrinsic value is the difference between the price of the underlying asset and the \\noption’s strike price. It can only be zero or positive. The time value is the premium on the \\nintrinsic value, which remunerates passing time.\\nThere are six criteria for determining the value of an option:\\ntthe price of the underlying asset;\\nt the strike price;\\nt the volatility of the underlying asset;\\nt the option’s maturity;\\nt the risk-free rate; and, if applicable,\\nt the dividend or the coupon if the underlying asset is a share or a bond that pays one or \\nthe other during the life of the option.\\nModels have been developed for valuing options, the main ones being the Black–Scholes \\nand binomial models. They have been adapted over time to make them less restrictive and \\ncapable of factoring in speciﬁc features.\\nLastly we looked at tools for managing an options position.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/Define a call or put option.\\n2/What are the six criteria for determining the value of an option?\\n3/What does the delta of an option indicate?\\nQUESTIONS'),\n",

It is an error to think this way. In markets in equilibrium, all sources \\nof financing have the same cost if one adjusts for the risk borne by the investor.\\nt To know whether a source of financing is cheap or dear, one must look past the \\napparent cost to the overall valuation of the financing. Only if securities have been \\nissued at prices higher than market value can one say that the cost of financing \\nis indeed lower.\\nt With the exception of products that exactly match a particular market demand, \\nsophisticated hybrid securities are costly to issue and sell. As such, they are a signal \\nto investors that the company, or its majority shareholder, is having trouble attracting \\ninvestors, perhaps because it is experiencing other difficulties.\\nt By emphasising the fundamental asymmetry of information between issuer and \\ninvestor, agency theory and signalling theory are both very useful for explaining the \\nappeal of products of this kind.\\nt Lastly, it must not be forgotten that corporate finance is not immune to fashion. Inves-\\ntors have a great appetite for novelty, especially if it gives them the feeling of doing \\nhigh finance!\\nSection 24.1\\nWARRANTS\\n1/ DEFINITION\\nA warrant is a security that allows the holder to subscribe to another newly issued secu-\\nrity (share, bond, or even another warrant) during a given period, in a proportion and at a \\nprice fixed in advance.\\nSubscription warrants may be attached to an issue of shares or bonds, in which case the \\nissue is said to be one of “shares cum warrants” or “bonds cum warrants”. Attached warrants '),\n",

Warrants can also be \\nissued and distributed to existing shareholders at no charge. Once securities with attached \\nwarrants have been issued, the whole is split into its two component parts: the shares or \\nbonds become traditional securities, and the warrants take on a life of their own. The war-\\nrants are traded separately after issue.\\nAs an illustration, the advertising group Publicis issued equity subscription warrants \\nin September 2002. One warrant in that issue allowed the holder to subscribe to one Pub-\\nlicis share at €30.5 from 24 September 2013 until 24 September 2022. In March 2014 the \\nPublicis warrants were trading at €37, whereas Publicis shares were trading at €67. They \\nwere deeply in the money.\\nAs liquidity in the stock and bond markets has increased, financial institutions have \\ntaken the opportunity to issue warrants on existing securities independently of the com-\\npany that issued the underlying shares. These securities are also called covered warrants \\nbecause the issuing institution covers itself by buying the underlying securities on the \\nmarket.\\nWarrants ordinarily involve a transaction between one investor and another and there-\\nfore play no direct role in financing a business. There being no limits to the imagination, \\nsome players have not hesitated in creating warrants on baskets of existing securities \\n(such as indices). Thus, a warrant on a basket of different shares gives one the right to \\nacquire during a given period of time, a lot consisting of those shares, in proportions and \\nat an overall price fixed in advance.\\n2/ VALUE\\nConceptually, a warrant is similar to a call option sold by a company on shares in issue \\nor to be issued. The exercise price of this option is the price at which the holder of the \\nwarrant can acquire the underlying security; the expiry date of the option is the same as \\nthe expiry date of the warrant.\\nA warrant, however, has a few particular characteristics that must be taken into \\naccount in its valuation:\\ntIt normally has a long life (typically two to three years), which increases its time \\nvalue and makes it more difficult to accept the assumption of constancy in interest \\nrates and volatility used in the Black–Scholes model.\\nt The underlying asset is more likely to pay a periodic return during the time the war-\\nrant is held:\\n○ For an equity warrant, the payment of dividends on the underlying share lowers \\nthe value of that share and thereby reduces the value of the warrant. More gener-\\nally, any transaction that changes the value of the share affects the value of the \\nwarrant.\\n○ For a debt warrant, the price of the underlying bond varies over time and, as we \\nsaw in Chapter 20, the closer a bond comes to maturity, the more its market price \\ntends towards its redemption price. Its volatility gradually declines, making the \\nBlack–Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, inapplicable as stated.\\nt Lastly, in the case of subscription warrants, the dilution associated with exercise of \\nthe warrants entails a gradual change in the value of the underlying security. When '),\n",

When investors exercise call \\noptions, no change in outstanding shares occurs as call options are options on shares \\nthat already exist and not on new shares to be issued; hence, the firm receives no cash.\\nTo get round these difficulties, traders use models derived from the binomial and Black–\\nScholes models, taking into account the fact that the exercise of warrants can create more \\nshares and thus affect the stock price. \\n3/ THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\\nAgency theory offers an almost “psychological” approach to these hybrid securities. They \\nare seen as a preferred means of resolving conflicts between shareholders, creditors and \\nmanagers.\\nTake a bond with attached equity warrant as an example. A hybrid security of this \\nkind may seem unnatural since it combines a low-risk asset (bond) with a high-risk asset \\n(share).\\nHowever, there is something in it for each of the parties.\\nThe company’s managers benefit from the flexibility that warrants provide, since the \\ncompany can set bounds on the date of the capital increase (by setting the subscription \\nperiod of the warrant) and the amount of funds that will be raised (by setting the exercise \\nprice and the number of warrants per bond at appropriate levels). The amount of funds \\nraised in the form of bonds can be completely different from the amount potentially raised \\nlater in the form of shares. Furthermore, the company may be able to use the funds from \\nboth sources for several years since the warrants may be exercised before the bonds are \\npaid off.\\nA company that wants to accomplish the capital increase part of the issue quickly \\nwill set an exercise price barely above, or even below, the current value of the share. If it \\nchooses, it can also move up the beginning of the subscription period. If it prefers to bring \\nin a greater amount of funds, it will increase the number of warrants per bond (which must \\nthen have a lower yield to maturity if equilibrium is to be maintained) and/or raise the \\nexercise price of the warrants.\\nBecause it entails selling an option, though, the opportunity cost of a warrant can be \\nsubstantial. Take the case of a company that has sold for €10 the right to buy one share \\nat €100. Suppose that at the time this warrant becomes exercisable, the shares are trad-\\ning at €210. A straight capital increase without a rights issue at a very slight discount to \\nthe share price would bring in, say, €205 per share, whereas exercise of the warrants will \\nbring in €110 per share all told. The opportunity cost is €95 per share.\\nStock market history has shown that exercise of warrants can never be taken for \\ngranted. In the euphoria of the speculative bubble, many Internet companies issued war-\\nrants with high exercise prices that were never exercised.\\nThe holders of bonds with attached equity warrants, if they keep both securities, are \\nboth creditors and potential shareholders. As creditors, they benefit from a small but rela-\\ntively certain yield; as potential shareholders, they have hope of realising a capital gain.\\nIn a context of rising interest rates and falling share prices, however, holders of bonds \\ncum warrants suffer the downside risks of both debt and equity securities instead of com-\\nbining their advantages.'),\n",

The bonds may end up with investors preferring a fixed-rate security, while the \\nwarrants go to investors seeking a more volatile security.\\nIn appearance only, existing shareholders retain their proportionate equity stake in \\nthe company. The warrant mechanism makes for gradual dilution over time. An issue of \\nbonds with equity warrants allows existing shareholders to maintain their control over \\nthe company with a smaller outlay of funds, since they can buy the warrants and resell \\nthe bonds. If they do this, the securities they will end up holding will be much riskier \\noverall because the bonds will no longer be there to cushion fluctuations in the value of \\nthe warrants.\\nThe dilution problem is postponed, but when the warrants are exercised, they may \\nhave risen in value to such an extent that existing shareholders can pay for virtually all of \\ntheir proportionate share of the capital increase by selling their warrants.\\n4/ PRACTICAL USES\\nWarrants are increasingly widely used in corporate finance:\\ntA company in difficulty that wants to raise fresh capital. Before going ahead with \\na capital increase, the company decides to make a bonus distribution of warrants to \\nexisting shareholders. In practice, the shareholders are giving themselves these war-\\nrants. They can then speculate more readily on the company’s turnaround.\\nt When creditors are cancelling debts due to them , shareholders may give them \\nequity warrants in return. The value of these warrants is virtually nil at the start, but if \\nthe company regains its footing, the warrants will rise in value and make up for some \\nor all of the loss on the cancelled debts. A deal of this kind is the way to reconcile the \\nnormally divergent interests of creditors and shareholders. In modern finance, this \\ntechnique replaces the “return to better fortune” clause in loan agreements.\\nt In a tender offer for shares of company A in exchange for shares of company B, \\nshareholders of A may be offered not only shares of B but also warrants for shares of B.\\nt In a leveraged buyout (LBO, see Chapter 46), warrants may be used to offer an \\nadditional reward to holders of mezzanine debt or even to management (another \\ninstance of an “equity kicker”).\\nt As a management-incentivisation tool, warrants can be used as an alternative to \\nstock options. The key difference lies in the fact that warrants have to be acquired by \\nmanagement (whereas stock options are distributed free of charge).\\nThe reader must nevertheless be wary of throwing in “free” equity warrants as a miracle \\nremedy to ensure the success of a deal. It must not be forgotten that warrants entail poten-\\ntial dilution – and that in finance nothing is ever free!\\n5/ REEDEMABLE WARRANTS\\nReedemable warrants are warrants that can be reedemed by the issuer.

It may begin \\non the issue date or later. It may run to the maturity date, or a decision may be forced if the \\ncompany calls the bonds before maturity, in which case investors must choose between \\nconverting or redeeming them.\\nThe bond may be convertible into one or more shares (one share for each bond in \\nour example). This ratio, called the conversion ratio,1 is set at the time of issue. The \\nconversion ratio is adjusted for any equity issues or buy-backs, mergers, asset distribu-\\ntions or distributions of bonus shares in order to preserve the rights of holders of the \\nconvertibles as if they were shareholders at the time of issue.\\nThe conversion premium is the amount by which the conversion price exceeds the \\ncurrent market price of the share. A conversion premium is typical. In our Tesla Motors \\nexample, the conversion premium is 42.5%.2 Since Tesla Motors offered no redemption \\npremium, its shares must rise 42.5% by the maturity date of the bonds for investors to be \\nwilling to convert their bonds into shares rather than redeem them for cash. The calcula-\\ntion is slightly different when a redemption premium is involved.\\nSome convertible bonds are issued with a call provision that allows the issuer to buy \\nthem back at a predetermined price. Holders must then choose between redeeming for \\ncash or converting into shares. The indenture may provide for a minimum period of time \\nduring which the call provision may not be exercised (“hard non-call” period, usually at \\nleast one year) and/or set a condition for exercising the call provision, such as that the \\nshare price exceeds the conversion price by more than 25% or 30% (“soft call” provision).\\nIn some cases, the issuer may, at conversion, provide either newly issued shares or \\nexisting shares held in portfolio – for example, following a share buy-back. In other cases, \\nthe issuer has the right to provide the counter value in cash of the shares that were to be \\ngiven for repayment. This makes it possible to limit the dilution of current shareholders.\\nConvertible bonds must not be confused with the similar-sounding exchangeable\\nbonds, which are pure debt securities from the point of view of investors. We are going \\nto study them in Section 24.4.\\n2/ VALUE\\nThe value of a convertible bond during its life is the sum of three components.3\\n1. the value of the straight bond alone is called the investment value (or just the bond\\nvalue) of the convertible bond.

The value of a convertible generally exceeds both the straight \\nbond and the conversion value because holders of convertibles have the option to \\nwait and convert later on (time value of the option). The option to take advantage \\nof whichever is greater in the future – the straight bond value or the conversion \\nvalue – raises the value of the convertible over both the straight bond and the con-\\nversion value.\\nValue of a convertible bond\\n= The greater of a Straight bond + Option value\\nWhen the value of the firm is low, the value of the convertible tends to be mostly influ-\\nenced by the value of the straight debt. The opposite happens when the value of the \\nfirm is very high: the value is mostly influenced by the conversion value. Graphically, \\nwe have:\\nOption value\\nValue of the convertible bond\\nValue of a convertible bond\\nConversion value\\nBond value\\nExercise price Value of the share\\nWhenever the share price is well above the redemption value of the convertible \\nbond, as in the “share” zone of the following chart, the convertible bond behaves more \\nand more like the share because the probability that it will be converted into shares is \\nvery high.\\nIn the “bond” zone, the convertible bond behaves essentially like a bond because, \\ngiven the level and trend of the share price, the probability of conversion is low. The price \\nof the convertible bond is close to its investment value.\\nIn the “hybrid” zone, the value of the convertible reflects the simultaneous influence \\nof both the level of interest rates and the price of the underlying security.\\nThere can also be a high-risk zone for the convertible bond if the share price has \\nfallen sharply. Heavy doubts appear as to the company’s ability to repay its debts. The \\nprice of the convertible bond adjusts downwards accordingly, until it offers a yield to \\nmaturity consistent with the risk of default by the issuer.'),\n",

The bond value thus rep-\\nresents a minimum value: the convertible will never be worth less than this floor value, \\neven if the share price falls significantly. It also cushions the impact of a falling share price \\non the price of the convertible. Bear in mind, though, that investment value is not a fixed \\nnumber but one that varies as a function of changes in interest rates.\\n3/ THEORETICAL  ANALYSIS\\nUnlike a bond with attached equity warrants, a convertible bond is an indivisible product. \\nThe straight bond cannot be sold separately from the call option.\\nFor the investor, the convertible bond is often presented as a miracle product, with \\ndownside protection by virtue of its debt component and upside potential by virtue of its \\nequity component.\\nIn much the same fashion, the convertible bond is pitched to issuers as the panacea of \\ncorporate finance. Initially, it enables the company to issue debt at an interest rate lower \\nthan the normal market rate; at a later point, it may enable the company to issue fresh \\nequity at a price higher than the current share price.\\nNo, there are no miracles in finance. At best, one can find mirages, and this is one. If \\nthe company is able to issue bonds at an interest rate below its normal cost of debt, it is \\nbecause it has agreed to issue shares in the future at a price ($252.2 in our Tesla Motors \\nexample) below the share value at that time – necessarily below, or conversion would \\nnot take place. Current shareholders will therefore be diluted on poor terms for them .  \\nThe convertible \\nissued by Air \\nFrance KLM \\nin April 2005 \\nbehaved like a \\nbond when ﬁrst \\nissued, but from \\nOctober 2006 \\nuntil October \\n2007 it had \\nbecome virtually \\nindistinguishable \\nfrom the share.

The company is selling investors call options, which they pay for by accepting a \\nlower interest rate on the bonds than the company could normally obtain given its risk.\\nThe cost of a convertible bond may be calculated in intuitive fashion as a weighted \\naverage of the cost of equity and the cost of debt. The weighting corresponds to the prob-\\nability that the convertible will actually be converted. This probability is not hard to esti-\\nmate if one assumes that returns on the share are normally distributed (then the expected \\nyearly increase in share price is equal to the cost of equity less the dividend yield).\\nEquilibrium market theory is not of much help in explaining why convertible bonds, \\nwhich are no more than a combination of two existing products, should themselves \\nexist. Unsurprisingly, agency theory and signalling theory – together with the “matching \\nhypothesis” – are far more useful in understanding the usefulness of convertibles.\\ntAccording to agency theory, a convertible bond is a mode of resolving conflicts \\nbetween shareholders and creditors . The temptation of managers of leveraged\\ncompanies is to undertake risky investments that increase shareholder wealth at the \\ncreditors’ expense. With this fear in mind, creditors refuse to finance the company \\nexcept via convertible bonds. Creditors will then have some protection, since the con-\\nvertible gives them the option of becoming shareholders if there are transfers of value \\nworking against them as creditors. A heavily indebted company may have to pass up \\nhighly profitable investment projects if it cannot obtain bank financing that would \\nnot put too great a strain on its cash flow at the start. With its low apparent interest \\ncost, the convertible bond is an attractive alternative. A convertible bond also helps in \\nresolving conflicts between shareholder-managers and outside shareholders.A\\nshareholder-manager of a company with convertible bonds outstanding will hesitate \\nto divert company resources to private use at the expense of other shareholders, since \\nhe knows that would increase the probability of having to redeem the convertibles \\nin cash. If the company is already carrying a sufficiently high debt load, redemption \\ncould put it in difficulty and threaten the manager’s position, so he is deterred from \\ntaking such action.\\nt The matching hypothesis provides another contribution to the explanation of why \\nconvertible bonds exist. A young, fast-growing company or one with limited financial \\nresources will avoid taking on too much debt, as its cash flow is likely to be highly \\nvariable and its cost of debt, given its short history, likewise high. In these cases, it \\nmakes sense to issue securities whose cash flows match those of the firm, as was the \\ncase for Tesla Motors.\\nt A fast-growing company will have little inclination to issue more shares, either \\nbecause it believes its shares are undervalued or because it fears sending out a nega-\\ntive signal (see Chapter 38). That leaves only convertible bonds. Investors, relieved \\nthat the signal associated with a capital increase has not been sent, will welcome an \\nissue of convertibles. This is what the signalling theory assumes.'),\n",

We could also add another explanation, which is \\ncommonly known as the “backdoor equity” hypothesis. Young, growing firms cannot \\nusually issue debt because of the high financial distress costs. At the same time, they may \\nbe unwilling to issue equity if current stock prices are too low. Thus, convertible bonds \\ncould offer a good compromise solution. Convertible bonds cause expensive dilution, but \\nit occurs when the firm can afford it!4\\nThe market for convertibles is also supplied by large groups (e.g. Air France KLM, \\nArcelorMittal), which use it to raise funds from specialised investors that invest only \\nin convertible bonds. For these large groups, convertibles offer a way of diversifying \\nthe investor base and raising money in large quantities more easily. Lastly, groups in \\nfinancial difficulty will resort to issuing convertibles when the equity market is closed \\nto them.\\nSection 24.3\\nPREFERENCE SHARES\\nThe securities called preference shares (a term prevailing in the United Kingdom) or \\npreferred shares (a term prevailing in the United States) enjoy economic advantages \\nover ordinary shares, typically in return for a total or partial absence of voting rights.\\n1/ DEFINITION\\nPreference shares are created on the occasion of a capital increase by the decision of the \\nshareholders at an (extraordinary where applicable) general meeting.\\nThe advantages conferred on preference shares may include:\\nt a claim to a higher proportion of earnings than is paid out on other shares;\\nt priority in dividend distributions, meaning the dividend on preference shares must be \\npaid before any ordinary dividend is paid on other shares;\\nt a cumulative dividend, so that if earnings are insufficient to pay the preference divi-\\ndend in full, the amount not distributed becomes payable from future earnings;\\nt a firm cannot go into default if it misses paying some dividends;\\nt rating agencies and financial analysts consider preference shares a part of equity \\n(thus improving the rating of the company).\\nAt the same time, there are two important disadvantages in issuing preference shares.\\ntfor the issuer – because the dividends may not be tax-deductible;5\\nt for the investors – because they may have limited voting rights.\\nWe should note here that the term “preferred securities” (often shortened to just “pre-\\nferreds”), is much broader in scope and may encompass convertible bonds and subordinated \\ndebt securities as well as preference shares without voting rights. The reader is advised to \\nlook closely at the detailed characteristics of any security called a “preferred” and not to \\nassume that it is necessarily a preference share.\\n4 A similar ratio-\\nnale is offered by \\nMayers (1998). \\nIf a company \\nhas many real \\noptions it needs \\nthe capital in two \\nstages: the first \\nstage is used to \\nprove that the \\nreal investment \\noptions may be \\nworth pursuing; \\nthe second, \\nto exploit the \\noption effectively. \\nCorporations \\nmay prefer to use \\nconvertible debt \\nbecause it can \\nbe designed in \\nsuch a way that \\ninvestors can \\nallow the firm to \\nexercise (in pro-\\nviding equity) the \\nreal options only \\nif they turn out \\nto be valuable, \\nor abandon the \\nconversion option \\nif the real option \\ndisappears (thus \\navoiding the \\noverinvestment \\nproblem of com-\\npanies with high \\nliquidity and no \\ngood investment \\nopportunities).\\n5This is not \\nalways true. In \\nthe United States, \\nfor example, \\ncompanies do \\nnot have to pay \\ntaxes on 70% \\nof the preferred \\ndividends they \\nreceive on \\npreference shares \\ninvestments \\nthey have made \\nin other firms. \\nThis tax saving \\nmight then be \\nshared with the \\nissuing company, \\nenabling the \\ncompany to bring \\nthe preferred \\ndividend rate \\ndown.'),\n",

The latter is generally set as a function of earnings;\\nt trust preference share: the dividend on these stocks is tax-deductible like interest \\nexpenses. Firms issuing this security get the tax shield of debt and keep leverage low \\n(because preference shares are treated like equity by analysts and rating agencies).\\n2/ VALUE\\nIt is complex to generalise the valuation formula of preference shares as the term covers \\nproducts that can have very different features.\\nPreference shares will normally be valued just like ordinary shares (taking into \\naccount the potential higher dividend stream). The value of the preference share will be \\nequal to the value of the ordinary share to which you need to:\\ntadd the value of the advantages granted;\\nt deduct a liquidity discount (as the preference share will generally have low liquidity). \\nThis discount is almost always observed in trading prices;\\nt potentially deduct the value of the voting right.\\nAs each of these elements is difficult to assess, the value of the preference share will be \\nquite uncertain.\\n3/ THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\\n(a) For the company\\nPreference shares can enable a company which is in difficulty but has a good chance of \\nrecovering to attract investors by granting them special advantages.\\nBanks are often issuers of preference shares because these securities are classified by \\ncentral banks as part of the bank’s own funds for the purpose of determining its net capi-\\ntal. This is so even though the preference share pays a constant annual dividend expressed \\nas a percentage of par value, which gives it a strong resemblance to a debt security. Ana-\\nlysts are not fooled; for their purpose, preference shares are reclassified as debt.\\nAgainst these advantages, preference shares also present several drawbacks:\\n1. They cost more than a traditional capital increase: the preference dividend is higher \\nthan the ordinary dividend, whereas the preference share itself is usually worth less \\nthan the ordinary share because of its lesser liquidity.\\n2. Their issuance entails complications that are avoided with an ordinary capital \\nincrease, such as calling a special shareholders’ meeting.\\n3. Furthermore, understanding such issues can be quite difficult. Preference shares \\nfrequently trade at a steep discount to theoretical value because holders demand a \\nbig premium over market value before they will sell or exchange them.'),\n",

When this is true, a capital increase can be accomplished without diluting \\ntheir control of the company. A company with family shareholders may issue preference \\nshares in order to attract outside financial investors without putting the family’s power \\nover the company in jeopardy.\\nBut this advantage brings with it an additional cost for current shareholders and so \\nappears to us quite illusory over the long term. It is just as if the company’s cost of equity \\nhad been raised.\\nToday this product has virtually disappeared from stock markets, which prefer to see \\na single quoted share class for each company traded in substantial volume. These securi-\\nties cease to exist either when the issuing company is taken over by another or when it \\noffers to exchange the priority dividend shares for ordinary shares.\\nOn the other hand, preference shares remain useful as a vehicle for financial invest-\\nments in unlisted companies (particularly in LBOs) or in cross-border business com-\\nbinations as a means of equalising dividend flows between different shareholders in \\ndual-listed companies, as in the case of BHP Billiton, for example.\\nSection 24.4\\nOTHER HYBRID SECURITIES\\nFinancial innovation has reduced the difference between the investment characteristics of \\ndebt and equity. Firms are able to issue securities that function very much like equity but \\nwhich are frequently treated as debt for tax purposes. Much of this innovation represents \\n“equity in drag” (Bulow et al., 1990). Innovation has, in fact, eroded each of the tradi-\\ntional tests used for distinguishing debt and equity.\\n1/ DEEPLY SUBORDINATED DEBT\\nThese instruments have no duration because there is no contractual undertaking for \\nrepayment, which may take place when the issuer so wishes. Note that if the issuer is \\nliquidated, holders rank for repayment after other creditors  (as they are subordi-\\nnated loans) but before shareholders.\\nThese financial instruments present the following four features:\\n1. Permanency: the instrument must be perpetual, and early redemption features \\nmust be under the sole control of the issuer.\\n2. Ranking: in case of liquidation, the securities must rank senior only to share \\ncapital.\\n3. Conditional payment of interest: under certain conditions, such as non-payment \\nof dividends to shareholders, payment of the coupon/dividend to investors must \\nbe left at the issuer’s entire discretion. Such non-payment must not be consid-\\nered as a default event, but as a cancellation of the remuneration, with no deferred \\nremuneration (non-cumulative coupon). Moreover, should the payment endanger '),\n",

Loss absorption mechanism : the securities must give the issuer the ability, in \\naddition to the non-payment of interest, to absorb potential losses by a reduction of \\nthe nominal value of the securities, in order to pursue its activity.\\nConceptually, these are nothing other than very long-term debt securities, whose extremely \\nsubordinated nature could lead to them being assimilated, from an accounting point of \\nview, to equity, which in our view is wrong. Most of them include a step-up clause push-\\ning up the amount of the coupon five to 10 years after the issue which is an incentive for \\nthe issuer to call this instrument.\\nRating agencies adopt a hybrid treatment by restating these issues in one part debt \\nand one part equity (the equity content). So, for example, Moody’s carries out a precise \\nanalysis of the terms and conditions of the issue (in accordance with a pre-established \\ntable) and classifies the issue in a basket (B, C or D) to which is attached an equity content \\n(25%, 50% or 75%).\\xa0\\n2/ MANDATORY CONVERTIBLES\\nUnlike convertible bonds, for which there is always some risk of non-conversion, mandatory \\nconvertibles are necessarily transformed into equity capital (unless the issuing company \\ngoes bankrupt in the meantime) since the issuer redeems them by delivering shares; no cash \\nchanges hands at redemption.\\nMandatory convertibles are hybrid securities, which automatically convert into a \\npredetermined number of shares dependent on the stock price at the time of conversion. \\nThey are closer to equity than debt because they redeem in shares instead of cash, and \\nprovide little downside protection (just the coupon payments). In addition, mandatory \\nconvertibles are often treated as equity on the balance sheet and regarded as equity by the \\nrating agencies.\\nMandatory convertibles are more established in the US than in Europe. They have \\nemerged primarily as an opportunistic response to uninviting market conditions for direct \\nequity issuance and have helped companies deleverage their balance sheets.\\nMandatory convertibles appeal to investors looking for high yield and capital appre-\\nciation, although they have less downside protection than standard convertible bonds. As \\na result, we see interest from equity funds and outright investors but the main investors are \\nhedge funds because they are able to significantly offset stock exposure.\\nIn view of the ongoing pressure on corporates’ balance sheets and the need to refi-\\nnance upcoming redemptions, it is reasonable to expect further interest in mandatory \\nconvertible securities.\\nThe value of a bond redeemable in shares is the present value of the interest payments \\non it plus the present value of the shares received upon redemption. In pure theory, this is \\nequal to the value of the share increased by the present value of the interest and decreased \\nby the present value of the dividends that will be paid before redemption. The discount \\nrate for the interest is the required rate of return on a risky debt security, while the dis-\\ncount rate for the dividends is the company’s cost of equity.'),\n",

Thus, while a \\nconvertible bond can be exchanged for specified amounts of common stock in the issuing \\nfirm, an exchangeable bond is an issue that can be exchanged for the common stock of a \\ncompany other than the issuer of the bond.\\nAt maturity, two cases are possible. If the price of the underlying shares has risen suf-\\nficiently, holders will exchange their bonds for the shares; the liability associated with the \\nbonds will disappear from the first company’s balance sheet, as will the asset associated \\nwith the shares. If the price has not risen enough, holders will redeem their bonds for cash, \\nand the first company will still have the underlying shares. In neither case will there be \\nany contribution of equity capital. An exchangeable bond is therefore like a collateralised \\nloan with a call option for the holder on securities held in the company’s portfolio.\\nFor the investor, a bond issued by company X that is exchangeable for shares of com-\\npany Y is very close to a convertible bond issued by Y. The only thing separating these two \\nfinancial instruments is the default risk of X versus that of Y.\\nBy way of example, in February 2014 Solidium (a Finnish holding company) issued \\na bond exchangeable for shares in Sampo (for a total of 1.3% of Sampo) in which Solid-\\nium held a stake of about 11.9%. Bonds are exchangeable with shares with a premium \\nof 35% for 4.5 years. This issue raised €350m for the group at an apparent interest rate \\nof 0%. The quid pro quo is obviously twofold: for one thing, Solidium cannot be sure of \\nhaving unloaded a part of its holding in Sampo; for another, if it does succeed in disposing \\nof that stake, it will have let it go at a price below its market value.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nHybrid securities often seem to be equity, but that is not always the case. A convertible bond \\nthat is not converted remains a debt; a bond with attached warrants is, likewise, still a debt.\\nMany of these hybrids give the impression of lowering the company’s cost of ﬁnancing. Do \\nnot believe it! In markets in equilibrium, all sources of ﬁnancing have the same cost when \\nadjusted for the risk taken by the investor.

Signalling theory sees in them the mark of an undervalued, heavily \\nindebted company that is unwilling to ﬁnance itself through a traditional capital increase.\\nA convertible bond is like a traditional bond, generally one bearing a ﬁxed rate, except that \\nit also gives the holder the right to exchange it for one or more shares (depending on the \\nconversion ratio) of the issuing company during a conversion period set in advance. Its value \\nis analysed as the sum of the value of the traditional bond and the value of a call option on \\nthe shares with an exercise price equal to the conversion price.\\nConvertible bonds are issued at lower coupon rates than traditional bonds. This is not an \\nadvantage for the issuing company but merely the compensation for the call option it has \\ngranted the investor “at no charge” .\\nA subscription warrant is a security that allows the holder to subscribe during a given period, \\nin a proportion and at a price ﬁxed in advance, to another security. A subscription warrant may \\nbe attached to an issue of shares or bonds or distributed by itself “at no charge” . Conceptually, \\na warrant is a form of call option sold by the company on shares to be issued.

Bank finance was beautiful in its simplicity – whenever \\na company needed funds, it turned to its bank. Now that direct financing has become more \\ncommon, companies can raise funds from a great many investors whom it does not neces-\\nsarily know. That means they have to market their financing!\\nSection 25.1\\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES IN THE SALE OF SECURITIES\\n1/ THE PURPOSE OF OFFERINGS\\nThe company’s main goal in selling its securities to investors is to obtain the highest \\npossible price.\\nFor the sale to be successful, the company must offer investors a return or a potential \\ncapital gain. Otherwise, it will be harder to gain access to the market in the future.\\nThe offering must be in line with this objective. The price of a security is equal to its pres-\\nent value, as long as all publicly available information has been priced in. This is the very \\nbasis of market efficiency. Conversely, asymmetric information is the main factor that can \\nkeep a company from selling an asset at its fair value.\\nInvestors must therefore be given the information they need to make an investment \\ndecision. The company issuing securities and the bank(s) handling the offerings must \\nprovide investors with information. Depending on the type of offering, this can be in the \\nform of:\\nta mandatory legal written document called a prospectus;\\nt presentations by management via meetings/conference calls with investors or \\nelectronic roadshows;\\nt valuations and comments by financial professionals on the deal and the issuer via \\nnotes by financial analysts and presentations to the bank’s sales teams, for example.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 462}, page_content='Chapter 25 SELLING SECURITIES 447\\nSECTION 2\\nc25.indd 12:41:34:PM  09/05/2014 Page 447Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\nA firm underwriting commitment by the bank(s) handling the transaction can provide \\nadditional reassurance to investors, because if the bank is willing to arrange and under-\\nwrite the offering, it must believe that the offering will succeed and that the price is “fair”. \\nAfter all, investors are also clients to whom the bank regularly offers shares.\\nIn any offering the bank’s exact positioning is always ambiguous. In theory it is man-\\ndated by the company that is issuing the securities and must therefore defend that \\ncompany’s interests to the fullest. But to do so, it must persuade the investors, who are \\nits regular customers, to subscribe. It cannot afford to lead its clients astray. Ultimately, \\nit defends the interests of both sides, not to mention its own!\\nInvestor information needs and the complexity of the deal depend on the following:\\ntThe amount of information that is already available on the issuing company \\nitself. Clearly, an initial public offering of shares in a company unknown to the mar-\\nket will require a big effort to educate investors on the company’s strategy, business, \\nfinancial profile and perhaps even the sector in which it operates. This information \\nis already contained in the share price of a publicly traded company, as that price \\nreflects investor anticipation. This is why it is generally easier to offer shares in a \\ncompany that is already listed.\\nt Investor risk. Investors need more information for shares than for bonds, which are \\nless risky.\\nt The type and number of investors targeted. In addition to regulatory restrictions, it \\nis generally more difficult for a European company to sell its securities in the US than \\nin Europe, especially if the company and its industry are not known outside its home \\ncountry (sometimes the opposite can occur, as in the oil services sector, for example). \\nMeanwhile, a private placement with a few investors is simpler than a public offering.\\n2/ THE ROLE OF BANKS\\nThe bank(s) in charge of an offering have four roles, the complexity of which depends on \\nthe type of offering:\\n1. Arranging the deal , i.e. choosing the type of offering on the basis of the goal \\nsought: volume of securities to offer and in what form and timetable, choosing the \\nmarket for the offering, contacts with market authorities, preparation of legal docu-\\nments in liaison with specialised attorneys.\\n2. Circulation of information : an offering is often an opportunity for an issuer to \\nreport on its recent activity, prospects and strategy. The consistency of this infor-\\nmation is checked by the bank and the lawyers in charge of the deal during a phase \\ncalled “due diligence”, which consists of interviews with the company’s manage-\\nment. Information is also gathered by the brokerage arm of the bank and then put \\nout in research notes written by the bank’s financial analysts. The bank also organ-\\nises meetings between the issuer and investors in one or more markets (roadshows \\nor one-to-one meetings).\\n3. Distribution of the paper : the bank’s sales teams approach their regular clients, \\nthe investors, to market the securities and take orders. The issue price is then set by '),\n",

An equilibrium price is established in the “after-market” phase. In the days \\nafter that, the bank may intervene in the market in order to facilitate exchanges of \\nblocks among investors.\\n4. Underwriting : in some cases the bank provides the issuer (or seller) with a guaran-\\ntee that the securities will find buyers at the agreed price. The bank thus assumes a \\ncertain market risk. The magnitude of this risk will depend on the type of guarantee \\nand on the timing of the commitment.\\nMost offerings, especially public offerings,1 require a syndicate made up of several banks. \\nDepending on how involved it is in the deal, and in particular the degree of guarantee, any \\none bank may play the role of:\\ntglobal coordinator, who coordinates all aspects of an offering; the global coordi-\\nnator is also lead manager and usually serve as lead and book-runner as well. For \\nfixed-income issues, the global coordinator is called the arranger;\\nt the lead manager is responsible for preparing and executing the deal. The lead helps \\nchoose the syndicate. One (or more) leads also serve as book-runners. The lead also \\ntakes part in allocating the securities to investors;\\nt joint-leads play an important role, but do not usually serve as book-runners;\\nt co-leads underwrite a significant portion of the securities but have no role in structur-\\ning the deal;\\nt co-managers play a more limited role in the transaction, normally just underwriting \\na small portion of securities.\\nFor some transactions (a block trade of already existing shares or a bond issue), the banks \\nmay buy the securities from the seller (or issuer) and then sell them to investors. This is \\ncalled a bought deal. Unsold securities go onto the bank’s balance sheet.\\nA firm underwriting agreement carries less of a commitment than a bought deal. A \\nfirm underwriting is a commitment by the bank to buy the securities only if the offering \\nfails to attract sufficient investor interest. In some cases, the bank may be released from \\nits commitment in the event of force majeure.\\nBefore agreeing to underwrite more complex deals, banks may wish to have some \\nidea of investors’ intentions. They do so via a process called book-building, which occurs \\nat the same time that information is sent out and the securities are marketed. V olumes and \\nprices from potential investors are listed in the book. This helps determine if the transac-\\ntion is feasible and, if so, at what price. Only after the book-building process do banks \\nchoose whether or not to underwrite the deal. Book-building allows the banks running \\nthe transaction to limit their risk, by assuring them that investors are willing to buy the \\nsecurities.\\nBook-building helps to determine, at a given moment, the best price for the seller \\nand/or company and to allocate the securities on a more or less discretionary basis.\\nIn simpler transactions such as the placement of blocks or the issue of convertible bonds, \\nthe bank will almost always get feedback from a limited number of investors on their \\ninterest in the transaction and on the pricing.\\nIn some cases, the bank does not pledge that the transaction will go through suc-\\ncessfully, only that it will make its best efforts to ensure that this happens. This is rare in \\n1  That is, for \\na flotation on a \\nregulated market \\nor a public retail \\noffer.'),\n",

As a result, best efforts is the rule only in offerings by \\nsmaller companies or in very special cases (companies in financial distress, for example).\\nIn some transactions, the bank’s commitment is halfway between an initial bought \\ndeal and a post-book-building bought deal. When a block of existing shares is being sold, \\na bank may make a “back-stop” or floor underwriting commitment, i.e. go through the \\nbook-building process but guarantee the seller a minimum price.\\nThere are three techniques for adjusting the offering to anticipation of investor behav-\\niour, as well as to their actual behaviour: extension clause, greenshoe and clawback.\\nThe extension clause allows shareholders wanting to sell shares or the company issu-\\ning new shares to sell more shares than initially planned if demand turns out to be strong. \\nThe option is disclosed in the prospectus and can be exercised at the time of the allocation. \\nThe size of the transaction can be increased by 15% in the case of a share issue and 25% \\nin the case of a secondary placement.\\nTo stabilise the price after the transaction, the issuer or seller may give the bank the \\noption of buying a number of shares over and above the shares offered to investors (as \\nmany as 15% more in a capital increase and 25% more for block trades of existing shares). \\nThis is called a greenshoe (named after the first company to use it). The bank allocates \\nall the securities to investors, including the greenshoe shares, i.e. more than the official \\noffering. These additional shares are borrowed by the bank:\\ntIf the price falls after the offering, the bank buys shares on the market up to the limit \\nof the greenshoe. This supports the price. It then has 30 days to resell these shares \\nif the price moves back up. If the price doesn’t rise, the bank repays the loan using \\nthe shares it bought to support the price. In this case the greenshoe is not exercised.\\nt If the price moves up, the bank can resell the shares or, if the price rises immediately \\nafter the transaction, the bank no longer has the shares so it will pay back the loan by \\nexercising the greenshoe. The company will thus have sold more shares than origi-\\nnally planned.\\nGreenshoes are used for secondary offerings (i.e. sale of existing shares), new share issues \\n(the lead bank receives, free of charge, warrants that it may or may not exercise) or con-\\nvertible bond issues (when it takes the form of a simple extension of the issue, decided \\ntwo or three days after its launch).\\nAn offering targeted at several categories of investors (institutional, retail, employ-\\nees, etc.) will be split into several tranches reserved for each of them. The clawback\\nclause gives the company some flexibility in the size of each tranche. Hence, if institu-\\ntional demand is very heavy and retail demand very light, the clawback allows the shares \\ninitially allocated to retail investors to be reallocated to institutional investors.\\nIf a large shareholder sells part of his shares through the transaction, the placement \\nwill be eased if this shareholder commits not to sell additional shares over a certain period \\nof time (unless the bank coordinating the transaction gives the green light). This is called \\nalock up and lasts between a few months and a year.\\nTo simplify the transaction, the bank may advise the company to target a limited \\nnumber of investors, thus avoiding the rules governing a public offering, including super-\\nvision by market authorities, obligation to present information, etc. This is called a pri-\\nvate placement and is possible on all types of products. Private placements are often used \\nin offerings to US investors (generally under rule 144A), as the offering would otherwise \\nbe subject to extremely strict restrictions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 465}, page_content='FINANCIAL SECURITIES450\\nSECTION 2\\nc25.indd 12:41:34:PM  09/05/2014 Page 450Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\n3/ ISSUE DISCOUNTS\\nStudies show that when a company is floated, its stock normally rises by an average of \\nabout 10–15% over its issue price, depending on the country, the timing and how the rise \\nis calculated. Meanwhile, shares in a company that is already listed are usually offered at \\na discount ranging from 2–5% although the range varies profoundly according to differ-\\nent countries.\\nThis discount is theoretically due to the asymmetry of information between the seller \\nand the investors or intermediaries. One side knows more about the company’s prospects, \\nwhile the other side knows more about market demand. The transaction is therefore pos-\\nsible. It’s all a matter of price! Selling securities generally sends out a negative signal, so \\nthe seller has to price his securities slightly below their true value to ensure the deal goes \\nthrough and that investors are satisfied.\\nThe IPO discount could be due to the fact that there are both informed and unin-\\nformed investors. Uninformed investors cannot distinguish which issues are really attrac-\\ntive and thus are exposed to the winner’s curse. This is why an average discount is offered, \\nto guarantee an appropriate return for uninformed investors who will be receiving many \\nshares of a “bad deal” and few shares of a “good deal”. Others suggest that the discount \\nis a way of remunerating the banks underwriting the deal. The discount makes the issue \\neasier to market, reduces their risk and allows them to meet institutional client demand.\\nThe issue discount is another way to persuade investors to invest in a transaction \\nthat appears to carry some risk.\\nThe greater the asymmetry in information between an issuer and investors, and the \\nlower the liquidity of the security, the greater is the issue discount. The issue discount \\nwill thus be high for an initial public offering, less for the sale of shares in an already \\nlisted company, low or non-existent for convertible bonds and totally absent for bonds.\\nSo much for the major principles. Let’s now look at how the main types of securities are \\noffered. As you will see, the methods converge towards two main techniques: bought \\ndeals and book-building.\\nSection 25.2\\nINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS\\nThe purpose of this section is not to analyse the motivations, strategic or otherwise, of an \\ninitial public offering (IPO) but simply to describe how it works.\\n1/ HOW AN IPO WORKS\\nIPOs are surely the most complex of transactions. They involve selling securities, about \\nwhich prior information is extremely limited, to a large number of investors, including \\ninstitutional and retail investors and employees.\\nAn IPO can include a primary tranche (i.e. shares newly issued by the company) and/\\nor a secondary tranche (i.e. existing shares). The techniques are the same for both tranches '),\n",

However, in the past few years, IPOs \\non regulated markets have almost all been in the same form: that of an underwritten deal\\nwith institutional investors and a retail public offering with retail investors.\\n(a) Book-building\\nOfferings of securities to institutional investors are most often implemented through a \\nbook-building. This is the main tranche in almost all IPOs. Under this system, one or \\nmore banks organise the marketing and sale of securities to investors via a phase of book-\\nbuilding. The price set after book-building will serve as a basis for setting the price of the \\nretail public offering. Other techniques are used for the other tranches (employees and \\nretail investors, in particular).\\nThe initial review phase  is handled by the banks. This consists of assessing \\nand preparing the legal and regulatory framework of the deal (choice of market for \\nlisting, whether to offer shares in the US, etc.); structuring the deal; supervising documen-\\ntation (due diligence, prospectus) and underwriting and execution agreements; preparing \\nfinancial analysis reports; designing a marketing campaign (i.e. the type and content of \\nmanagement presentations, programme of meetings between management and investors).\\nThen comes the execution phase , with the publishing of financial analysis \\nnotes by syndicate banks. This is a pre-marketing period lasting one to two weeks \\nprior to the effective launch of the operation. The notes are presented to investors dur-\\ning “warm-up” meetings, which help test investor sentiment. Analysts’ research notes \\ncannot be published during the blackout period that precedes the launch. The terms of \\nthe transaction, particularly the price range, are set on the basis of conclusions from this \\npre-marketing exercise.\\nThe marketing campaign itself then begins, and the offering is under way. During \\nthis period, full information is distributed via draft prospectuses (certified by market \\nauthorities), which may be national or international in scope. The prospectus includes all \\ninformation on the company and the transaction. The offering is marketed within a price \\nrange of about 15%. Company managers are mobilised during this period for numerous \\nmeetings with investors (roadshows) or for one-on-one meetings. The information given \\nto investors is mainly on company results, markets and strategy.\\nIn the meantime, investor intentions to subscribe in terms of volumes and prices are \\nrecorded in an order book, on the basis of the preliminary price range.\\nAfter this period, which can last five to 15 days, the sale price of the existing shares \\nand/or newly issued shares is set. The price reflects market conditions, overall demand \\nas reflected in the order book and the price sensitivity that investors may have expressed.'),\n",

The \\nshares are then immediately allocated, thus limiting the bank’s risk. After allocation, \\ninvestors are theoretically committed. However, up to the actual settlement and delivery \\nof the shares (three days after the transaction), banks still face counterparty risk. There \\nis also business risk in the form of an institutional investor who decides he does not wish \\nto take delivery of the shares after all. In sum, the only risks the syndicate takes is that \\nof a market crash between the moment the price is set and the moment when the shares \\nare allocated, and that of stabilising the price for around a month after the transaction by \\nbuying shares on the market.\\nThe guarantee given by the bank to the company is also implicitly a guarantee for \\nthe market. The bank determines a value after review of internal information. This partly \\nresolves the problem of asymmetry of information. The signal is no longer negative, \\nbecause a bank with access to internal information is taking the risk of buying the shares \\nat a set price if the market does not.\\nThe final prospectus (with the issue price) is sent out after the price is set and the sub-\\nscription period is closed. The lead bank knows the quantity and quality of demand. The \\nbook-runner allocates the new shares to investors in concert with the issuer and/or seller, \\nwho can thus “choose” his shareholders to a certain extent.\\nThe shares are allocated on the basis of certain criteria determined in advance. \\nAllocation is discretionary but not arbitrary. The goal may be to favour US, European \\nor local investors. Generally, the main goal in allocation is to have a balance between \\ninvestors with different investment timing in order to ensure a stable aftermarket. \\nThe banks may steer the issuer to what it believes are quality investors, thus lim-\\niting excessive flowback, i.e. the massive sale of securities immediately after \\nthe offering.\\nIn academic research, discretionary allocation and pricing have been interpreted in \\nthe following ways:\\ntBenveniste and Spindt (1989) claim that the most knowledgeable investors reveal the \\ninformation they have (through their order in the order book) in exchange for a good \\nallocation and good pricing (IPO discount).\\nt In a second interpretation, the bank tries to favour long-term investors in order not to \\ndrive down the share price in the short term. In addition, the IPOed firm may wish to \\ncreate a long-term shareholder base.\\nt In a third interpretation, the bank will use its power in the transaction to maximise its \\nprofits (which is sometimes against the interest of the firm being IPOed). The bank \\nderives high profits from its large institutional clients (in particular thanks to trading \\nrevenues). They will, therefore, favour them in the primary transactions in granting \\nlarge allocations and driving the pricing down. Such behaviour has sometimes been \\nsanctioned by law.\\nBook-building offers several advantages, including greater flexibility. For one thing, the \\nprice can be adjusted as necessary during the marketing phase, which can sometimes last \\nseveral weeks. Moreover, shareholders can still be chosen via discretionary allocation of \\nshares.'),\n",

However, when shares are being \\nsold to retail investors, the issue is centralised by the market itself.\\n t The retail public offering\\nIn a retail public offering, a price range is set before the offering, but the exact price is \\nset after the offering. The final price reflects market demand. French market authori-\\nties, for example, require a marketing period lasting at least three days, after which a \\ndraft prospectus is issued with the characteristics of the deal. Based on a price range, \\nfinancial intermediaries collect orders from investors. The issue price is set jointly \\nby the issuer and the syndicate lead and is generally equal to the underwriting price.2 \\nThe final prospectus is then approved by the market authorities.\\nWith the agreement of the market authorities, the banks can adjust the price if they \\nhave previously reserved the right to do so but, in general, they must begin the pro-\\ncess anew if the new price is outside of the initial range. Shares are allocated on the \\nbasis of orders if supply is equivalent to demand and can be reduced on the basis of \\npredetermined criteria. Allocation of shares to the various categories of buyers is \\ndone on the same basis as the fixed-price offer.\\n2 Retail \\ninvestors are \\ngenerally offered \\na discount or \\nare exempt from \\ncertain fees.'),\n",

Normally, at least 1% of the order is filled, but there may be provision \\nfor a minimum number of shares per order, so that broker fees do not end up swal-\\nlowing any potential gain. Similarly, there are sometimes several categories of orders \\nwith different allocation priorities.\\nt Fixed-price offering\\nUnder a fixed-price offering, a certain number of shares are offered to the public at a \\npreset price, which is generally identical to the price offered to institutional investors. \\nThe price is set after the book-building phase and is independent of market condi-\\ntions. It is applied regardless of the number of shares requested. If it is far below what \\nthe market is willing to pay, the price will rise sharply in the days after the IPO and \\nprimary market buyers will have a capital gain to show for their initiative.\\nThe only difference between a fixed-price offering and a retail public offering is how \\nthe price is set.\\nt Minimum-price offering\\nUnder this technique, a number of shares are offered to the public at a certain price, \\nunder which they will not be sold. The local stock exchange centralises orders, in \\nwhich buyers must specify a floor price, and tries to find a sufficiently wide price \\nrange at which orders can be allocated in a certain proportion (about 6%) if there is \\nsufficient demand.\\nIn a minimum-price offering, some orders may be shut out entirely, and orders at \\nvery high prices are paradoxically eliminated. This explains why the first quoted \\nprice is above the pre-set minimum price. If demand is too strong to quote the shares, \\ntrading is declared “limit up” and resumes at a higher price, or another technique is \\nused for the initial quotation.\\nt An ordinary full listing\\nThe principle of an ordinary full listing is simple: the shares are offered on the basis \\nof the market’s normal trading and quoting conditions. A minimum sale price is set, \\nbut buy orders are not centralised by the local stock exchange. Quotation is possible \\nat a price normally no higher than 110% of the minimum price; at least 6% of the buy \\norders are filled (4% in exceptional cases). As in a minimum-price offering, trading \\nmay be suspended “limit up” and resumed at a higher price. In addition, orders may \\nhave to be covered by sufficient funds (the goal being to discourage speculation).\\n3/ US LISTINGS FOR NON -US COMPANIES\\nCompanies normally list their shares on their domestic stock market, where they are bet-\\nter known. However, they may wish to tap foreign investors to widen their shareholder \\nbase and could thus seek a foreign listing.\\nThis decision is not so unusual – over 3000 foreign companies are listed in the US!\\nSince the American markets (NYSE and Nasdaq) are traditionally the preferred alter-\\nnative for companies wanting to list, we focus our attention on US listing.\\nA company can list its shares on the US market via (1) a private placement, (2) American \\nDepositary Receipts or (3) a full listing.'),\n",

QIBs are then prohibited \\nfrom selling their shares on the open market for two years, but can trade with other QIBs \\nvia the PORTAL system. Private placements are simply a means of gaining access to US \\ninvestors, but do not allow a company to register its shares with the Securities Exchange \\nCommission (SEC) or to quote them in the US.\\nThis is the least restrictive way to raise capital on US markets, as private placements \\nare not registered with the SEC and come under the 12g3-2(b) waiver. All the issuing \\ncompany has to do is translate the information that it has provided to its domestic market.\\n(b) Indirect listing via American Depositary Receipt (ADR)\\nADRs, also known as DRs or GDRs, 3 are negotiable instruments issued by a US bank \\nand representing the shares that it has acquired in a foreign company listed on a non-US \\nmarket – something like tracking stocks, except they are not issued by the company itself. \\nADRs are traded on a regulated market or an over-the-counter (OTC) market.\\nThe ADR shares can be established either for existing shares already trading in the \\nsecondary market of the home country, or as part of a global offering of new shares.\\nThere are several types of ADR: \\nt Level 1 ADRs are not traded on an organised market but only over the counter. They \\ndo not allow companies to raise funds on the US market, but nor do they require any \\nparticular information to be put out.\\nt Level 2 ADRs are listed on an organised market. This attracts some US pension \\nfunds, but requires the companies to publish a 20-F report every year. The 20-F is \\na more extensive document than a typical European annual report (it includes, for \\nexample, a table for converting from the company’s accounting principles to US \\nGAAP4). Companies are not allowed to raise funds with Level 2 ADRs.\\nt Level 3 ADRs provide the company with a listing (via its ADR) on an organised \\nmarket, and also allow it to raise funds via a public offering. Level 3 accordingly \\nrequires full registration with the SEC (F-1). Moreover, the company is subject to \\nstrict obligations on information (based on the 20-F and 6-K). Among other things, \\nthe published documents must list plans for acquisitions or reorganisation, as well as \\na partial reconciliation of company accounts to US GAAP. Companies usually go this \\nroute when they have significant commercial interests in North America.\\nMore than 3000 ADRs are listed from 50 different countries, including Alcatel-Lucent,\\nTelefónica, Korea Electric Power, Nokia, BP and many others.\\n(c)Full listing\\nCompanies can also list their ordinary shares in both their home countries and directly in \\nthe US. This gives them access to institutional investors whose by-laws do not allow them \\nto buy shares outside the US.\\nThe main difference between ordinary registered shares and ADRs is that \\nordinary registered shares carry lower transaction costs as there is no depositary. \\nThey are also more liquid and are less subject to arbitrage trading between domestic \\nshares and ADRs.\\n3  American \\nDepositary\\nReceipts may \\nbe also called \\n– generically \\n– Depositary \\nReceipts (DRs), \\nor Rule 144A \\nDepositary\\nReceipts or \\nGlobal Deposi-\\ntary Receipts \\n(GDRs), which \\nare the “private \\nplacement” dis-\\ncussed in the text. \\nHowever, differ-\\nent names typi-\\ncally identify the \\nmarket in which \\nthe Depositary \\nReceipts are \\navailable:ADRs\\nare publicly \\navailable to US \\ninvestors on a \\nnational stock \\nexchange or in \\nthe over-the-\\ncounter market; \\nRule 144A ADRs\\nare privately \\nplaced and resold \\nonly to Qualified \\nInstitutional Buy-\\ners (QIBs) in the \\nUS QIB PORTAL \\nmarket; and \\nGDRs are gener-\\nally available \\nin one or more \\nmarkets outside \\nthe foreign \\ncompany’s home \\ncountry, although \\nthese may also be \\nknown as ADRs.\\n4 Companies \\nfollowing the \\nIFRS norms will \\nno longer be \\nobliged to abide \\nby this rule after \\n2009.'),\n",

The issue price of the new shares is set and announced in advance and the offer-\\ning then unfolds over several days. The price is set at a significant discount to the \\nmarket price, so that the transaction will go through even if the share price drops in \\nthe run up to the listing of new shares. To avoid penalising existing shareholders, the \\nissue comes with pre-emptive subscription rights, which are negotiable throughout the \\ntransaction period.\\nHowever, when current shareholders are not expected to subscribe or when the com-\\npany wants to widen its shareholder base, no pre-emptive subscription rights are issued. \\nThe issue price is then not set until a marketing and pre-placement period has been com-\\npleted, with a very slight discount to the share price at the end of this period. There are \\nno pre-emptive subscription rights, but there may be a period during which current share-\\nholders are given priority in subscribing.\\n(b)Unlisted companies\\nIn this case, the issue price’s discount will not be dictated by the fear that the share price \\nwill fluctuate during the operation (as the company is not listed), but rather by the wish \\nof current shareholders to raise cash by selling the subscription rights they may have \\nreceived.\\nIf current shareholders do not wish to raise cash, the company will issue pre-emptive \\nsubscription rights at a price about equal to the share price, or may issue shares to iden-\\ntified investors that have been found via a private placement.5 Shares cannot be issued \\nbelow par value (this is also the case for listed companies). If the share price is below par \\nvalue, the par value could be reduced by offsetting it against past losses.\\n5  In the rare \\ncase of a capital \\nincrease with \\nno subscription \\nrights and not \\nreserved for iden-\\ntified investors, \\nthe price is based \\non an expert \\nappraisal or is \\nset at book value.'),\n",

Such issues acknowledge their loyalty or, conversely, allow them to raise \\na little cash by selling their subscription rights.\\nIn some countries, such as the United States and Japan, rights issues are quite rare, \\nwhile in Continental Europe they generally have to be sold by rights.\\nSuch issues remain open for at least 10 trading days. Banks underwrite them at a \\nprice well below the current share price, generally at a discount of 15–30%. No bank \\nwill guarantee a price near the current market price because, the longer the subscription \\nperiod, the greater the risk of a drop in price. It is at this price that the banks will buy up \\nany shares that have not found takers.\\nA steep discount would be a considerable injustice to existing shareholders, as the \\nnew shareholders could buy shares at 20% below the current market price. Rights issues \\nresolve this problem by allowing existing shareholders to buy a number of shares propor-\\ntional to the number they already have. If existing shareholders use all their pre-emptive \\nrights, i.e. buy the same proportion of new shares as they possess of existing shares, they \\nshould not care what price the new shares are offered at.\\nThe price of the new shares plus the value of the pre-emptive subscription rights is \\nequivalent to the stock’s current market value (i.e. its share price if it is listed), even if \\nthe price of the new shares is below the current share price.\\nWHICH METHOD SHOULD BE USED FOR A CAPITAL INCREASE?\\nRights issue \\nsubscribed\\nmainly by:\\nListed company Unlisted company\\nCurrent shareholders Pre-emptive \\nsubscription rights \\nSteep discount to the market \\nprice\\nPre-emptive subscription \\nrights with a steep discount \\nif current shareholders wish to \\nraise cash\\nPre-emptive subscription rights \\nwith no discount or no \\npre-emptive rights if current \\nshareholders do not want to \\nraise cash\\nNew shareholders Offer without pre-emptive \\nsubscription rights \\n(at a slight discount to the \\ncurrent share price)\\nIn some cases, a reserved \\nrights issue\\nPre-emptive subscription rights \\nwith a steep discount if \\nshareholders want to raise cash \\nReserved rights issue if \\nshareholders do not want cash'),\n",

This negotiable right adjusts the issue price to the current \\nshare price.\\nThe subscription right is similar to a call option whose underlying is the share, whose \\nstrike price is the issue price of the new shares and whose exercise period is that of the \\ncapital increase. Hence, its theoretical value is similar to that of a call option whose time \\nvalue is very low, given its short maturity.\\nIf the issue price and the current share price are the same, the subscription right’s \\nmarket value will be zero and its only value will be the priority it grants.\\nIf the share price falls below the issue price, the rights issue will fail, as nobody will \\nbuy a share at more than its market price. The right then loses all value. Fortunately, the \\nreverse occurs more frequently.\\n(b) Calculating the theoretical value of the subscription right\\nLet’s take a company that has 1 000 000 shares outstanding, trading at €50 each. The \\ncompany issues 100 000 new shares at €40 each, or one new share for each 10 existing \\nones. Each existing share will have one subscription right, and to buy a new share for €40, \\n10 subscription rights and €40 will be required.\\nAfter the new shares have been issued, an existing shareholder who holds one share \\nand has sold his pre-emptive subscription rights must be in the same situation as an inves-\\ntor who has bought 10 pre-emptive subscription rights and one new share. So the share \\nprice after the deal should be equal to: \\nPre-deal price 1 pre-emptive right−\\nbut also\\nIssue price 10 pre-emptive subscription rights+\\nIn our example:\\n€50 − 1 subscription right = €40 + 10 subscription rights\\nHence\\nThe value of the right = €0.91'),\n",

Hence, the existing shareholder may, if he wishes, sell some pre-emptive rights \\nand use the cash and remaining rights to subscribe to new shares, without laying out new \\ncash (see the exercise at the end of this chapter).\\nThe theoretical value of the share, once the rights have been distributed, is equal to \\nthe price pre transaction less the value of the right. It is called the theoretical ex-right \\nprice or TERP.\\n(c) Advantages and drawbacks of pre-emptive rights\\nThe subscription right is valid for at least 10 days – a relatively lengthy amount of time. \\nThe issue price therefore has to be well below the share price, so that if the share price \\ndoes fall during the period, the deal can still go through. The value of the right (i.e. the \\ndifference between the share price and the issue price) will fall but will remain positive, \\nas long as the share price, ex-rights, is above the issue price.\\nThis is a double-edged sword as, once the deal is launched and the rights issued, \\nnothing can delay the capital increase, even if the share price drops significantly during \\nthe deal. This is why the initial discount is so significant.\\nComplicating the transaction further is the fact that shareholders who do not possess \\na number of shares divisible by the subscription parity must sell or buy rights on the mar-\\nket so that they do. This can be difficult to do on international markets.\\nAnother potential complication is the large proportion of US investors among current \\nshareholders who are sometimes unable to exercise their pre-emptive subscription rights.\\n3/ ISSUE  OF SHARES  WITHOUT  PRE -EMPTIVE  SUBSCRIPTION  RIGHTS\\nIn issues of shares without subscription rights, the company also turns to a bank or a \\nbanking syndicate for the issue. But their role is more important in this case, as they must \\nmarket the new shares to new investors. They generally underwrite the issue, as described \\nabove for IPOs. A retail public offering can be undertaken simultaneously. Alternatively, \\nthe bank can simply launch the transaction and centralise the orders without having \\ngone through a book-building phase. The company may issue 10–15% more shares than \\nexpected, via a greenshoe, under which warrants are issued to the banks (see above).\\nLocal regulations tend to limit the flexibility to issue shares without subscription \\nrights so that the shareholder will not be diluted at an absurd price. Therefore, in most '),\n",

Indeed, such a priority \\nperiod is the rule when pre-emptive rights are not issued. However, unlike pre-emptive \\nrights, the priority period cannot be bought or sold. However, priority periods have the \\ndisadvantage of lengthening the total transaction period, as they generally last a few trad-\\ning days (this is the minimum amount of time to allow individual shareholders the time \\nto subscribe).\\nLegally speaking, a public issue of new shares, with or without pre-emptive rights, \\nis considered to have been completed when the banks have signed a contract on a firm \\nunderwriting of the transaction, regardless of whether or not the shares end up being fully \\nsubscribed.\\nSuch issues of shares can be implemented in the form of a private placement to quali-\\nfied investors (usually for a minor portion of capital). \\n4/ EQUITY LINES\\nThe way an equity line works is that a company issues warrants to a bank which exercises \\nthem at the request of the company when it needs to raise equity. Equity lines smooth the \\nimpact of a capital increase over time. The shares issued when the warrants are exercised \\nare immediately resold by the bank.\\nEquity lines are suitable for young businesses where the stock performance history \\ndoes not allow conventional rights issues. However, it opens the way to many uncertain-\\nties, particularly on the terms imposed on the banks in exercising warrants and reselling \\nthe shares.\\nSection 25.4\\nBLOCK TRADES OF SHARES\\nA block is a large number of shares that a shareholder wishes to sell on the market. Nor-\\nmally, only a small fraction of a company’s shares are traded during the course of a nor-\\nmal day. Hence, a shareholder who wants to sell, for example, 5% of a company’s shares \\ncannot do so directly on the market. If he did, he could only do so over a long period and \\nwith the risk of driving down the share price. Blocks are sold via book-building and/or \\nbought deals, which were described above.\\n1/ BOOK -BUILDING AND ACCELERATED BOOK -BUILDING\\nLike a rights issue, a block trade is done via book-building. However, while rights issues \\nallow companies to raise significant funds for investment, a block trade does not raise any \\nnew capital or have any direct impact on the company’s business.\\nMoreover, fewer shares are usually involved in a block trade than in a capital increase. \\nBlock trades are thus “simpler” deals than capital increases and require less marketing.

Barring a waiver from \\nEuronext, a retail offering is possible only if it involves at least 10% of the total outstand-\\ning shares or at least 20 times the average daily volumes during the previous six months.\\nBlock trades use methods similar to those of IPOs, particularly in price-setting. For \\nexample, prices can be set in advance or on the basis of terms set when the offering \\nbegins. However, in the latter case, no price range is required (but the price-setting mecha-\\nnism and the maximum price must be spelled out). In the requisite filings with Euronext, \\nthe initiator can reserve the right to withdraw the offer if take-up is insufficient or increase \\nthe number of shares on offer by as much as 25% if demand is greater than expected.\\n2/ BOUGHT DEALS AND BACK -STOPS\\nWhen the seller initiates book-building or accelerated book-building, he has no guarantee \\nthat the transaction will go through. Nor does he know at what price the deal will be done. \\nTo solve this problem, he can ask the bank to buy the shares itself. The bank will then sell \\nthem to investors. This is called a “bought deal”.\\nThe bank is then taking a significant risk and will only buy the shares at a discount to \\nthe market price. In recent bought deals involving liquid stocks, this discount has ranged \\nfrom 2% to 5%.\\nThe way it works is this: the seller contacts a few banks one evening after the mar-\\nkets close. He may have mentioned to some banks a few days or weeks beforehand that \\nhe might be selling shares, thus ensuring better-quality replies. The seller asks each bank \\nthe price it is willing to offer for the shares. Bids must be submitted within a few hours. \\nThe seller chooses the bank solely on the basis of price, and the shares are sold that very \\nnight. The bank must then organise its sales teams to resell the shares during the night in \\nNorth America or Asia, taking advantage of the time difference, and then the following \\nmorning in Europe.\\nFor the seller, bought deals offer the advantage of being certain that the deal will go \\nthrough and at the price stated at the moment when it decides whether to sell. There are \\nsome disadvantages, however: \\ntthe deal will generally be at a greater discount than in accelerated book-building;\\nt share performance can suffer, as the bank that has acquired the shares will want to \\nsell them as quickly as possible, even if that means making the price fall;\\nIn a very hot market, the seller may have the best of both worlds in transactions with a \\nback-stop.\\ntThe bank sets up an order book so that the firm can benefit from an increase in share \\nprice.\\nt The bank guarantees a minimum price. If all or part of the placement cannot be made \\nat that price, the bank will buy the shares at the back-stop price.'),\n",

A number of \\nlarge transactions (in particular when governments are sellers) have led to heavy losses \\nfor investment banks in charge.\\nSection 25.5\\nBONDS\\nAs the bond market develops and becomes more international, investors need benchmarks \\nto measure the risk of default by issuers they do not always know very well. Ratings have \\nthus become crucial in bond offerings. Companies that do not have a rating from at least \\none agency are finding it increasingly difficult to issue bonds.\\nAs we mentioned in Chapter 20, the corporate bond market can be separated between \\ncompanies having a rating of at least BBB (investment grade) and companies rated BB \\nor lower (below investment grade). When they want to issue bonds, the latter must offer \\nhigher interest rates. Such bonds are called “high-yield”. The investment grade and high \\nyield markets are separate, not just for the issuers, but also for investors and for the invest-\\nment banks handling the offering.\\n1/ INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS\\nThe euro switchover has naturally given rise to a pan-European bond market, and has \\nallowed much larger issues than were previously possible on national markets. €1bn\\nissues are no longer rare, and only issues of €10bn or more are exceptional.\\nCorporate bonds are generally placed via book-building.\\nBond-offering techniques have thus evolved towards those used for shares, and mar-\\nket regulations have followed suit. For example, competitive bidding  has gradually \\ngiven way to book-building. Competitive bidding consists of a tender from banks. The \\nissuer chooses the establishment that will head up the offering on the basis of the terms \\noffered (mainly price). It thus takes the risk of giving the lead mandate to a bank that is \\noverly aggressive on price. The reason this is risky is that prices of bonds on the second-\\nary market may fall after the operation begins as the bonds were issued at too high a price \\n(hence at an excessively low rate). Buyers will not like this and will demand a higher \\ninterest rate the next time the issuer comes to the primary market. Competitive bidding is \\nsimilar to a bought deal and is often used by state-owned companies, as well as companies \\nthat have already tapped the bond markets.\\nOther placement techniques exist (but they are usually used by sovereign issuers): \\nDutch Auctions (“reverse auctions”) are one example.\\nBook-building helps avoid price weakness after launch, as the issue price (or spread) \\nis not pre-set. The lead bank suggests a price range and sounds out investors to see \\nwhat price they are willing to pay. Presentations to investors, one-on-one meetings and \\nelectronic roadshows over the Internet or Bloomberg allow management to present its \\nstrategy.'),\n",

There is little risk of miscalculation, as the issue price \\nis set by the market. The period between when the price is set and the effective delivery \\nof the shares is called the grey market (this is also the case for IPOs and rights issues). \\nShares are traded on the grey market without, technically, even existing. Transactions on \\nthe grey market are unwound after settlement and delivery and the first official quotations. \\nThe lead intervenes on the grey market to maintain the spread at which the issue has been \\npriced. \\nThis is especially useful when an issue requires, or would benefit from, intense mar-\\nketing. Companies wishing to market investors aggressively (notably to return to the mar-\\nket when they wish), will use book-building.\\nSo there are some similarities between share and bond offerings. However, the pro-\\ncess is much shorter for bonds and can be extremely short, especially if a company is a \\nfrequent issuer, and if the issue is on its local market. The process is longer for a first issue \\nor if the company is targeting a large proportion of international investors.\\nA sample timetable for an issuer who has issued bonds in the past is shown in the \\ndiagram below:\\nChoice\\nof leads\\nNegotiation\\nof mandate\\nTimetable for a bond issue\\n1st week 2 nd week\\nPricing\\n   Book-building\\n(last days\\nof marketing)\\n   Roadshows,\\none-on-ones\\n   Distribution\\nof draft\\nprospectus\\n   Preparation of\\nmarketing\\ncampaign\\n   Preparation of\\ndocumentation\\n+ 2/3 weeks\\nThe role of the lead is not just to market the paper, but to advise the client, where  \\napplicable, in the obtaining of a rating. It determines the spread possible through com-\\nparisons with issuers having a similar profile and chooses the members of the syndicate to \\nhelp sell the bonds to the largest number possible of investors.\\nWhen the company plans several issues in the medium term, it can put out an umbrella \\nprospectus to cover all of them, under an issue of EMTNs (euro medium-term notes). \\nThis allows the company to tap the markets very rapidly when it needs to or when the \\nmarket is attractive.\\nBond issues are usually reserved for qualified investors as issues to individual inves-\\ntors are much more cumbersome in terms of documentation.\\nBond issues can also be limited to a very limited number of investors and will then be \\ncalled a private placement (see Chapter 20).\\n2/ HIGH -YIELD  BONDS\\nThe high-yield bond market has developed in Europe only since the late 1990s.

Investors are \\ngenerally contacted in anticipation of the transaction to gauge their appetite for the trans-\\naction and the type of issuer that they could consider. The transaction is then proposed \\nto firms that meet the criteria defined by the investors. Investors are typically insurance \\ncompanies or pension funds looking for long-term investment and not caring much about \\nthe liquidity of their investment.\\nThe placement requires the drafting of a prospectus (as in a standard transaction) but \\nit will not be widely distributed. This market is accessible to non-rated firms.\\nObviously each local market (US, European, Schuldschein in Germany) has its \\nspecificities.\\nSection 25.6\\nCONVERTIBLE  AND  EXCHANGEABLE  BONDS\\nConvertible and exchangeable bonds are issued via accelerated book-building or bought \\ndeals.\\nConvertible bonds (CBs) (examined in Chapter 24) are a very specific product. They are \\nfirst of all bonds paying interest and redeemed in cash at maturity. They are called con-\\nvertibles, as the investor has the right to ask that the bond be redeemed not in cash but in \\nshares, based on a parity set at issue, if the share price has risen enough by then. Holders \\nof convertible bonds are entitled to all information put out by the issuer to its sharehold-\\ners, while the share price tells them precisely how much the CB’s option component is \\nworth.\\nFrom a placement point of view, the investor of a convertible bond will benefit from \\nall the information given by the firm to the equity market. In addition, the share price \\nallows the investor to value precisely the option part of the instrument that he will buy.\\nBy definition, high-yield, or non-investment grade, bonds are risky products.

However, CBs are now well known to professional investors, and \\nare sold mainly to specialised investors or hedge funds.\\nSection 25.7\\nSYNDICATED LOANS\\nSyndicated loans are not securities in their own right, but merely loans made to companies \\nby several banks. \\nA syndicated loan offering is nonetheless similar to a bond issue. The company first \\nreceives a proposal from different banks to put in place or (refinance) a syndicated loan. On \\nthe basis of these proposals, the firm will retain one (or several) bank(s) that will arrange \\nthe transaction (the Mandated Lead Arrangers or MLAs). This bank may do a bought deal \\nof the entire loan and then syndicate it afterwards. The arranger is paid specifically for its \\nadvisory and placement role. When a large number of MLAs are retained, some will have \\na specific role to coordinate the transaction, and they will act as book-runners.\\nThe main terms are negotiated between the arranger and the company and are put \\ninto a term sheet. Meanwhile, the bank and company choose a syndication strategy along \\nwith the banks (or financial institutions) that will be members of the syndicate.\\nAfter meetings with the company and a memorandum of information is drawn up, the \\nbanks contacted will decide whether or not to take part in the syndicated loan. Once the \\nsyndicate is formed, the legal documentation is finalised. The entire process can take two \\nmonths between the choice of arranger and the delivery of funds.\\nSyndicated loans are closely dependent on the quality of the company’s relationship \\nwith its banks. Syndicated loans do not often make much money for the banks when they \\nare not the arranger, and they take part only as they wish to develop or maintain good rela-\\ntions with a client, to whom they can later market more lucrative transactions. Member-\\nship of a syndicate sometimes even comes with the stipulation that it will be remunerated \\nthrough an implicit or explicit pledge from the company to choose the bank as the lead on \\nits next market transaction or as an advisor on its next M&A deal.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nThe aim of all types of equity offerings is to sell the shares to investors at the highest price \\nat any given time.\\nTo achieve this, the large gap in the quantity and quality of information available to the \\nissuer compared with that available to the investor must be reduced. One of the roles of \\nbanks in equity offerings is to inform investors by passing on information obtained from the \\nissuer. The bank has three other roles: it must structure the deal, distribute the securities \\nand generally provide the issuer with a guarantee at a given level.\\nThere are two main types of equity placements:\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

Following a phase of dissemi-\\nnation of information to investors, investor intentions to subscribe are recorded in an order \\nbook. It is only at this stage that the banks will sign a ﬁrm underwriting agreement, thus \\nlimiting the risk taken. For a bought deal, the banks will buy the securities from the issuer, \\nand it is up to the banks to place the securities with investors as quickly as possible in order \\nto limit the risk.\\nInitial public offerings are very complex transactions and involve the dissemination of appro-\\npriate information to a variety of investors. Two types of offering exist side by side. There is \\nthe underwritten deal, when the banking syndicate places the securities with institutional \\ninvestors on the basis of the orders recorded in the order book. Generally, a retail public \\noffering is made to retail investors at the same time: in a retail public offering, a price \\nrange is set before the offering, but the exact price is set after the offering. The ﬁnal price \\nreﬂects market demand. When the offer to retail investors is a ﬁxed-price offer, the issue \\nprice is pre-set. Generally identical to the price offered to institutional investors, it is totally \\nindependent of the market. Minimum price offerings and full listings using standard market \\nprocedures are rarely used these days.\\nThere are two techniques for carrying out equity issues of companies that are already listed, \\ndepending on how eager existing shareholders are to subscribe to new shares. There is \\nthe ﬁxed-price capital increase with pre-emptive subscription rights, or a capital increase \\nwithout pre-emptive subscription rights but possibly with a period during which existing \\nshareholders are given priority to subscribe.\\nFor the former, the issue price is set at a signiﬁcant discount to the market price. In addition, \\nin order to avoid penalising existing shareholders, the issue comes with pre-emptive sub-\\nscription rights, which are negotiable. Accordingly, the price of the new shares is equivalent \\nto the stock’s current market value even if the price of the new shares is below the current \\nshare price. A pre-emptive subscription right is akin to a call option.\\nA capital increase without a pre-emptive subscription right, for which shareholder approval \\nis required, is an underwritten deal. The issue price is close to the market price. For unlisted \\ncompanies, capital increases are carried out with or without pre-emptive subscription rights, \\nwith deﬁned investors who have been identiﬁed following a private placement.\\nBlock trades and issues of convertible bonds are carried out via book-building (or accelerated \\nbook-building which takes only a few hours) or via a bought deal.\\nThe procedure a company uses to issue bonds depends ﬁrst and foremost on the company’s \\nrating (whether the stock is investment grade – i.e. rated BBB or higher – or non-investment \\ngrade – i.e. lower than BBB). A company whose stock is rated as investment grade can \\ninvite banks to bid for the opportunity to carry out a bought deal, or opt for book-building. \\nWhatever procedure is chosen, the deal is completed within a shortened time frame.\\nFor non-investment grade companies, the placement procedure is closer to the capital \\nincrease procedure via book-building.\\nConvertible bonds, despite their apparent complexity, are products that are relatively easy to \\nplace as they offer substantial guarantees. They can be sold to investors within a relatively \\nshort period.\\nThe procedure for placing a syndicated loan is similar to that for placing a bond issue with \\na limited number of investors. The banks involved are generally keen to develop a business \\nrelationship with the borrower.'),\n",

In particular, we will examine their impact on value, keeping in mind that basically \\nto maximise a value, we must minimise a cost. The chapters in this section will introduce \\nyou to the investment decision processes within a firm and their impact on the overall \\nvalue of the company.\\nSection 26.1\\nTHE PURPOSE OF FINANCE IS TO CREATE VALUE\\n1/ INVESTMENT AND VALUE\\nThe accounting rules we looked at in Chapter 4 showed us that an investment is a use \\nof funds, but not a reduction in the value of assets. We will now go one step further and \\nadopt the viewpoint of the financial manager for whom a profitable investment is one \\nthat increases the value of capital employed.\\nWe shall see that a key element in the theory of markets in equilibrium is the market \\nvalue of capital employed. This theory underscores the direct link between the return on \\na company’s investments and that required by investors buying the financial securities \\nissued by the company.\\nThe true measure of an investment policy is the effect it has on the value of capital \\nemployed. This concept is sometimes called “enterprise value”, a term our reader should \\nnot confuse with the value of equity (capital employed less net debt). The two are far from \\nthe same!\\nHence the importance of every investment decision, as it can lead to three different \\noutcomes:\\ntWhere the expected return on an investment is higher than that required by investors, \\nthe value of capital employed rises instantly. An investment of 100 that always yields \\n15% in a market requiring a 10% return is worth 150 (100 × 15%/10%). The value \\nof capital employed thus immediately rises by 50.'),\n",

The investors put in 100, the investment is worth 100 \\nand no value has been created.\\n t Where the expected return on an investment is lower than that required by investors, \\nthey have incurred a loss.

We shall now cross over \\nto the other side to look at them from the issuing company’s point of view.\\ntEach amount contributed by investors represents a resource for the company.\\nt The financial securities held by investors as assets are recorded as liabilities in the \\ncompany’s balance sheet.\\nt And, most importantly, the rate of return required by investors represents a financial \\ncost to the company.\\nAt the financial level, a company is a portfolio of assets financed by the securities \\nissued on financial markets. Its liabilities, i.e. the securities issued and placed with inves-\\ntors, are merely a financial representation of the industrial or operating assets. The finan-\\ncial manager’s job is to ensure that this representation is as transparent as possible.\\nWhat is the role of the investor?\\nInvestors play an active role when securities are issued, because they can simply \\nrefuse to finance the company by not buying the securities. In other words, if the finan-\\ncial manager cannot come up with a product offering a risk/reward trade-off accept-\\nable to the financial market, the lack of funding will eventually push the company into \\nbankruptcy.\\nWe shall see that when this happens, it is often too late. However, the financial system \\ncan impose a sanction that is far more immediate and effective: the valuation of the securi-\\nties issued by the company.\\nThe investor has the power not just to provide funds, but also to value the company’s \\ncapital employed through the securities already in issue.\\nFinancial markets continuously value the securities in issue. In the case of debt instru-\\nments, rating agencies assign a credit rating to the company, thus determining the value \\nof its existing debt and the terms of future loans. Similarly, by valuing the shares issued \\nthe market is, in fact, valuing the company’s equity.\\nSo how does this mechanism work?\\nIf a company cannot satisfy investors’ risk/reward requirements, it is penalised by a \\nlower valuation of its capital employed and, accordingly, its equity. Suppose a company \\noffers the market an investment of 100 that is expected to yield 10 every year over a period \\nlong enough to be considered to perpetuity.1 However, the actual yield is only 5. The \\ndisappointed investors who were expecting a 10% return will try to get rid of their invest-\\nment. The equilibrium price will be 50, because at this price investors receive a return of \\n10% (5/50) and it is no longer in their interests to sell. But by now it is too late.\\nInvestors who are unhappy with the offered risk/reward trade-off sell their securities, \\nthus depressing the value of the securities issued and of capital employed, since the com-\\npany’s investments are not profitable enough with regard to their risk. True, the investor \\ntakes a hit, but it is sometimes wiser to cut one’s losses.\\nIn doing so, he is merely giving tit for tat: an unhappy investor will sell off his securi-\\nties, thus lowering prices. Ultimately, this can lead to financing difficulties for the company.\\n1 This strong \\nassumption\\nsimplifies the \\ncalculation but it \\ndoes not modify \\nthe reasoning.'),\n",

We see why the valuation of equity is so important for any normally develop-\\ning company. This does not apply just to listed companies: unlisted companies are also \\naffected whenever they envisage divestments, alliances, transfers or capital increases.\\nThe role of creditors looms large only when the company is in difficulty. The com-\\npany then “belongs” to the creditors, and changes in the value of capital employed derive \\nfrom changes in the value of the debt, by then generally lower than its nominal value. This \\nis where the creditors come into play.\\nThe valuation of capital employed, and therefore the valuation of equity, are the key \\nvariables of any ﬁnancial policy, regardless of whether or not the company is listed.\\n3/ IMPLICATIONS\\nSince we consider that creating value is the overriding financial objective of a company, \\nit follows that:\\ntA financial decision harms the company if it reduces the value of capital employed.\\nt A decision is beneficial to the company if it increases the value of capital employed.\\nA word of caution, however! Contrary to appearances, this does not mean that every \\ngood financial decision increases earnings or reduces costs.\\nFinancial shortsightedness consists of failing to distinguish between cost and reduction \\nin value, or between income and increase in value.\\nRemember, we are not in the realm of accounting, but in that of finance – in other words, \\nvalue. An investment financed by cash from operations may increase earnings, but could \\nstill be insufficient with regard to the return expected by the investor who, as a result, has \\nlost value.\\nCertain legal decisions, such as restricting a shareholder’s voting rights, have no \\nimmediate impact on the company’s cash, yet may reduce the value of the corresponding \\nfinancial security and thus prove costly to the holder of the security.\\nWe cannot emphasise this aspect enough and insist that you adopt this approach \\nbefore immersing yourselves further in the raptures of financial theory.\\nSection 26.2\\nVALUE CREATION AND MARKETS IN EQUILIBRIUM\\nCorporate ﬁnancial policy consists ﬁrst and foremost of a set of principles necessary for \\ntaking decisions designed to maximise value for the providers of funds, in particular \\nshareholders.\\n2 Since there is \\nalways a risk, \\ntheir required \\nrate of return \\ncomprises a risk \\npremium.'),\n",

Financial \\nmanagement consists of assessing the value created for the company’s fund providers.\\nCan the overall value of the company be determined by an optimal choice of assets \\nand liabilities? If so, how can you be sure of making the right decisions to create value?\\nYou may already have raised the following questions:\\nt Can the choice of financing alone increase the value of the firm? Is capital employed \\nfinanced half by debt and half by equity worth more than if it were financed wholly \\nthrough equity?\\nt Can the entrepreneur increase the value of capital employed – that is, influence the \\nmarket’s valuation of it – by either combining independent industrial and commercial \\ninvestments or implementing a shrewd financing policy?\\nIf your answer to all these questions is yes, you attribute considerable powers to \\nfinancial managers. You consider them capable of creating value independently of their \\nindustrial and commercial assets.\\nAnd yet, the equilibrium theory of markets is very clear:\\nWhen looking at valuations, ﬁnancial investors are not interested in the underlying \\nﬁnancial engineering, because they could duplicate such operations themselves. This is \\ncalled the value additivity rule.\\nWe now provide a more formal explanation of the above rule, which is based on \\narbitrage. \\nTo this end, let us simplify things by imagining that there are just two options for the \\nfuture: either the company does well or it does not. We shall assign an equal probability \\nto each of these outcomes. \\nWe shall see how the free cash flow of three companies varies in our two states of \\nthe world:\\nFREE CASH FLOW\\nState of the world: bad State of the world: good\\nA 200 1000\\nB 400 500\\nG 600 1500\\nNote that the sum of the free cash flows of companies A and B is equal to that of company \\nG. We shall demonstrate that the share price of company G is equal to the sum of the prices \\nof shares B and A.3 To do so, let us assume that this is not the case, and that VA + VB > VG\\n(where VA, VB and VG are the respective share prices of A, B and G).\\nYou will see that no speculation is necessary here to earn money. Taking no risk, you \\nsell short one share of A and one share of B and buy one share of G. You immediately \\nreceive VA + VB − VG > 0; yet, regardless of the company’s fortunes, the future negative \\nflows of shares A and B (sold) and positive flows of share G (bought) will cancel each \\nother out. You have realised a gain through arbitrage.\\n3  We are \\nassuming that \\ncompanies A, B \\nand G have the \\nsame number of \\nshares.'),\n",

We therefore deduce that VA + VB = VG. It is thus clear that \\na diversified company, in our case G, is not worth more than the sum of its two divisions \\nA and B.\\nLet us now look at the following three securities:\\nFREE CASH FLOW\\nCompany State of the world: bad State of the world: good\\nC 100 1000\\nD 500 500\\nE 600 1500\\nAccording to the rule demonstrated above, VC + VD = VE. Note that security D could be \\na debt security and C share capital. E would then be the capital employed. The value of \\ncapital employed of an indebted company ( V(C+D)) can be neither higher nor lower than \\nthat of the same company if it had no debt (VE).\\nThe additivity rule is borne out in terms of risk: if the company takes on debt, finan-\\ncial investors can stabilise their portfolios by adding less risky securities. Conversely, they \\ncan go into debt themselves in order to buy less risky securities. So why should they pay \\nfor an operation they can carry out themselves at no cost?\\nThis reasoning applies to diversification as well. If its only goal is to create financial \\nvalue without generating industrial and commercial synergies, there is no reason why \\ninvestors should entrust the company with the diversification of their portfolio.\\n2/ ILLUSTRATION\\nAre some asset combinations worth more than the value of their individual components, \\nregardless of any industrial synergies arising when some operations are common to sev-\\neral investment projects? In other words, is the whole worth more than the sum of its parts \\n(2+ 2 = 5)?\\nOr again, is the required rate of return lower simply because two investments are \\nmade at the same time? \\nCompany managers are fuzzy on this issue. They generally answer in the negative, \\nalthough their actual investment decisions tend to imply the opposite. Take Bulgari (a\\nleading jewellery group), for example, which was bought by LVMH in 2011. If financial \\nsynergies exist, one would have to conclude that the required rate of return in the jewel-\\nlery segment differs depending on whether the company is independent or part of a group. \\nBulgari would therefore appear to be worth more as part of the LVMH group than on a \\nstandalone basis.\\nThe question is not as specious at it seems. In fact, it raises a fundamental issue. If \\nthe required return on Bulgari has fallen since it became part of LVMH, its financing \\ncosts will have declined as well, giving it a substantial, permanent and possibly decisive \\nadvantage over its competitors.\\nDiversifying corporate activities reduces risk, but does it also reduce the rate of return \\nrequired by investors?'),\n",

Will the required rate of return on the new group be lower than \\n(10%+ 8%) / 2 = 9% because it carries less risk than the initial single-product company?\\nWe must not be misled into believing that a lower degree of risk must be always \\nmatched by a lower required rate of return. On the contrary: markets only remunerate \\nsystematic or market risks, i.e. those that cannot be eliminated by diversification. We \\nhave seen that unsystematic or specific risks, which investors can eliminate by diversify-\\ning their portfolios, are not remunerated. Only non-diversifiable risks related to market \\nfluctuations are remunerated. This point was discussed in Chapter 18.\\nSince diversifiable risks are not remunerated, a company’s value remains the \\nsame whether it is independent or part of a group . Bulgari is not worth more now \\nthat it has become a division of LVMH. All else being equal, the required rate of return \\nin the jewellery sector is the same whether the company is independent or belongs to a \\ngroup.\\nOn the other hand, Bulgari’s value will increase if, and only if, LVMH’s management \\nallows it to improve its return on capital employed.\\nPurely ﬁnancial diversiﬁcation creates no value.\\nValue is created only when the sum of cash flows from the two investments is higher \\nbecause they are both managed by the same group. This is the result of industrial syner-\\ngies (2 + 2 = 5), and not financial synergies, which do not exist.\\nThe large groups that indulged in a spate of financial diversifications in the 1960s \\nhave since realised that these operations were unproductive and frequently loss-making. \\nDiversification is a delicate art that can only succeed if the diversifying company already \\nhas expertise in the new business. Combining investments per se does not maximise \\nvalue, unless industrial synergies exist. Otherwise, an investment is either “good” or \\n“bad” depending on how it stacks up against the required rate of return.\\nIn other words, managers must act on cash flows; they cannot influence the dis-\\ncount rate applied to them unless they reduce their risk exposure.\\nThere is no connection between the required return on any investment and the portfolio \\nin which the investment is held.\\nUnless it can draw on industrial synergies, the value of a company remains the same \\nwhether it is independent or part of a large group. The ﬁnancial investor does not want \\nto pay a premium in the form of lower returns for something he can do himself at no cost \\nby diversifying his portfolio.\\n3/ A FIRST CONCLUSION\\nThe value of the securities issued by a company is not connected to the underlying finan-\\ncial engineering. Instead, it simply reflects the market’s reaction to the perceived profit-\\nability and risk of the industrial and commercial operations.\\nThe equilibrium theory of markets leads us to a very simple and obvious rule, \\nthat of the additivity of value, which in practice is frequently neglected.

This means that they have to sell the very sub-\\nstance of the company (future risk and returns) in a ﬁnancial form.\\nFinancial investors evaluate the securities offered or already issued according to their \\nrequired rate of return. By valuing the company’s share, they are, in fact, directly valuing \\nthe company’s operating assets.\\nThe valuation of the different securities has nothing to do with ﬁnancial engineering; it \\nis based on a valuation of the company’s industrial and commercial assets.\\nWe emphasise that this rule applies to listed and unlisted companies alike, a fact that the \\nlatter are forced to face at some point. Capital employed always has an equilibrium value, \\nand the entrepreneur must ultimately recognise it.\\nThis approach should be incorporated into the methodology of financial decision-\\nmaking. Some strategies are based on maximising other types of value, for example the \\ncapability to cause harm to competitors. They are particularly risky and are outside the \\nconceptual framework of corporate finance. \\nThe ﬁrst reﬂex when faced with any kind of ﬁnancial decision is to analyse whether \\nit will create or destroy value. If values are in equilibrium, ﬁnancial decisions will be \\nimmaterial.\\nDoes this mean that, ultimately, financing or diversification policies have no impact on \\nvalue?\\nOn the contrary, the equilibrium theory of markets represents a kind of ideal that is very \\nuseful for the ﬁnancial professional but, like all ideals, tends to remain out of reach. In \\na way, it is the paradise that all ﬁnancial managers strive for, while secretly hoping never \\nto reach such a perfect state of boredom. \\nOur aim is not to encourage nihilism, merely a degree of humility.\\nSection 26.3\\nVALUE AND ORGANISATION THEORIES\\n1/ LIMITS OF THE EQUILIBRIUM THEORY OF MARKETS\\nThe equilibrium theory of markets offers an overall framework, but it completely disre-\\ngards the immediate interests of the various parties involved, even if their interests tend to \\nconverge in the medium term.\\nParadoxically, the neoclassical theory emphasises the general interest while completely \\noverlooking that of the individual parties.\\nWe cannot rely on the equilibrium theory alone to explain corporate ﬁnance.'),\n",

According to the equilibrium theory of markets, invest-\\ning at the required rate of return does not change the value of capital employed. But if \\nthe investment is very risky and, therefore, potentially very profitable, creditors, who \\nearn a fixed rate, will only see the increased risk without a corresponding increase in \\ntheir return. The value of their claims thus decreases to the benefit of shareholders whose \\nshares increase by the same amount, the value of capital employed remaining the same. \\nAnd yet, this investment was made at its equilibrium price.\\nThis is where the financial manager comes into play! His role is to distribute value \\nbetween the various parties involved. In fact, the financial manager must be a negotia-\\ntor at heart.\\nBut let’s not forget that the managers of the company are stakeholders as well. Since \\nportfolio theory presupposes good diversification, there is a distinction between inves-\\ntors and managers, who have divergent interests with different levels of information \\n(internal and external). This last point calls into question one of the basic tenets of the \\nequilibrium theory, which is that all parties have access to the same information (see \\nChapter 15).\\n2/ SIGNALLING THEORY AND ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION\\nSignalling theory is based on two basic ideas:\\ntthe same information is not available to all parties: the managers of a company may \\nhave more information than investors;\\nt even if the same information were available to all, it would not be perceived in the \\nsame way, a fact frequently observed in everyday life.\\nThus, it is unrealistic to assume that information is fairly distributed to all parties at \\nall times, i.e. that it is symmetrical as in the case of efficient markets. On the contrary, \\nasymmetric information is the rule.\\nIn short, perfect and equally shared information is at best an objective, and most often \\nan illusion.\\nThis can clearly raise problems. Asymmetric information may lead investors to under-\\nvalue a company. As a result, its managers might hesitate to increase its capital because \\nthey consider the share price to be too low. This may mean that profitable investment \\nopportunities are lost for lack of financing, or that the existing shareholders find their \\nstake adversely diluted because the company has launched a capital increase anyway.'),\n",

Basing financial deci-\\nsions on financial criteria alone is not enough: managers also have to convince the mar-\\nkets that these decisions are wise.\\nAs a result, pure ﬁnancial expertise does not sufﬁce if it is not matched by an ability to \\ncommunicate and to shape market sentiment.\\nThe cornerstone of the financial communications policy is the signal the managers of a \\ncompany send to investors. \\nContrary to what many financial managers and CEOs believe, the signal is neither an \\nofficial statement nor a confidential tip. It is a real financial decision, taken freely and \\nwhich may have negative financial consequences for the decision-maker if it turns \\nout to be wrong.\\nAfter all, investors are far from naive and they take each signal with the requisite \\npinch of salt. Three points merit attention:\\ntInvestors’ first reaction is to ask themselves why the signal is being sent, since \\nnothing comes for free in the financial world. The signal will be perceived nega-\\ntively if the issuer’s interests are contrary to those of investors. For example, the sale \\nof a company by its majority shareholder would, in theory, be a negative signal for \\nthe company’s growth prospects. Managers must therefore persuade the buyer of the \\ncontrary or provide a convincing explanation for the disposal.\\nSimilarly, owner-managers cannot fool investors by praising the merits of a cap-\\nital increase without subscribing to it!\\nHowever, the market will consider the signal to be credible if it deems that it is \\nin the issuer’s interest that the signal be correct. This would be the case, for example, \\nif the managers reinvest their own assets in the company.\\nt The reputation of management and its communications policy  certainly play a \\nrole, but we must not overestimate their importance or lasting impact.\\nt The market supervisory authorities stand ready to impose penalties  on the dis-\\nsemination of misleading information or insider trading. If investors, particularly \\ninternational investors, believe that supervision is effective, they will factor this into \\ntheir decisions. That said, some managers may be tempted to send incorrect sig-\\nnals in order to obtain unwarranted advantages. For example, they could give overly \\noptimistic guidance on their company’s prospects in order to push up share prices. \\nHowever, markets catch on to such misrepresentations quickly and react to incorrect \\nsignals by piling out of the stock.\\nIn such a context, the “watchdog” role played by the market authorities is crucial and the \\nrecent past has shown that the authorities intend to assume it in full. Such rigour is essential \\nif we are to have the best possible financial markets and the lowest possible financing costs.\\nFinancial managers must therefore always consider how investors will react to their \\nfinancial decisions. They cannot content themselves with wishful thinking, but must make a \\nrational and detailed analysis of the situation to ensure that their communication is convincing.\\nSignalling theory says that corporate financial decisions (e.g. financing, dividend \\npayout) are signals sent by the company’s managers to investors. It examines the incen-\\ntives that encourage good managers to issue the right signals and discourage managers \\nof ailing companies from using these same signals to give a misleading picture of their \\ncompany’s financial health.'),\n",

It considers a company \\nto be a legal arrangement that is the culmination of a complex process in which the con-\\nflicting objectives of individuals, some of whom may represent other organisations, are \\nresolved by means of a set of contractual relationships.\\nOn this basis, a company’s behaviour can be compared to that of a market, insofar \\nas it is the result of a complex balancing process. Taken individually, the various stake-\\nholders in the company have their own objectives and interests that may not necessarily \\nbe spontaneously reconcilable. As a result, conflicts may arise between them, especially \\nsince our modern corporate system requires that the suppliers of funds entrust the manag-\\ners with the actual administration of the company.\\nAgency theory analyses the consequences of certain financial decisions in terms of \\nrisk, profitability and, more generally, the interests of the various parties. It shows that \\nsome decisions may go against the simple criteria of maximising the wealth of all parties \\nto the benefit of just one of the suppliers of funds.\\nTo simplify, we consider that an agency relationship exists between two parties when \\none of them, the agent, carries out an activity on behalf of the other, the principal. The \\nagent has been given a mandate to act or take decisions on behalf of the principal. This is \\nthe essence of the agency relationship.\\nThis very broad definition allows us to include a variety of domains, such as the \\nresolution of conflicts between:\\ntexecutive shareholders/non-executive shareholders;\\nt non-shareholder executives/shareholders;\\nt creditors/shareholders.\\nShareholders give the company executives a mandate to manage to the best of their \\nability the funds that have been entrusted to them. However, their concern is that the \\nexecutives could pursue objectives other than maximising the value of the equity, such \\nas increasing the company’s size at the cost of profitability, minimising the risk to capital \\nemployed by rejecting certain investments that would create value but could put the com-\\npany in difficulty if they fail, etc.\\nOne way of resolving such conflicts of interest is to use stock options, thus linking \\nmanagement compensation to share performance (see Chapter 43). \\nDebt plays a role as well since it has a constraining effect on managers and encour-\\nages them to maximise cash flows so that the company can meet its interest and principal \\npayments. Failing this, the company risks bankruptcy and the managers lose their jobs. '),\n",

Thus, the interests of management and shareholders converge. \\nMaybe debt is the modern whip! This is sometimes referred to as “the discipline of debt”.\\nThe diverging interests of the various parties generate a number of costs called \\n“agency costs”. These comprise:\\ntthe cost of monitoring managers’ efforts (control procedures, audit systems, perfor-\\nmance-based compensation) to ensure that they correspond to the principal’s objec-\\ntives. Stock options represent an agency cost since they are exercised at less than the \\ngoing market price for the stock;\\nt the costs incurred by the agents to vindicate themselves and reassure the principals \\nthat their management is effective, such as the publication of annual reports;\\nt residual costs.\\nAnget al. (2000) have shown that the margins and asset turnover rates of small- and \\nmedium-sized American firms tend to be lower in companies managed by non-sharehold-\\ning CEOs, and in which managers have little stake in the capital and many non-executive \\nshareholders.\\nThe main references in this field are Jensen and Meckling (1976), Grossman \\nand Hart (1980) and Fama (1980). Their research aims to provide a scientific explana-\\ntion of the relationship between managers and shareholders and its impact on corporate \\nvalue.\\nTheir main contribution is to try and compare ﬁnancial theory and organisational theory.\\nThis research forms the intellectual foundation on which the concept of corporate gover-\\nnance was built (see Chapter 43).\\n4/ FREE RIDERS\\nWe saw above that the interests of the different types of providers of funds may diverge, \\nbut so may those of members of the same category.\\nThe term “free rider” is used to describe the behaviour of an investor who beneﬁts from \\ntransactions carried out by other investors in the same category without participating \\nin these transactions himself.\\nThis means, first, that there must be several – usually a large number – of investors in the \\nsame type of security and, second, that a specific operation is undertaken implying some sort \\nof sacrifice, at least in terms of opportunity cost, on the part of the investors in these securities.\\nAs a result, when considering a financial decision, one must examine whether free \\nriders exist and what their interests might be.\\nBelow are two examples:\\nt Responding to a takeover bid: if the offer is motivated by synergies between the bidding \\ncompany and its target, the business combination will create value. This means that it \\nis in the general interest of all parties for the bid to succeed and for the shareholders to \\ntender their shares.

Bank A would thus hold a better-valued existing claim \\nwithout incurring a discount on the new credits granted.\\nSection 26.4\\nHOW CAN  WE  CREATE  VALUE ?\\nBefore we begin simulating different rates of return, we would like to emphasise once \\nagain that a project, investment or company can only realise extraordinary returns if \\nit enjoys a strategic advantage. The equilibrium theory of markets tells us that under \\nperfect competition, the net present value of a project should be nil. If a financial man-\\nager wants to advise on investment choices, he will no doubt have to make a number \\nof calculations to estimate the future return of the investment. But he will also have to \\nlook at it from a strategic point of view, incorporating the various economic theories he \\nhas learned.\\nA project’s real profitability can only be explained in terms of economic rent – that \\nis, a position in which the return obtained on investments is higher than the required \\nrate of return given the degree of risk . The essence of all corporate strategies is to \\nobtain economic rents – that is, to generate imperfections in the product market and/or in \\nfactors of production, thus creating barriers to entry that the corporate managers strive to \\nexploit and defend.\\nSource: Compilation données Exane BNP Paribas\\nROCE\\nWACC 300\\n400\\n500\\n8%\\n10%\\n12%\\n14%\\nROCE, WACC for large listed European groups (left-hand scale) and stock\\nmarket prices (right-hand scale)\\nEurostoxx 600\\n-\\n100\\n200\\n-\\n2%\\n4%\\n6%\\n(*) As of Q1 2014\\nROCE minus WACC\\n19951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014e'),\n",

Returns that are higher than \\nthe required rate, taking into account the risk exposure, inevitably attract the attention \\nof competitors or of the antitrust authorities, as in the case of Google. Sooner or later, \\nderegulation and technological advances put an end to them. There are no impregnable \\nfortresses, only those for which the right angle of attack has not yet been found.\\nA strategic analysis of the company is thus essential to put the figures in their eco-\\nnomic and industrial context, as we explained in Chapter 8.\\nWe insist on the consequences of a good strategy. When based on accurate forecasts, \\nit immediately boosts the value of capital employed and, accordingly, the share price. This \\nexplains the difference between the book value of capital employed and its market value, \\nwhich may vary by a factor of 1–10, and sometimes even more.\\nRather than rising gradually as the returns on the investment accrue, the share price \\nadjusts immediately so that the investor receives the exact required return, no more, no \\nless. And if everything proceeds smoothly thereafter, the investment will generate the \\nrequired return until expectations prove too optimistic or too pessimistic.\\nSection 26.5\\nVALUE AND TAXATION\\nDepending on the company’s situation, certain types of securities may carry tax benefits. \\nYou are certainly aware that tax planning can generate savings, thereby creating value or \\nat least preventing the loss of value. Reducing taxes is a form of value creation for inves-\\ntors and shareholders. All else being equal, an asset with tax-free flows is worth more than \\nthe same asset subject to taxation.\\nBetter to have a liability with cash outflows that can be deducted from taxes than the \\nsame liability with outflows that are not deductible.\\nThis goes without saying, and any CFO worthy of his title will do his best to reduce \\ntax payments.\\nHowever, tax optimisation should not merely endeavour to reduce costs if this leads to \\nhigher risks. Financial managers must think in terms of value.\\nThey must carefully examine the impact each financial decision will have on taxes. The \\nmain issues we shall be addressing in the subsequent chapters are:\\nttaxation of debt vs. equity;\\nt taxation of accelerated depreciation and one-off write-downs;\\nt taxation of capital gains vs. ordinary income (dividends or coupons);\\nt taxation of financial income and expenses;\\nt tax groups;\\nt usable or unusable tax-loss carryforwards.\\nOur experience tells us that taking a financial decision solely on the basis of tax con-\\nsiderations is rarely the right thing to do. Waiting a few months to sell in order to benefit \\nfrom a more favorable tax rate exposes the group to a drop in the value of the asset to be \\nsold (that could well be much higher than the tax savings).'),\n",

If this condition is met, the share price or the value of the share will \\nrise. If not, it will fall. The theory of markets in equilibrium teaches us that it is very difﬁcult \\nto create lasting value. Rates of return actually achieved tend, over the medium term, to \\nmeet required rates of return, given technological progress and deregulation, which reduce \\nentry barriers and economic rents that all managers must strive to create and defend, even if \\nsooner or later they will be eliminated. Similarly, diversiﬁcation or debt cannot create value \\nfor the investor who can, at no cost on an individual level, diversify his portfolio or go into \\ndebt. Finally, there is no connection between the required return on any investment and \\nthe portfolio in which the investment is held – value can only be created by industrial \\nsynergies. Financial synergies do not exist.\\nIt is important to understand that the creation of value is not just the outcome of a calcula-\\ntion of returns. It has an economic basis which is a sort of economic rent that comes out of a \\nstrategy, the purpose of which is to “skew” market mechanisms. Accordingly, the conceptual \\nframework of the theory of markets in equilibrium alone fails to explain corporate ﬁnance.\\nSignal and agency theory were developed to make up for the shortcomings of the theory of \\nmarkets in equilibrium.\\nSignal theory is based on the assumption that information is not equally available to all \\nparties at the same time, and that information asymmetry is the rule. This can have disas-\\ntrous consequences and result in very low valuations or a suboptimal investment policy. \\nAccordingly, certain ﬁnancial decisions, known as signals, are taken to shake up this informa-\\ntion asymmetry. These signals can, however, have a negative ﬁnancial impact on the party \\nwho initiates them if they turn out to be unfounded.\\nAgency theory calls into question the claim that all of the stakeholders in the company \\n(shareholders, managers, creditors) have a single goal – to create value. Agency theory \\nshows how, on the contrary, their interests may differ and some decisions (related to borrow-\\ning, for example) or products (stock options) come out of attempts at achieving convergence \\nbetween the interests of managers and shareholders or at protecting creditors. Agency theory \\nforms the intellectual basis of corporate governance.\\nSUMMARY\\n1/Take the example on page 477 and give a probability of 50% to the two states of the \\nworld.

They come under a confusing array of acronyms – \\nTSR, MV A, EV A, CFROI, ROCE, W ACC – but most of these will probably be winnowed \\nout in the years to come. Ultimately, they should be reduced to those few that best mirror \\nand address the recent developments in cash flow statements.\\nThe current profusion of indicators has its advantages, as normally we expect only \\nthe most reliable to survive. However, in practice some companies use the lack of clear \\nguidelines and standards to choose indicators that best serve their interests at a given time, \\neven if this involves the laborious task of changing indicators on a routine basis.\\nThe chart below should help you find your way through the maze of indicators.

Gradually, investors become more experienced and financial \\nmarkets become more influential, and therefore are less prone to misinterpreting company \\ndata.\\nValue creation indicators fall into four categories:\\nt Accounting indicators. Until the mid-1980s, companies mainly communicated their \\nnet profit/loss or earnings per share (EPS) . Regrettably, this is a key accounting \\nparameter that is also very easy to manipulate. This practice of massaging EPS is \\ncalled “window dressing”, or improving the presentation of the accounts by adjust-\\ning exceptional items, provisions, etc. The growing emphasis on operating profit or \\nEBITDA represents an improvement because it considerably reduces the impact of \\nexceptional items and non-cash expenses.\\nThe second-generation accounting indicators appeared as investors began to \\nreason in terms of profitability, i.e. efficiency, by comparing return with the equity \\nused. One such ratio is called return on equity, or ROE. However, it is possible to \\nleverage this value as well, since a company can boost its ROE by skilfully raising \\nits debt level. Even though ROE might look more attractive, no “real” value has been \\ncreated since the increased profitability is cancelled out by higher risk not reflected \\nin accounting data.\\nSince the return on capital employed (ROCE) indicator avoids this bias, it has \\ntended to become the main measure of economic performance. Only in a few sectors \\nof activity is it meaningless to use ROCE (such as in banking or insurance, where \\nfixed assets and working capital are only a fraction of the assets). In those industries, \\nreturn on equity (ROE) is widely used.\\nWhile NPV and other economic indicators represent valuable tools for strate-\\ngic analysis and a good basis for estimating the market value of companies, they \\nare based on projections that are frequently difficult to assess. Unfortunately, the \\ncash flow for one single year is easy to manipulate and meaningless. Indeed, it is \\nnot intuitively interpretable. At the same time, we know that the major drivers of \\ncash flows are the growth of earnings and revenues of the company and ROCE. By \\nfocusing attention on ROCE, there is a better intuitive grasp of how the company is \\nperforming. It is then easier to assess the firm’s growth both over time and relative \\nto its industry.\\nt Accounting/financial indicators emerged with the realisation that profitability per \\nse cannot fully measure value because it does not factor in risks. To measure value, \\nreturns must also be compared with the cost of capital employed. Using the cost of \\nfinancing a company, called the weighted average cost of capital, or W ACC,1  it is \\npossible to assess whether value has been created (i.e. when return on capital \\nemployed is higher than the cost of capital employed) or destroyed (i.e. when return \\non capital employed is lower than the cost of capital employed).\\nBut companies can also go one step further by applying the calculation to cap-\\nital employed at the beginning of the year in order to measure the value created\\n1 See Chapter 29.'),\n",

The difference can then be expressed in currency units rather than \\nas a percentage. This popular measure of value creation has been most notably devel-\\noped in the EV A, or economic value added , model. It is also known as economic\\nprofit.\\nt Financial indicators. Yet the best of all indicators is undoubtedly net present value\\n(see NPV, Chapter 16), which provides the exact measure of value created. It has \\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated that intrinsic value creation is the principal driver of \\ncompanies’ market value. But NPV has one drawback because it must be computed \\nover several periods. For the external analyst who does not have access to all the \\nnecessary information, the NPV criterion becomes difficult to handle. The quick and \\neasy solution is to use the above-mentioned ratios. It is important to remember that \\nwhile the other ratios are simpler to use, they are also less precise and may prove \\nmisleading when not used with care.\\nt Market indicators: market value added (MV A) and total shareholder return (TSR)\\nare highly sensitive to the stock market. MV A represents the difference between the \\nvalue of equity and net debt and the book value of capital employed. It is expressed \\nin currency units. TSR is expressed as a percentage and corresponds to the addition of \\nthe return on the share (dividends/value of the share) and the capital gains rate (capi-\\ntal gains during the period divided by the initial share value). It is the return earned \\nby a shareholder who bought the share at the beginning of a period, earned dividends \\nand then sold the share at the end of the period.\\nA major weakness with these two measures is that they may show destruction \\nin value because of declining investor expectations about future profits, even though \\nthe company’s return on capital employed is higher than its cost of capital. This hap-\\npened to L’Oréal, which saw its share price remain flat from 2000 to 2012. However, \\nduring this time, its ROCE was between 12 and 19% per year whereas its cost of \\ncapital was only about 8%. Conversely, in a bull market, a company with mediocre\\neconomic performance may have flattering TSR and MV A. In the long term, these \\nhighs and lows are smoothed out and TSR and MV A would eventually reflect the \\ncompany’s modest performance. Yet in the meantime, there may be some major \\ndivergences between these indicators and company performance.\\nThese considerations prompted some stock exchange authorities to recommend \\nmaking a clear distinction between economic indicators and measures of stock mar-\\nket value creation (TSR and MV A). The former measure the past year’s performance, \\nwhile the latter tend to reflect anticipation of future value creation. The measures \\nof stock market value creation take into account the share price, which reflects this \\nanticipation. Yet the different measures of economic performance and stock market \\nvalue are complementary, rather than contradictory.\\nSection 27.2\\nNPV, THE ONLY RELIABLE CRITERION\\nIt should now be clear that the concept of value corresponds perfectly to the measure of \\nnet present value (NPV). Financial management consists of constantly measuring the net \\npresent value of an investment, project, company or source of financing. Obviously, one \\nshould only allocate resources if the net present value is positive; in other words, if the '),\n",

Net present value reflects how allocation \\nof the company’s resources has led to the creation or destruction of value. On the one \\nhand, there is a constant search for anticipated financial flows – while keeping in mind \\nthe uncertainty of these forecasts. On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the rate of \\nreturn (k) required by the investors and shareholders providing the funds.\\nThe value created is thus equal to the difference between the capital employed and \\nits book value. Book value is the amount of funds invested in the company’s operations.\\nCreation of value = enterprise value − book value of capital employed.\\nThe creation of value reflects investors’ expectations. Typically, this means that, over \\na certain period, the company will enjoy a rent with a present value allowing its capital \\nemployed to be worth more than its book value!\\nThe same principle applies to choosing a source of financing for allocating resources. \\nTo do so, one must disregard the book value and determine instead the value of the finan-\\ncial security issued and deduct the required rate of return. This approach represents a shift \\nfrom the explicit or accounting cost to the financial cost, which is the return required \\non this category of security. By minimising the cost of a source of financing, one is actu-\\nally minimising the overall financial cost.\\nOn its own, the concept of cost may be insufficient when analysing certain very \\ncomplex products. In such cases, one must resort to the concept of present value. This is \\nparticularly true of hybrid securities.\\nA source of financing is considered cheap only if its net present value is negative.\\nOnce again, the only reliable ﬁnancial criterion is net present value.\\nSection 27.3\\nFINANCIAL /ACCOUNTING CRITERIA\\n1/ ECONOMIC PROFIT OR ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED  (EVA)\\nEconomic profit is less ambitious than net present value. It only seeks to measure the \\nwealth created by the company in each financial year. EV A factors in not just the cost of \\ndebt, such as in calculating net profit, but it also accounts for the cost of equity.\\nThe innovative aspect of EVA is that it identiﬁes the income level at which value is \\ncreated. This is because EVA is calculated after deducting the capital charge, i.e. the \\nremuneration of the funds contributed by creditors and shareholders.\\nEconomic profit or EV A first measures the excess of ROCE over the weighted aver-\\nage cost of capital. Then, to determine the value created during the period, the ratio is \\nmultiplied by the book value of the capital employed at the start of the reporting \\nperiod. Thus, a company that had an opening book value of capital employed of 100 \\nand an after-tax return on capital employed of 12% with a W ACC of only 10% will have \\nearned 2% more than the required rate. It will have created a value of 2 on funds of 100 \\nduring the period.'),\n",

It is a decentralised financial management tool. \\nA firm may be tempted to maximise short-term EV A which may be detrimental to \\nfuture EV As (underinvestment, artificial reduction of working capital). In general, it is \\nvery complex to pick annual criteria that will make it possible to measure value creation \\nfor a firm properly. Only the NPV of future cash flows allows us to take into account the \\nlong-term capacity to create value. \\n2/ CASH  FLOW  RETURN  ON INVESTMENT  (CFROI)\\nThe original version of cash flow return on investment (CFROI) corresponds to the aver-\\nage of the internal rates of return on the company’s existing investments. It measures the \\nIRR earned by a firm’s existing projects.\\nCFROI is the internal rate of return that equals the company’s gross capital employed \\n(GCE), i.e. before depreciation and adjusted for inflation and the series of after-tax \\nEBITDA computed over the lifetime of existing fixed assets (estimated by dividing \\nthe gross value of fixed assets by the depreciation). CFROI is then compared with the \\nweighted average cost of capital. If CFROI is higher than W ACC, the company is creating \\nvalue; if it is lower, then the firm is destroying value.\\nAs with EV A, computing CFROI requires a number of restatements which seem to \\nexist mainly to convince their users to hire the founder of the concept (Holt) to implement \\nit. It is sometimes used in a very simplified manner which makes it very close to a mere \\naccounting criteria (see Section 27.5).\\nSection 27.4\\nMARKET  CRITERIA\\n1/ CREATING  STOCK  MARKET  VALUE  (MARKET  VALUE  ADDED )\\nFor listed companies, market value added (MVA) is equal to:\\nMVA market capitalisation net debt book value of capital employe=+ − dd\\nIn most cases, if no other information is available, we assume that net debt corresponds to \\nits book value. Thus, the equation becomes simpler:\\nValue created Market capitalisation Book value of net debt\\n(Book\\n=+\\n− vvalue of equity Book value of debt)\\nMarket capitalisation Book v\\n+\\n=− aalue of equity'),\n",

However, they are \\nflawed and not appropriate for the purposes of financial analysis, mainly because account-\\ning items can be manipulated and they may not consider the time value of money and the \\nopportunity cost of capital.\\nThe same could be said of the criteria presented next in this section – earnings \\nper share  (EPS), the accounting rate of return and equity per share. However, they \\nare systematically used as analytical criteria for all financial decisions, even at the  \\nboard level.'),\n",

Nor is it correct to assume that there is a constant and automatic link between \\nimproving these criteria and creating value. In order to maximise value, it is simply not \\nenough to maximise these ratios, even if they are linked by a coefficient to value or the \\nrequired rate of return.\\n1/ EARNINGS PER SHARE\\nNotwithstanding the comments just made about earnings per share, many financial man-\\nagers continue to favour using it. Despite its limitations, it is still the most widespread \\nmultiple because it is directly connected to the share price via the price–earnings ratio. \\nEPS’s popularity is rooted in three misconceptions:\\ntthe belief that earnings per share factors in the cost of equity and, therefore, the cost \\nof risk;\\nt the belief that accounting data influence the value of the company. Changing a count-\\ning methods (for inventories, depreciation, goodwill, etc.) will not modify the com-\\npany’s value, even if it does change earnings per share; and\\nt the belief that any financial decision that lifts EPS will change value as well. This \\nwould imply that the P/E ratio3 remains the same before and after the financial deci-\\nsion, which is frequently not the case. Thus, value is not a direct multiple of earnings \\nper share, because the decision may affect investors’ assessment of the company’s \\nrisks and growth potential.\\nConsider Company A which, based upon its risks and growth and profitability pros-\\npects, has a P/E ratio of 20. Its net profit is 50. Company B has equity of 450 with net \\nprofit of 30, giving it a P/E of 15. Company A decides to acquire a controlling interest \\nin Company B, paying a premium of 33% on B’s value, i.e. a total of 600. Company \\nA finances the acquisition entirely by taking on debt at an after-tax cost of 3%. Both \\nCompanies A and B are fairly valued with regards to their risk exposure. There are no \\nindustrial or commercial synergies that could increase the new group’s earnings, and no \\ngoodwill.\\nCompany A’s net profit is thus:\\n3 The P/E \\nratio is equal \\nto price/earn-\\nings per share. \\nIt measures the \\nrelative expense \\nof a share.\\nFormer net proﬁt of A: 50\\n+ net proﬁt of B: 30\\n− cost of ﬁnancing: 18 = 600 × 3% \\n= New net proﬁt of A: 62, or + 24%'),\n",

The increase in earnings per share is therefore equal to that in \\nnet profit; that is, 24%. This certainly seems like an extraordinary result! But has A really \\ncreated value by buying B? The answer is no, since there are no synergies to speak of \\nbetween A and B. Keep in mind that A paid 33% more than B’s equilibrium price. In fact, \\nCompany A has destroyed value in proportion to this premium, i.e. 150, because it cannot \\nbe offset by synergies.\\nIn fact, the explanation for the – apparent – paradox of a 24% rise in earnings per \\nshare matched by a destruction of value is that the buyer’s EPS has increased, because \\nthe P/E of the company bought by means of debt is higher than the after-tax cost of \\nthe debt. Here, B has a P/E of 20 given the 33% premium paid by A on the acquisition. \\nThe inverse of 20 (5%) is much higher than the 3% after-tax cost of the debt for A.\\nAt present low interest rates (3% net of taxes), an acquisition paid in cash must be \\nbased on a P/E ratio of more than 33 to have a negative impact on the EPS4 of the buyer. \\nSuch a situation leaves plenty of margin to manoeuvre.\\nConsider now Company C, which has equity of 1400 with net profit of 140, i.e. a P/E of \\n10. It merges with Company D, which has the same risk exposure, equity of 990 and a P/E \\nof 18 (net profit of 55), with no control premium. Thanks to very strong industrial syner-\\ngies, C is able to boost D’s net profit by 50%. Without doubt, value has been created. And \\nyet, it is not difficult to prove (see Exercise 1) that C’s EPS dropped 7% after the merger. \\nThis is a mechanical effect due simply to the fact that D’s P/E of 18 is higher than C’s P/E \\nof 10, because D has better earnings prospects than C.\\nAt the risk of being repetitious, a word of warning about the widespread fallacy that \\nEPS growth equals value creation. This has led to the misconception that, accordingly, \\nEPS dilution means that value has been destroyed. This is a myth. EPS is an accounting \\nmetric, not a measure of value.\\nSo what was the net result of Company C’s acquisition of Company D? The question is \\nnot whether Company C’s EPS has been enhanced or diluted, but whether it paid \\ntoo much for D. In fact, it did not, since there was no control premium paid and indus-\\ntrial synergies were created. After the operation, C’s share will trade at a higher P/E, as it \\nshould enjoy greater earnings growth thanks to the contribution from D’s higher-growth \\nbusinesses. In the end, the higher P/E ratio should more than compensate for the diluted \\nEPS, lifting the share price. This is only logical considering that the industrial synergies \\ncreated value.\\nIn fact, EPS can be a reliable indicator of value creation under three conditions only:\\ntthe risk on capital employed remains the same from one period to the next, or \\nbefore and after operations such as mergers, capital increases or share buy-backs, \\ninvestments, etc.;\\nt earnings growth remains the same before and after any given operation; and\\nt the company’s ﬁnancial structure remains the same from one period to the next, or \\nbefore and after a given operation.\\nIf these three conditions are met, we can assume that EPS growth reflects the creation of \\nvalue, and EPS dilution the destruction of value.\\n4 Before good-\\nwill accounting.'),\n",

In our example of a combination between A and B \\nfinanced by debt, although A’s EPS rose 24%, its risk increased sharply. Its position is no \\nlonger directly comparable with that before the acquisition of B.\\nSimilarly, C’s post-merger EPS cannot be compared with its EPS prior to the merger. \\nWhile the merger did not change its financial structure, C’s growth rate after the merger \\nwith D is different from what it was beforehand.\\n2/ ACCOUNTING  RATES  OF RETURN\\nAccounting rates of return comprise:\\n t return on equity (ROE);\\n t return on capital employed (ROCE), which was described in Chapter 13; and\\n t cash flow return on investment (CFROI), the simplified version of which compares \\nEBITDA with gross capital employed, i.e. before amortisation and depreciation of \\nfixed assets.\\nCFROI EBITDA\\nCapital employed=\\nThis ratio is used particularly in business sectors wherein charges to deprecia-\\ntion do not necessarily reflect the normal deterioration of fixed assets, e.g. in the hotel \\nbusiness.\\nThe main drawback of accounting rates of return on equity or capital employed is \\nprecisely that they are accounting measures. As shall be demonstrated below, these have \\ntheir dangers.\\nConsider5 Company X, which produces a single product and generates a return of \\n20% on capital employed amounting to 100. X operates in a highly profitable sector and \\nis considering diversifying. Should it expect the present 20% rate of return to be generated \\non other possible projects? If it does, X will never diversify because it is unlikely that any \\nother investments will meet these criteria.\\nHow can this problem be rationally approached? The company generates an account-\\ning return of 20%. Suppose its shareholders and investors require a 10% return. Its market \\nvalue is thus 20/10%, or 200.\\nThe proposed investment amounts to 100 and generates a return of 15% on identical \\nrisks. The required rate of return is constant at 10%. We see that:\\n5 To simplify the \\ndiscount calcula-\\ntion, we assume \\nthat the planned \\ninvestments will \\ngenerate a return \\nto infinity.\\nPresent operating proﬁt 20% × 100 = 20 \\n+ Operating proﬁt on new investment 15% × 100 = 15 \\n= Total 35'),\n",

Value has been created, and X was right to \\ninvest. And yet the return on capital employed fell by 20% to 17.5%, demonstrating that \\nthis criterion is not relevant.\\nIn general, if the investment yields more than the required rate of return, the increase \\nin the value of the company will exceed that of the sums invested.\\nThe inverse example is Company Y , which has a return of 5% on capital employed of \\n100. Assuming the shareholders and investors require a 10% return as well, the value of \\nY’s capital employed is 5/10% = 50.\\nThe proposed investment amounts to 25 and yields a return of 8%. Since we have the \\nsame 10% required return, we get:\\nPresent operating proﬁt 5% × 100 = 5\\n+ Operating proﬁt of new investment 8% × 25 = 2\\n= Total 7\\nThis results in capital employed being valued at 7/10% = 70 (+20), with a return of \\n7/125 = 5.6%\\nThe value of Y’s capital employed has indeed increased by 20, but this is still less \\nthan the increase of 25 in capital invested. Value has been destroyed. The return on the \\ninvestment is just 8%, whereas the required rate is 10%. The company has lost money and \\nshould not have made the investment. And yet the return on capital employed rose from \\n5% to 5.6%.\\nSimilarly, one could demonstrate that ROE increases after an acquisition funded by a \\nshare issue, when the target company’s reverse 1/(P/E) is higher than the buyer’s current \\nROE.\\nFinancial managers should approach book rates of return with caution. These ratios \\nare accounting measures, but not external measures. They assume that the company is \\noperating in a closed system! The minimum criterion should be the return required by \\nthe ﬁnancial system.\\nSetting aside all these accounting concepts, what are the implications for the financial \\nconcept (k)?\\nUnfortunately, investors and corporate managers continue to view decision-making \\nin terms of the impact on accounting measures, even though it has just been demonstrated '),\n",

However, financial managers need to focus \\nfirst and foremost on how financial decisions affect value.\\nSection 27.6\\nPUTTING THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE\\n1/ STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF FINANCIAL INDICATORS\\nAs long as performance measures and their implementation remain so diversified, it is \\nvital to have a good understanding of their respective flaws. By choosing one or another \\nmeasure, companies can present their results in a more or less flattering light. Financial \\nmanagers typically choose those measures that will demonstrate the creation, rather than \\nthe destruction, of value.\\n2/ CREATING VALUE OR VALUES ?\\nOver the past 20 years, the concept of value creation has spread rapidly, to the point where \\nno corporate communication can afford to disregard it. Increasingly, value is assessed not \\njust as it pertains to shareholders, but to all the stakeholders in the company: shareholders, \\nemployees and clients alike.\\nManagers now talk of stakeholder value, customer capital and human capital just as \\nthey do of financial capital.\\nWhile these concepts are certainly very appealing, we believe they are rooted in two \\nmisconceptions:\\n1. The creation of value is sometimes rather hastily accused of leading to layoffs, \\nplant closures, drastic cost reductions or disregard for environmental protection, \\nlabour law and human dignity. In fact, the opposite is true! A look at groups that \\nhave created sustainable value for their shareholders, frequently over long periods, \\nshows that these same companies are at the forefront of innovation, constantly cre-\\nating new markets, meeting new needs, hiring and training employees and inspiring \\nloyalty and strong customer relationships. Just a few examples are L’Oréal, John-\\nson & Johnson, Singapore Airlines, Apple and BMW. Cost-cutting strategies can \\nonly be temporary and they cannot durably create shareholder value. Cost-cutting \\nonly works in the short term and only if it gives rise to a strategy of profitable \\ngrowth.\\n2. Shareholders entrust their money to managers whose task is to multiply it. Finan-\\ncial directors must operate within the framework of a given corporate mission and \\nwith the shareholders’ best interests in mind. When managers pursue other objec-\\ntives, they betray the basic tenet upon which this pact is founded. More impor-\\ntantly, they are sure to fall short of all their objectives.'),\n",

These theories will not be covered again in detail, since the only real novelty is of a \\nsemantic nature. In the sections on financial securities, we calculated the yield to maturity. \\nThe same approach holds for analysing industrial investments, whereby we calculate a \\nrate that takes the present value to zero. This is called the internal rate of return (IRR). \\nInternal rate of return and yield to maturity are thus the same.\\nNet present value (NPV) measures the value created by the investment and is the \\nbest criterion for selecting or rejecting an investment, whether it is industrial or financial. \\nWhen it is simply a matter of deciding whether or not to make an investment, NPV and \\nIRR produce the same outcome. However, if the choice is between two mutually exclu-\\nsive investments, net present value is more reliable than the internal rate of return.\\nThis chapter will discuss:\\nt the cash flows to be factored into investment decisions, which are called incremental \\ncash flows; and\\nt other investment criteria  which are less relevant than NPV and IRR and have \\nproven disappointing in the past. As future financial managers, you should never-\\ntheless be aware of them, even if they are more pertinent to accounting work than \\nfinancial management.\\nSection 28.1\\nTHE PREDOMINANCE OF NPV AND THE IMPORTANCE OF  IRR\\nEach investment has a net present value (NPV), which is equal to the amount of value \\ncreated. Remember that the net present value of an investment is the value of the posi-\\ntive and negative cash flows arising from an investment, discounted at the rate of return \\nrequired by the market. The rate of return is based upon the investment’s risk.\\nFrom a financial standpoint, and if forecasts are correct, an investment with positive \\nNPV is worth making since it will create value. Conversely, an investment with negative \\nNPV should be avoided as it is expected to destroy value. Sometimes investments with \\nnegative NPV are made for strategic reasons, such as to protect a position in the industry \\nsector or to open up new markets with strong, yet hard-to-quantify, growth potential.

Sooner or later, projects with negative NPV have to be offset by other \\ninvestments with positive NPV that create value. Without doing so, the company will be \\nheaded for ruin.\\nAn investment with an NPV of zero will not create value, but it will not destroy value \\neither. All other things being equal, decisions about projects with an NPV of zero are \\nakin to tossing a coin in order to decide whether or not to go ahead.\\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) is simply the rate of return on an investment. Given \\nan investment’s degree of risk, it is financially worthwhile if the IRR is higher than the \\nrequired return. However, if the IRR is lower than the risk-based required rate of return, \\nthe investment will serve no financial purpose.\\nGraham and Harvey (2001) conducted a broad survey of corporate and financial man-\\nagers to determine which tools and criteria they use when making financial decisions. \\nThey asked them to indicate how frequently they used several capital budgeting methods. \\nThe findings showed that net present value and internal rate of return carry the greatest \\nweight, and justifiably so. Some 75% of financial managers systematically value invest-\\nments according to these two criteria.\\nInterestingly, large firms apply these criteria more often than small- and medium-\\nsized companies, and MBA graduates use them systematically while older managers tend \\nto rely on the payback ratio.\\nConclusions are slightly different for small and medium companies for which \\n(according to a study by Danielson and Scott) intuition comes first (26%), then payback \\nratio (19%), ROCE (14%) and NPV (12%).\\nNevertheless, the popularity of NPV is widespread globally, as shown by other stud-\\nies: Dallocchio and Salvi (2000), Hall (2000) and Lumby (1991). \\nFrom a conceptual and methodological point of view, NPV is a better criterion as it \\ntakes into account risk (payback ratio does not), the whole stream of cash flows (idem) \\nand assumes that intermediate cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital, which is \\nmore realistic than IRR (which assumes reinvestment at the IRR which may be above the \\ncost of capital).\\nActual computation of NPV is not always well applied. Often, managers discount \\ncash flows using the cost of capital of the group and not at a rate that reflects the risk of \\nthe specific project. It should be kept in mind that a very risky project will increase \\nthe overall risk of the firm and thus should be discounted at a higher rate  (and vice \\nversa). We will insist on this point in the next chapter.\\nSection 28.2\\nTHE MAIN LINES OF REASONING\\nAny well-advised investment decision must respect the following six principles:\\n1. consider cash flows rather than accounting data;\\n2. reason in terms of incremental cash flows, considering only those associated with \\nthe project;'),\n",

One must therefore analyse the negative and positive cash flows, and not the \\naccounting income and expenses. These accounting measures are irrelevant because they \\ndo not take into account working capital generated by the investment and include depre-\\nciation which is a non-cash item.\\nAs a result, only cash ﬂows are relevant in the ﬁnancial analysis of investments.\\nWe stress the fact that in finance, negative cash flows will only imply a cost from the \\ntime they are paid and positive cash flows will only provide benefits from the time they \\nare actually cashed-in, and this regardless of the accounting treatment.\\n2/ REASON IN TERMS OF INCREMENTAL FLOWS\\nWhen considering an investment, one must take into account all the flows it gener-\\nates, and nothing else but these flows. It is crucial to assess all the consequences of an \\ninvestment upon a company’s cash position. Some of these are self-evident and easy to \\nmeasure, and others are less so.\\nA movie theatre group plans to launch a new complex, and substantial costs have \\nalready been incurred in its design. Should these be included in the investment pro-\\ngramme’s cash flows? The answer is no, since the costs have already been incurred regard-\\nless of whether or not the complex is actually built. These are sunk costs. Therefore, they \\nshould not be considered part of the investment expenditure.\\nIt would be absurd to carry out an investment simply because the preparations were \\ncostly and one hopes to recoup funds that, in any case, have already been spent. The only \\nvalid reason for pursuing an investment is that it is likely to create value.\\nNow, if the personnel department has to administer an additional 20 employees hired \\nfor the new complex (e.g. 5% of its total workforce), should 5% of the department’s costs be \\nallocated to the new project? Again, the answer is no. With or without the new complex, the \\npersonnel department is part of overhead costs. Its operating expenses would only be affected \\nif the planned investment generates additional costs – for example, recruitment expenses.\\nHowever, design and overheads will be priced into the ticket charged for entry to the \\nnew complex.\\nA perfume company is about to launch a new product line that may cut sales of its \\nolder perfumes by half. Should this decline be factored into the calculation of the invest-\\nment’s return? Yes, because the new product line will prompt a shift in consumer behav-\\niour: the decline in cash flow from the older perfume stems directly from the introduction \\nof this new product.'),\n",

Our objective is to calculate the investment’s mar-\\nginal contribution to the company’s proﬁtability.\\nNevertheless, we can mention that in certain very specific sectors with very low marginal \\ncosts, this reasoning may lead to overinvestment creating overcapacity and therefore price \\nwars.\\n3/ REASON IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITY\\nFor financial managers, an asset’s value is its market value, which is the price at which it \\ncan be bought (investment decision) or sold (divestment decision). From this standpoint, \\nits book or historic value is of no interest whatsoever, except for tax purposes (taxes pay-\\nable on book capital gains, tax credit on capital losses, etc.).\\nFor example, if a project is carried out on company land that was previously unused, \\nthe land’s after-tax resale value must be considered when valuing the investment. After \\nall, in principle, the company can choose between selling the land and booking the after-\\ntax sales price, or using the land for the new project. Note that the book value of the land \\ndoes not enter into this line of reasoning.\\nThe opportunity principle boils down to some very simple rules:\\nt if a company decides to hold on to a business, this implies that it should be prepared \\nto buy that business (if it did not already own it) in identical operating circumstances; \\nand\\nt if a company decides to hold on to a financial security that is trading at a given price, \\nthis security is identical to one that it should be prepared to buy (if it did not already \\nown it) at the same price.\\nFinancial managers are, in effect, “asset dealers”.  They must introduce this approach \\nwithin their company, even if it means standing up to other managers who view their \\nrespective business operations as essential and viable. Only by systematically confront-\\ning these two viewpoints can a company balance its decision-making and management \\nprocesses.\\nTheoretically, a financial manager does not view any activity as essential, regardless \\nof whether it is one of the company’s core businesses or a potential new venture. The CFO \\nmust constantly be prepared to question each activity and reason in terms of:\\ntbuying and selling assets; and\\nt entering or withdrawing from an economic sector of activity.\\nIf we push our reasoning to the extreme, we could say that for ﬁnancial managers an \\ninvestment is never a necessity, but simply a “good or bad” opportunity.\\nThe concept of necessity should be interpreted as regards the strategy of the firm, the \\ninvestment is then a tool for achieving this strategy, a necessary tool, hence highly \\nprofitable.'),\n",

Only operating and investment flows are taken into account, but never financ-\\ning flows. This is the same distinction that was made in Chapter 2. Failure to do so would \\nskew the project’s net present value. This would also overstate its IRR, since the impact \\nof financing would be included twice:\\ntfirst, within the weighted average cost of capital for this investment which is its cost \\nof financing; and\\nt second at the cash flow level.\\nConsider, for example, an investment with the following flows:\\nY e a r 0123\\nInvestment ﬂows −100 15 15 115\\nThe NPV of this investment is 7.2 (if cash flows are discounted at 12%) and its IRR is 15%.\\nNow, assume that 20% of the investment was financed by debt at an annual after-tax cost \\nof 6%. Then it is possible to deduct the debt flows from the investment flows and calculate \\nits NPV and IRR:\\nY e a r 0123\\nInvestment ﬂows −100 15.0 15.0 115.0\\nDebt ﬁnancing ﬂows 20 −1.2 −1.2 −21.2\\nNet ﬂows to equity −80 13.8 13.8 93.8\\nWith a rate of 12%, the NPV is 10.1 and the IRR is 17.2%. Now, if 50% of the investment \\nwere financed by debt, the NPV would rise to 14.4 and the IRR to 24%. At 80% debt-\\nfinancing, NPV works out to 18.7 and the IRR to 51%.\\nThis demonstrates that by taking on various degrees of debt, it is possible to manipu-\\nlate the NPV and IRR. This is the same as using the financial leverage that was discussed \\nin Chapter 12. However, this is a slippery slope. It can lead unwary companies to invest in \\nprojects whose low industrial profitability is offset by high debt, which in fact increases \\nthe risk considerably.\\nAll that matters is the investment’s return per se.\\nWhen debt increases, so does the required return on equity as the risk increases for share-\\nholders, as we have seen in Chapter 12. It is not correct to continue valuing NPV at a con-\\nstant discount rate of 12%. The discount rate has to be raised in conjunction with the level \\nof debt. This corrects our reasoning and NPV remains constant. The IRR is now higher, \\nbut the minimum required return has risen as well to reflect the greater degree of risk of \\nan investment financed by borrowings.'),\n",

In \\nfact, the debt is only available because the company has equity that acts as collateral for \\ncreditors. Equity has to be remunerated, and this is not reflected in the 7% interest on the \\ndebt. No company can be fully financed by debt, and it is therefore impossible to establish \\na direct comparison between the cost of debt and the project’s return.\\n5/ CONSIDER TAXATION\\nClearly taxation is an issue because corporate executives endeavour to maximise their \\nafter-tax flows. Consider that:\\nt additional depreciation generates tax savings that must be factored into the equation;\\nt the cash flows generated by the investment give rise to taxes, which must be included \\nas well; and\\nt certain tax shields offer tax credits, rebates, subsidies, allowances and other advan-\\ntages for carrying out investment projects.\\nIn practice, it is better to value a project using after-tax cash flows and an after-tax dis-\\ncount rate in order to factor in the various tax benefits from an investment. Therefore, the \\nreturn required by investors and creditors is calculated after tax.\\nIn cases where cash flows are discounted before tax, it is important to ascertain that \\nall flows and components of weighted average cost of capital are considered before taxes \\nas well.\\nWhen considering an investment, it is also necessary to look at the tax implications.\\n6/ BE CONSISTENT !\\nFinally, the best advice is to always be consistent. If the base of valuation is on constant \\neuro values – that is, excluding inflation – be sure that the discount rate excludes inflation \\nas well. We recommend using current euro values, because the discount rate already \\nincludes the market’s inflation expectations.\\nIf it is a pre-tax valuation, make sure the discount rate reflects the pre-tax required \\nrate of return. We recommend using after-tax valuations because a world without taxes \\nonly exists in textbooks!\\nAnd if flows are denominated in a given currency, the discount rate must correspond \\nto the interest rate in that currency as well.\\nSection 28.3\\nWHICH CASH FLOWS ARE IMPORTANT ?\\nIn practice, three types of cash flow must be considered when assessing an investment: \\noperating flows, investment flows and extraordinary flows. Financial managers try to \\nplan both the amount of a cash flow and its timing. In other words, they draw up projec-\\ntions of the cash flows on the investment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 531}, page_content='VALUE516\\nSECTION 3\\nc28.indd 01:6:36:PM  09/05/2014 Page 516Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\nWhere the investment has a limited life, it is possible to anticipate its cash flows over \\nthe entire period. But, in general, the duration of an investment is not predetermined, \\nand one assumes that at some point in the future it will be either wound up or sold. This  \\nmeans that the financial manager has to forecast all cash flows over a given period with \\nan explicit forecast period, and reason in terms of residual (or salvage) value beyond that \\nhorizon. Although the discounted residual value is frequently very low since it is very far \\noff in time, it should not be neglected. Its book value is generally zero, but its economic \\nvalue may be quite significant since accounting depreciation may differ from economic \\ndepreciation. The residual value reflects the flows extending beyond the explicit invest-\\nment horizon, and on into infinity. If some of the assets may be sold off, one must also \\nfactor in any taxes on capital gains.\\n1/ OPERATING  FLOWS\\nThe investment’s contribution to total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \\namortisation (EBITDA) must be calculated. It represents the difference between the \\nadditional income and expenses arising from the investment, excluding depreciation and \\namortisation.\\nThen from EBITDA, the theoretical tax on the additional operating profit must be \\ndeducted. The actual tax is then calculated by multiplying the effective tax rate with the \\ndifferential on the operating profit, taking into account any tax-loss carryforwards.\\nIn other words:1\\nOperating flows EBITDA EBIT C=− × T\\nwhere Tc is the corporate tax rate.\\n2/ INVESTMENT  FLOWS\\nThe definition of investment is quite inclusive, ranging from investments in working capi-\\ntal to investments in fixed assets.\\nIt is essential to deduct changes in working capital from EBITDA. Unfortunately, \\nmany people tend to forget this. In most cases, working capital is just a matter of a time \\nlag. It builds up gradually, grows with the company and is retrieved when the business \\nis discontinued. A euro capitalised today in working capital can be retrieved in 10 years’ \\ntime, but it will not be worth the same. Money invested in working capital is not lost. It is \\nsimply capitalised until the investment is discontinued. However, this capitalisation car-\\nries a cost, which is reflected in the discounted amount.\\nInvestment in fixed assets comprises investment in production capacity and growth, \\nwhether in the form of tangible assets (machinery, land, buildings, etc.) or intangible \\nassets (research and development, patents and licences, etc.) or financial assets (shares in \\nsubsidiaries) for external growth.\\nThe calculation must be made for each period, as the investment is not necessar-\\nily restricted to just one year, nor spread evenly over the period. Once again, remember \\nthat our approach is based on cash and not accounting data. The investment flows must \\n1 The same \\nresult can be \\nobtained with \\nthe following \\nformula: \\nOperating  \\nﬂows = \\nEBIT× (1 − TC) \\n+ Depreciation \\nand Amortisation'),\n",

However, financial managers frequently know in advance that certain expenses  \\nthat have not been booked under EBITDA (litigation, tax audits, etc.) will be disbursed in the \\nnear future. These expenses must all be included on an after-tax basis in the calculation \\nof estimated free cash flow.\\nExtraordinary flows can usually be anticipated at the beginning of the period since \\nthey reflect known items.

The payback period is thus \\n2–3 years. A linear interpolation gives us a payback period of 2.75 years.\\nOnce the payback period has been calculated, it is compared with an arbitrary cut-off \\ndate determined by the financial manager. If the payback period is longer than the cut-off \\nperiod, the investment should be rejected. Clearly, when the perceived risk on the invest-\\nment is high, the company will look for a very short payback period in order to get its \\nmoney back before it is too late!\\nThe payback ratio is used as an indicator of an investment’s risk and profitability. \\nHowever, it can lead to the wrong decision, as shown in the example below of investments \\nA and B.\\nFlows in \\nperiod 0\\nFlows in \\nperiod 1\\nFlows in \\nperiod 2\\nFlows in \\nperiod 3\\nRecovery \\nwithin\\n20%\\nNPV\\nInvestment A −1000 500 400 600 2 years and \\n2 months\\n42\\nInvestment B −1000 500 500 100 2 years −178\\nThe payback rule would prompt us to choose investment B, even though investment A \\nhas positive NPV , but B does not. The payback rule can be misleading because it does \\nnot take all flows into account. It emphasises the liquidity of an investment rather than \\nits value.\\nMoreover, because it considers that a euro today is worth the same as a euro tomor-\\nrow, the payback rule does not factor in the time value of money. To remedy this, one \\nsometimes calculates a discounted payback period representing the time needed for the \\nproject to have positive NPV . Returning to the example, it then becomes:\\nY e a r 012345\\nCumulative present values −2.1 −1.43 −0.88 −0.41 −0.03 0.29\\nThe discounted payback period is now 4 years compared with 2.6 years before dis-\\ncounting. Discounted or not, the payback period is a risk indicator, since the shorter it is, \\nthe lower the risk of the investment. That said, it ignores the most fundamental aspect \\nof risk: the uncertainty of estimating liquidity flows.  Therefore, it is just an approxi-\\nmate indicator since it only measures liquidity.\\nHowever, the payback ratio is fully suited to productive investments that affect neither \\nthe company’s level of activity nor its strategy. Its very simplicity encourages employees \\nto suggest productivity improvements that can be seen to be profitable without having to \\nperform lengthy calculations. It only requires common sense. However, calculating flows \\nin innovative sectors can be something of a shot in the dark. Also, the payback rule tends \\nto favour investments with a high turnover rate. As a result, it has come under quite a bit \\nof criticism because it can only compare investments that are similar.'),\n",

The computation of ROCE takes into account the after-tax \\noperating profit and capital employed (working capital plus the residual investment after \\ndepreciation).\\nDepreciation plays a detrimental role, as shown in the example below of an initial \\ninvestment of 500 generating annual EBITDA of 433 for five years. With stable working \\ncapital of 500 and a 40% tax rate, the free cash flow projection is as follows:\\n31/12/y y + 1 y + 2 y + 3 y + 4 y + 5\\nEBITDA 433 433 433 433 433\\nTax −133 −133 −133 −133 −133\\nChanges in working capital −500 0 0 0 0 +500\\nInvestment −500\\nFree cash ﬂow −1000 +300 +300 +300 +300 +800\\nThe investment’s IRR works out at 23.75%.

In the first case it averages 29.8% and in the \\nsecond case it is 35%. Do you really believe that just changing an accounting method can \\ninfluence the intrinsic profitability of a project? Of course not, and this example clearly \\nillustrates the flaw inherent in the criteria.\\nAlthough the highest returns are usually obtained on projects with the longest dura-\\ntions, accounting rates of return do not take into account the dates of the flows. Hence, \\nthey generally tend to overstate returns. Another drawback with accounting rates of return \\nis that they maximise rates without considering the corresponding risk.\\nOn the surface, it may seem that there is no connection between return on capital \\nemployed and the internal rate of return. The first discounts flows, while the second cal-\\nculates book wealth. And yet, taken over a year, their outcomes are identical. An amount \\nof 100 that increases to 110 a year later has an IRR of 100 = 110 / (1 + r), so r = 10%, \\nand an ROCE of 10/100, or 10%.\\nROCE and IRR are equal over a given period of time. ROCE is therefore calculated \\nby period, while IRR and NPV are computed for the entire life of the investment.\\nAlthough accounting rates of return should not be used as investment or financ-\\ning criteria, they can be useful financial control tools.\\nSooner or later, a discounted return has to be translated into an accounting rate of \\nreturn. If not, the investment has not generated the anticipated ex-post return and has not \\nachieved its purpose. We strongly advise you to question any differences between IRR \\nand ROCE, i.e. are income flows distributed or retained, do profits arise unevenly over \\nthe period (starting out slowly or not at all and then gathering momentum), what is the \\nterminal value, etc.?\\n3/ CAPITAL  RATIONING  AND  THE  PRESENT  VALUE  INDEX\\nSometimes there is a strict capital constraint imposed on the firm, and it is faced with \\nmore NPV positive projects than it can afford. In order to determine which project to \\npursue, the best formula to use is the present value index (PVI). This is the present value \\nof cash inflows divided by the present value of cash outflow:\\nPVI Present value of inflows\\nPresent value of outflows=\\nBy using the PVI, financial managers can rank the different projects and then select the \\ninvestment with the highest PVI – that is, the project with the highest NPV relative to the \\npresent value of outflows. After making this selection, if the total amount of capital avail-\\nable has not been fully exhausted, the managers should then invest in the project with the \\nsecond-highest PVI, and so on until no more capital remains to invest.\\nMore generally, the objective is to compare all combinations of x projects that meet \\nthe budget and find the one that maximises the weighted average PVI:\\nPVI PV outflows Project\\nTotal funds available PVI PV outfl=× () +…+A\\nA\\noows Project\\nTotal funds available PVIX\\nX×()'),\n",

The cost of capital has to be factored \\ninto investment decisions because it is the rate that is used for discounting cash flows for \\nNPV or comparing with the IRR. Cost of capital is also used to determine enterprise value \\n(see Chapter 31). Truly, its importance can hardly be understated.\\nBut before reading on, it is imperative to understand the distinction between cost of \\ncapital, which is the weighted average cost of the capital contributed to the firm, and the \\ncost of equity, which is just one component of the weighted average of the cost of capital.\\nSection 29.1\\nTHE COST OF CAPITAL AND THE RISK OF ASSETS\\nThe cost of capital is the minimum rate of return on the company’s investments that can \\nsatisfy both shareholders (the cost of equity) and debtholders (the cost of debt). The \\ncost of capital is thus the company’s total cost of ﬁnancing.\\nWhen markets are in equilibrium, any investor with a perfectly diversified portfolio \\nholds a fraction of both the company’s equity and its debt. This is known as the CAPM, as \\nwas discussed in Chapter 19. In other words, each investor holds a share of the company’s \\noperating assets, since this is equal to the sum of equity and net debt. Accordingly, each \\ninvestor has some exposure to the risk arising from the company.\\nThe rate of return required by investors thus depends on just one factor: the risk \\narising from the assets-in-place . This means that the cost of the company’s financial \\nresources – its cost of capital – is none other than the rate of return required by investors, \\nwhich is a function of the risk on capital employed.\\nThe cost of capital depends solely on the risk of the assets-in-place, speciﬁcally its \\nsystematic risk, since unsystematic or speciﬁc risks are not remunerated.\\nThe cost of capital is thus shaped by the economic characteristics of each sector of activity:\\ntThe cost structure (fixed vs. variable costs): the higher the fixed costs (in the cement, \\nor sea freight sectors for example), the more sensitive the firm is to the economic \\nenvironment and the higher its cost of capital.'),\n",

This is the case for transportation or civil works \\n(high economic risk and hence cost of capital). Other sectors absorb downturns; this \\nis the case for the basic food industry.\\nt The predictability of the activity: between a real estate operator benefiting from \\nlong-term rents and a combat aircraft manufacturer, there is quite some differ-\\nence in terms of predictability of revenues and cash flows. Their cost of capi-\\ntal will significantly differ: low for the real estate operator, high for the aircraft \\nmanufacturer.\\nt The results growth rates: the higher the growth of future results, the higher the cost of \\ncapital. In such cases, the bulk of the enterprise value is due to cash flows which are \\ndistant in time and therefore quite sensitive to market fluctuations.\\nModigliani and Miller (1958) and Miller (1977)1 were the first to state that the com-\\npany’s cost of capital is not a function of its capital structure.\\nIf the risk on capital employed is such that it requires a 12% rate of return, and if it is \\nfully equity-financed, shareholders will expect a minimum 12% return. On the other hand, \\nif it is fully debt-financed, creditors will again require a 12% rate of return since they \\nincur the same risk with the operating assets as the shareholders in the previous example. \\nLastly, suppose financing is equally divided between debt and equity. If the cost of debt is \\n10%, then shareholders will require a 14% return on equity to achieve a weighted average \\nof 12%, i.e. the remuneration justified by the 12% risk for capital employed or the cost \\nof capital.\\nAssume that, in a perfect market, the company changes its capital structure – for \\nexample, by buying back some of its equity via the issue of new debt. In this case, an \\ninvestor with a perfectly diversified portfolio who holds 1% of the company’s equity and \\n1% of its debt and thus 1% of its capital employed will continue to hold 1% of capital \\nemployed, though now with a lower amount of equity because of the share buy-back and \\na higher percentage of net debt. The transaction is thus totally neutral for the investor. It \\nwill not affect the cost of capital, even if it is now divided between the cost of debt and the \\ncost of equity, because the risk on capital employed remains unchanged.\\nAs we have already discussed, the cost of capital is equal to the weighted average \\ncosts of net debt and of net equity. This will be examined in greater detail in the next \\nsection.\\nThe cost of capital is not the weighted average of two separate costs. The overall riski-\\nness of the company is represented by the cost of capital, whose two key components \\nare debt and equity. The costs of equity and debt are a function of the risk of the assets, \\nthe cost of overall capital, and the respective weighting of each.\\nFor purely practical reasons, however, the cost of capital is calculated by taking the costs \\nof debt and equity together.\\nSection 29.2\\nALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THE COST OF CAPITAL\\nThe cost of capital can be calculated in three ways: directly, indirectly or via enterprise \\nvalue.\\n1  See Chapters \\n32 and 33.'),\n",

It is all too easy to reduce the cost of capital on paper \\nby increasing the relative share of net debt, because debt is always cheaper than equity!\\nIn the preceding example, if the share of debt is increased to 80% without changing \\neither the cost of debt or equity, then the cost of capital works out to be 4.6%.

Instead, it is the rate of return currently required by shareholders as measured \\nby the CAPM:\\nkr r rEF EM F=+ × − ()β\\nThe cost of debt is not the cost of debt contracted 10 years, one year or three months ago. \\nNor is it the company’s average cost of debt or the ratio of financial expenses to average \\ndebt for the year, as studied in Chapter 12, which covered the nominal cost of debt.\\nThe cost of net debt is the rate at which the company could reﬁnance its existing debt \\ngiven its present economic position. It cannot be lower than the risk-free rate.\\n(b) Accounting or market values of equity and debt?\\nShareholders base their required rate of return on the market value of equity; that is, the \\namount at which equity can be bought or sold, rather than using book values. The same \\nreasoning applies to debtholders.\\nThe choice of weighting is based on market values rather than book values.\\nThis is consistent with the idea of selecting the required rate of return rather than the book \\nrate of return. Using the book value of liabilities can be very misleading because it may \\nsignificantly differ from the market value of equity and debt.\\nThe yield to maturity shown in bond quotations in the financial press is based on the \\nclosing market price of a bond, not on its face value. Similarly, the implied cost of equity \\nfor a company’s cost should be based on the market price per share at which it trades.\\nFor example, the Nestlé shareholder does not require a 16% 3 return on book equity \\nof CHF 62.6bn, but a 6.3% return on market capitalisation of CHF 212bn! Similarly, an \\ninvestor buying Deutsche Telekom bonds with a nominal yield of 9.25% at a price of 155% \\nof the nominal amount does not require a 9.25% return. Instead, he is looking for 4.88%.4\\nSection 29.3\\nSOME  PRACTICAL  APPLICATIONS\\n1/ FOR THE  INVESTMENT  DECISION\\nWhen making an investment decision, and even if using the indirect method, it is not par-\\nticularly difficult to calculate the cost of capital. If the company is publicly listed, the cal-\\nculation is based on readily available market data. Average prices are often used to smooth \\nout any erratic market swings. If the company is not listed, the calculation is based on the \\ncost of capital of companies of comparable size and risk operating in the same sector of \\nactivity. If the peer sample has been well chosen, the resulting cost of capital will be the \\nsame as that of the unlisted company.\\n4  Discounted \\nrate of return on \\na bond listed at \\n155%.\\n3  Book return \\non 2013 equity.'),\n",

The two are the same only if the risk level of the project is \\nthe same as that of the firm.\\nIf the company is engaging in a greenfield project (e.g. a new oil field for an oil com-\\npany), it should add to its cost of capital a premium of c.2%.\\nThe level or risk of a project can also evolve in time. Usually the average W ACC over \\nthe duration of the project will be retained. But it may be more accurate to use a different \\nW ACC for each period depending on the maturity and therefore the risk of the investment.\\nIf the company invests in a new sector or a new geography, it will not be able to use \\nthe cost of capital of the firm to assess the project. The risk of the project will have to \\nbe taken into account to determine the cost of capital to be used. The cost of capital will \\ntherefore reflect the industry and geographic risk of the project.\\nThe cost of the funds that will be used to finance the project should never be treated \\nas the cost of capital. \\nIf the project is financed by debt, the cost of capital to be used will be higher, as the \\ncost of debt takes into account that the firm has equity to secure the repayment of the debt. \\nAlternatively, if the project is financed by new equity, the cost of capital to be used \\nis likely to be lower as the higher overall equity will make it possible to reduce the risk \\nborne by debt (and equity) holders.\\nOne should not mix up the cost of ﬁnancing of a project with its cost of capital. The cost \\nof ﬁnancing will most likely depend on the overall ﬁnancial health of the ﬁrm whereas \\nthe cost of capital will only depend on the risk of the project.\\nRetaining the cost of the financing source directly instead of the cost of capital will lead \\nto erroneous investment choices as illustrated by the following example:\\nLet’s take a first investment with an IRR of 8% to be financed with equity that yields \\na cost of 10%. As the return of the investment does not cover its cost of financing, it is \\nrejected.\\nA second investment with a similar risk has an IRR of 6%, it is to be financed with \\ndebt costing 4%. This investment will then be undertaken as its return is above the cost \\nof financing.\\nAs a result, this reasoning has led the company to undertake the investment yielding \\nthe lower return (6% vs. 8%) for the same level of risk. This clearly shows that the reason-\\ning is incorrect. \\n2/ FOR VALUATION\\nThe indirect method is less adapted to valuations, because to determine the value of equity \\none needs the cost of capital (see Chapter 31), and to calculate the cost of capital one \\nneeds the cost of equity! However, there are three ways to solve this dilemma:\\ntuse the parameters associated with a target capital structure, while being careful \\nto use the costs of equity and net debt that correspond to the target capital structure, \\nand not the present costs;\\nt state the equation of the value of equity (knowing that you need the value of \\nequity to derive the discount rate) and find, by successive approximation, the discount '),\n",

Excel does iterative calculations that will solve this issue. Some other \\npractitioners first use a very rough estimate of the value of equity (derived by the \\ncomparables method, for example) and then refine their calculation depending on \\nthe results.\\nt use the direct method. The advantage of this alternative is that one avoids the fre-\\nquent mistake of using costs of equity and debt that do not correspond to the capital \\nstructure in question. \\n3/ DIVERSIFIED COMPANIES\\nThe overall cost of capital of a diversified company can be calculated similarly to a com-\\npany with a single business. Conversely, the analyst should be cautious if the divisions \\ndo not show the same risk profile. In these cases, each division should be analysed sepa-\\nrately according to its cost of capital; the weighted average costs of capital of different \\ndivisions would then represent the overall cost of capital for the company. As shown in \\nChapter\\xa031, diversification does not reduce the cost of capital because it only considers \\nsystematic risk. As unsystematic risk can be eliminated by diversification; it does not \\naffect the required rate of return.\\n4/ MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES\\nA similar logic applies to companies operating in different countries. \\nA British company investing in Russia, for example, should not use a discount rate \\nbased on British data just because its suppliers of funds are British. \\nAfter all, the project’s flows are affected by the Russian systematic risks (inflation, \\ntaxation, exchange rates, etc.) rather than the British systematic risk. Therefore, the com-\\npany should correctly apply a beta reflecting the project’s sensitivity to Russian systematic \\nrisk.\\nAfter the West-based company has invested in Russia, its cost of capital will probably \\nbe higher. The difference would be made up of two costs, a lower one for Western Europe \\nand a higher one for Russia, reflecting the different levels of systemic risk (political and \\nmacroeconomic) in the two regions.\\nThis approach avoids the frequent error of discounting flows denominated in one cur-\\nrency using discount rates denominated in another currency.\\n5/ EMERGING MARKETS\\nIn developing countries, calculating the cost of capital of an investment raises some \\npractical problems. The risk-free rate of local government bonds is often just wishful \\nthinking, since these countries have little solvency. The local risk-free rate and betas of \\nlocal peer groups are rarely measured, let alone significant, given the limited size of finan-\\ncial markets in these countries.'),\n",

This yield represents the political risk in the emerging country. When \\nthe developing nation has not made any international issues, it is possible to use a bond \\nissue by another state with the same credit rating as a benchmark.\\nWhen the sovereign spread reflects the fact that the state cannot be considered a risk-\\nfree borrower (like Ukraine in mid-2014), we advise using the spread of the best-rated \\nborrower.\\nβA is the beta coefficient of the sector of activity calculated in developed financial \\nmarkets. This parameter measures the sensitivity of an industry’s flows to the overall eco-\\nnomic environment. It is shaped by the sector of activity, not the country.\\nObviously, this rate must be applied to flows that have been converted from their \\nlocal currencies into euros. If the flows are denominated in dollars, then remember to \\napply a USD rather than a euro benchmark.\\nFor example, it is possible to calculate the cost of capital of a South African invest-\\nment project based on the following assumptions: βA = 0.82, rF in the US = 2.1%, a South \\nAfrican government bond rate of 3.9% (bonds denominated in USD), a US risk premium \\nof 6.9%:\\nIf the project’s flows are denominated in South African Rands, the cost of capital is con-\\nverted from dollars into rands as follows:\\n2.1% \\n+ 3.9% − 2.1%\\n+ 0.82 × 6.9%\\n= 9.6% on ﬂows denominated in dollars\\ncost of capital in rands cost of capital in dollars\\ninf= +\\n+\\n1\\n1 llation rate in dollars\\ninflation rate in rands1\\n1\\n+\\n−\\nThis assumes that the rand devaluates against the dollar regularly in line with the inflation \\nrate differential (purchase power ratio).'),\n",

In other words, the risk on the share is lower than the risk on the company given the \\nstructurally positive net cash balance.\\nThe cost of capital of this company can be estimated using the indirect method apply-\\ning a negative value for VD. So, in this example, if the cost of equity is 7% and net cash \\ngenerates 2% after taxes: \\nk =× − +× −\\n− =7% 9\\n92 2% 2\\n92 8.4%\\nTo offer the 7% return required by shareholders, the company would have to invest in \\nprojects yielding at least 8.4%. The 7% cost of equity is the weighted average of the \\nrequired 8.4% return on capital employed and the 2% on net cash.\\nThe company’s cost of capital is thus 8.4%.\\nThe cost of capital for a company with a structurally positive cash balance does not \\ndiffer from that of a company with the same capital employed but no cash. The cost of \\nequity changes, but the cost of capital remains the same.\\nPractitioners often use a cost of capital equal to the cost of equity when the firm holds net \\ncash. This is a mistake unless you consider that shareholders do not take into account the \\nsecurity brought by the net cash.\\n7/ COMPANIES  IN FINANCIAL  DISTRESS\\nIt is generally assumed that companies under financial distress have a very high cost of \\ncapital. This is not correct! Bankruptcy risk is a specific risk and not a systematic risk, \\nand it should therefore not be taken into account by the cost of capital. If things were not \\nso, the firm in financial distress could never undertake an investment as it would require a \\nhigher return than other firms in the sector. It could then never recover.\\nThe cost of capital for a company in ﬁnancial distress is identical to that for a company \\nin the same sector that has no difﬁculties.\\nOn the other hand its cost of equity will be very high (equity β as high as 10 can be \\nobserved) as the value of equity has become negligible compared to the value of debt.

While net debt costs less than equity, it tends to increase \\nthe risk to shareholders, who retaliate by raising the required rate of return and conse-\\nquently the cost of equity. Debt works to the advantage of the company, because the inter-\\nest on the net debt can be deducted from its tax base (which it cannot do for dividends). \\nThe opposite tends to apply to investors.\\nIn short, in a perfect world in which investors had diversified portfolios, one man’s \\ngain would be another man’s loss.\\nMoreover, if debt really did reduce the cost of capital, one would have to wonder why \\nhighly efficient companies, such as Rolls-Royce, Swatch Group, Toyota, Google and SAP \\nare not levered, given that they have no reason to fear bankruptcy.\\nSince the cost of capital depends on the risk to the company, the only way it can be \\nlowered is through risk-reducing measures, such as: \\ntLowering the breakeven point by shifting from fixed to variable costs, i.e. sub-\\ncontracting, outsourcing, etc. Unfortunately, the margins will probably decline \\naccordingly.\\nt Improving the business’s visibility and smoothing its cyclical nature, i.e. win-\\nning medium-term supply contracts with important clients. Here too, however, \\nmargins may be affected since, in exchange, the clients will demand price \\nconcessions.\\nt Diversifying the business does not help as it does not reduce market risk, but rather \\nspecific risk, which is the only one to be remunerated.\\nt Shifting from a risky activity (e.g. a biotech startup) in a high-risk country like \\nPakistan to a safer business in a more stable country (cheese production in Swit-\\nzerland), will no doubt cut the cost of capital, but it will also lower profitability. In \\naddition, it would have no impact on value, since it is simply a lateral move in the \\nmarket.\\nIn conclusion, managers have virtually no means of lowering the cost of capital while \\nsimultaneously creating value. Their only viable strategy is to improve the return on \\ncapital employed by increasing ﬂows and reducing the amount of capital employed.\\nSimilarly, increasing the risk for capital employed increases the cost of capital, but value \\nwill not be destroyed if profitability improves at the same time.\\nThe cost of capital of Bouygues increased as it launched media and telecom activities \\n(riskier than its traditional construction operations) and then decreased as these operations \\nmatured.'),\n",

It is relied on for making investment decisions and for the valuation \\nof businesses.\\nThe cost of capital is not just the risk of capital employed. It exists before the capital struc-\\nture is even fully assembled or ﬁnalised. In fact, creditors and shareholders will determine \\nthe rate of return they require on debt and equity on the basis of the capital structure and \\nof the risk of capital employed.\\nOnly for calculation purposes is the cost of capital often calculated as the weighted average \\ncost of equity and debt.\\nThe cost of capital can be calculated by:\\n t using a direct method on the basis of the β of the capital employed; or\\n t using an indirect method where it is equal to the weighted average of the values of the \\ncost of equity and the cost of net debt; or\\n t observing the value of capital employed, when this ﬁgure is available.\\nFor a diversiﬁed company, there are as many costs of capital as there are sectors in which it \\noperates. Similarly, every country or economic area has its own speciﬁc cost of capital, which \\nis dependent upon the political landscape and macroeconomic risks.\\nFor emerging countries, the methodology must be adapted to factor in both the lack of cer-\\ntain data (risk-free interest rate) and international parameters (the industry’s β).\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

On its own, this technique does \\nnot take into account the many factors of uncertainty arising from industrial investments. \\nAttempting to predict the future is too complicated (if not impossible!) to be done using \\nmathematical criteria alone.\\nAccordingly, investors have developed a number of risk analysis techniques whose \\ncommon objective is to know more about a project than just the information provided by \\nthe NPV . Nonetheless, these traditional approaches to risk analysis suffer from an impor-\\ntant shortcoming: they don’t consider the value of flexibility . Recently, options theory \\nvis-à-vis investment decisions has begun to allow investors to assess some new concepts \\nthat are crucial to investment analysis.\\nSection 30.1\\nASSESSING RISK THROUGH THE BUSINESS PLAN\\n1/ BUILDING A BUSINESS PLAN\\nThe reader must realise that the business plan is the first stage in assessing the risks related \\nto an investment. The purpose of the business plan is to model the firm’s most probable \\nfuture and it helps to identify the parameters that could significantly impact on a project’s \\nvalue. For example, in certain industries where sales prices are not very important, the \\nmodel will be based on gross margins, which are more stable than turnover.\\nEstablishing a business plan helps to determine the project’s dependence upon factors \\nover which investors have some influence, such as costs and/or sales price. It also outlines \\nthose factors that are beyond investors’ control, such as raw material prices, exchange \\nrates, etc. Obviously, the more the business plan depends upon exogenous factors, the \\nriskier it becomes.'),\n",

This is done by holding all other assumptions fixed and \\nthen applying the present value to each different economic assumption. It is a technique \\nthat highlights the consequences of changes in prices, volumes, rising costs or additional\\ninvestments on the value of projects.\\nA recent study shows that generally firms build three scenarios (pessimistic, realistic \\nand optimistic). In certain sectors highly dependent on raw materials or other exogenous \\nfactors (such as the price of electricity), investment scenarios are deducted from predeter-\\nmined macroeconomic scenarios. \\nThe sensitivity analysis requires a good understanding of the sector of activity and \\nits specific constraints. The industrial analysis must be rounded off with a more financial \\nanalysis of the investment’s sensitivity to the model’s technical parameters, such as the \\ndiscount rate or terminal value (growth rate to infinity, see Chapter 31).\\nPractitioners usually build a sensitivity matrix, which offers an overview of the \\nsensitivity of the investment’s NPV to the various assumptions.\\nOther companies prefer to focus on only one scenario that is analysed in depth in \\norder to keep managers of the project committed.\\n3/ ASSESSMENT OF THE MAXIMUM RISK\\nThe investor, in particular if he is not familiar with the sector (which is usually the case \\nof financial investors) may be tempted to build a very pessimistic scenario (worst-case \\nscenario or crash test). Nevertheless, this scenario needs to remain realistic and cannot be \\na cumulative sensitivity analysis.\\nThis exercise does not aim to determine a value but rather to assess the risk of failure \\n(and potentially bankruptcy) of the project or to assess the additional investments that \\nwould then be needed. This scenario can also be useful to fix the maximum level of debt \\nthat the project can take.\\nSection 30.2\\nASSESSING RISK THROUGH A MATHEMATICAL APPROACH\\n1/ MONTE CARLO SIMULATION\\nAn even more elaborate variation of scenario analysis is the Monte Carlo simulation ,\\nwhich is based on more sophisticated mathematical tools and software. It consists of \\nisolating a number of the project’s key variables or value drivers, such as turnover or \\nmargins, and allocating a probability distribution to each. The analyst enters all the \\nassumptions about distributions of possible outcomes into a spreadsheet. The model then \\nrandomly samples from a table of predetermined probability distributions in order to \\nidentify the probability of each result.\\nAssigning probabilities to the investment’s key variables is done in two stages. First, \\ninfluential factors are identified for each key variable. For example, with turnover, the '),\n",

The results of the Monte Carlo method are not as clear cut as \\n present value, and a lot depends upon the risk/reward tradeoff that the investor is will-\\ning to accept. One important limitation of the method is the analysis of interdependence \\nof the key variables; for example, how developments in costs are related to those in  \\nturnover.\\n2/ THE CERTAINTY  EQUIVALENT\\nThe certainty equivalent of a future cash flow is the certain amount that the  investor \\nwould be ready to accept in exchange of an expected future risky cash flow. For exam-\\nple, if the investor is expecting a project to provide a 1,000 cash flow in one year; \\ngiven the risk he may consider trading this cash flow for the certainty of getting 600 in  \\none year.\\nThe certainty equivalent method leads to discounting using the risk-free rate and \\nthe certainty equivalent cash flows. The net present value of an investment can then be  \\nwritten as:\\nNPV CF eC F\\nr\\nii\\nF\\ni\\ni\\nn\\n=+ ×\\n+=\\n∑0\\n1 1()\\nWhere ei is the certainty equivalent factor of cash flow CFi and rF the risk-free rate.\\nThis method remains rarely used in practice.\\nSection 30.3\\nTHE  CONTRIBUTION  OF REAL  OPTIONS\\n1/ THE LIMITS  OF  CONVENTIONAL  ANALYSIS\\nDo not be confused by the variety of risk analysis techniques presented in the preceding \\nsection. In fact, all of these different techniques are based on the same principle. In the \\nfinal analysis, simulations, the Monte Carlo or the certainty equivalent methods are just \\ncomplex variations on the NPV criteria presented in Chapter 16.'),\n",

Assuming that an \\ninvestment is irreversible disregards the fact that corporate managers, once they get \\nnew information, generally have a number of options. They can abandon the invest-\\nment halfway through if the project does not work out, they can postpone part of it or \\nextend it if it has good development prospects, or they can use new technologies. The \\nteams managing or implementing the projects constantly receive new information and \\ncan adapt to changing circumstances. In other words, the conventional approach to \\ninvestment decisions ignores a key feature of many investment projects, namely \\nflexibility.\\nIt might be argued that the uncertainty of future flows has already been factored in \\nvia the mathematical hope criterion 1 and the discount rate, and therefore this should be \\nenough to assess any opportunities to transform a project. However, it can be demon-\\nstrated that this is not necessarily so.\\nThe discount rate and concept of mathematical hope quantify the direct consequences of \\nrandom events. However, they do not take into account the manager’s ability to change \\nstrategies in response to these events.\\n2/ REAL OPTIONS\\nIndustrial managers are not just passively exposed to risks. In many cases, they are \\nable to react to ongoing events . They can increase, reduce or postpone their invest-\\nment, and they exercise this right according to ongoing developments in prospective \\nreturns.\\nIn fact, the industrial manager is in the same situation as the financial manager who \\ncan increase or decrease his position in a security given predetermined conditions.\\nIndustrial managers who have some leeway in managing an investment project are in \\nthe same position as financial managers holding an option.2\\nThe flexibility of an investment thus has a value that is not reflected in conventional \\nanalysis. This value is simply that of the attached option.  Obviously, this option \\ndoes not take the form of the financial security with which you have already become \\nfamiliar. It has no legal existence. Instead, it relates to industrial assets and is called a \\nreal option.\\nReal options relate to industrial investments. They represent the right, but not the \\nobligation, to change an investment project, particularly when new information on its \\nprospective returns becomes available.\\nThe potential flexibility of an investment, and therefore of the attached real options, is \\nnot always easy to identify. Industrial investors frequently do not realise or do not want \\nto admit (especially when using a traditional investment criterion) that they do have some \\nmargin for manoeuvre. This is why it is often called a hidden option.\\n1 The mathemat-\\nical hope is the \\nexpected value, \\ni.e. the sum of \\nthe products of \\nthe value of each \\nevent and the \\nprobability of \\neach event.\\n2 If you are not \\nfamiliar with \\noptions, we \\nadvise you to \\nread Chapter 23 \\nbefore reading \\nthe rest of this \\nchapter.'),\n",

But the specific features of option contracts \\nmust not be overlooked. The following three factors are necessary to ensure that an invest-\\nment project actually offers real options:\\ntThe project must have a degree of uncertainty. The higher the underlying volatility, \\nthe greater the value of an option. If the standard deviation of the flows on a project \\nis low, the value of the options will be negligible.\\nt Investors must be able to get more information during the course of the project, and \\nthis information must be sufficiently precise to be useful.\\nt Once the new information has been obtained, it must be possible to change the project\\nsignificantly and irrevocably. If the industrial manager cannot use the additional \\ninformation to modify the project, he does not really have an option but is simply \\ntaking a chance. In addition, the initial investment decision must also have a certain \\ndegree of irreversibility. If it can be changed at no cost, then the option has no value. \\nAnd lastly, since the value of a real option stems from the investor’s ability to take \\naction, any increase in investment flexibility generates value, since it can give rise \\nto new options or increase the value of existing options.\\nReal options apply primarily to decisions to invest or divest, but they can appear at any \\nstage of a company’s development. As a result, the review in this text of options theory is \\na broad outline, and the list of the various categories of real options is far from exhaustive.\\nThe option to launch a new project  corresponds to a call option on a new busi-\\nness. Its strike price is the start-up investment, a component that is very important in the \\nvaluation for many companies. In these cases, they are not valued on their own merits, \\nbut according to their ability to generate new investment opportunities, even though the \\nnature and returns are still uncertain.\\nA good example of this principle is publishers who own digital rights. Since the \\nbusiness model of ebooks is still uncertain and the corresponding development costs are \\nhigh, the value to a publisher is partly based on anticipated changes within the new digital \\nmarket in which the publisher operates. But the value also includes an option to develop \\nin the new digital market, which still remains to be defined.\\nSimilarly, R&D departments can be considered to be generators of real options \\nembedded within the company. Any innovation represents the option to launch a new \\nproject or product. This is particularly true in the pharmaceutical industry. If the project \\nis not profitable, this does not mean that the discovery has no value. It simply means that the \\ndiscovery is out of the money. Yet this situation could change with further developments.\\nThe option to develop or extend the business is comparable to the launch of a new \\nproject. However, during the initial investment phase decisions have to be made, such as \\nwhether to build a large factory to meet potentially strong demand or just a small plant to \\nfirst test the waters.\\nA real options solution would be to build a small factory with an option to extend it \\nif necessary. Flexibility is just as important in current operations as it is when deciding '),\n",

Investments should be judged by their ability to offer \\nrecurring options throughout their lifecycle. Certain power stations, for example, can eas-\\nily be adapted to run on coal or oil. This flexibility enhances their value, because they can \\nbe easily switched to a cheaper source of energy if prices fluctuate. Similarly, some auto \\nplants need only a few adjustments in order to start producing different models.\\nThe option to reduce or contract business  is the opposite of the previous exam-\\nple. If the market proves smaller than expected, the investor can decide to cut back on \\nproduction, thus reducing the corresponding variable costs. Indeed, he can also decide not \\nto carry out part of the initial project, such as building a second plant. The implied sales \\nprice of the unrealised portion of the project consists of the savings on additional invest-\\nments. This option can be described as a put option on a fraction of the project, even if the \\ninvestment never actually materialises.\\nThe option to postpone a project. The initial investment in the rights of an oil field \\nis minimal in comparison with prospecting and extraction costs. It can thus be quite useful \\nto defer the start of the project, for example until the business environment becomes more \\npropitious (oil prices, operating costs, etc.). To a certain extent, this is similar to holding \\na well-known but not fully exploited brand.\\nThere is a certain time value in delaying the realisation of a project, since in the mean-\\ntime better information about the project’s income and expenses may become available. \\nThis enables a better assessment of the potential for value creation.\\nNonetheless, the option to defer the project’s start is valid only if the investor is able to \\nsecure ownership of the project from the outset. If not, his competitors may take on the \\nproject. In other words, the advantage of deferring the investment could be cancelled out \\nby the risk of new market entrants.\\nLooking beyond the investment decision itself, option models can be used to deter-\\nmine the optimal date for starting up a project. In this case, the waiting period is simi-\\nlar to holding an American option on the project. The option’s value corresponds to the \\nprice of ensuring future ownership of the project (land, patents, licence, etc.).\\nThe option to defer progress on the project  is a continuation of the previous \\nexample. Some projects consist of a series of investments rather than just one initial \\ninvestment. Should investors receive information casting doubt on a project that has \\nalready been launched, they may decide to put subsequent investments on hold, thus \\neffectively halting further development. In fact, investors hold an option on the project’s \\nfurther development at every call for more financing.\\nThe option to abandon  means that the industrial manager can decide to abandon \\nthe project at any time. Thus, hanging on to it today means keeping open the option to \\nabandon at a later date. However, the reverse is not possible. This asymmetry is reflected \\nin options theory, which assumes that a manager can sell his project at any time (but might \\nnot be able to buy it back once it is sold).\\nSuch situations are analogous to the options theory of equity valuations that we will \\nexamine in Chapter 34. If the project is set up as a levered company, the option to abandon \\ncorresponds to shareholders’ right to default. The value of this option is equal to that of \\nequity, and it is exercised when the amount of outstanding debt is greater than the value \\nof the project.\\nIn the example below, the project includes an option to defer its launch (wait and see), \\nan option to expand if it proves successful and an option to abandon it completely.'),\n",

How appealing! It tells us that the \\nhigher the underlying volatility, and thus the risk, the greater the value of an option. This \\nappears counterintuitive compared with the net present value approach, but remember that \\nthis value is very unstable. The time value of an option decreases as it reaches its exercise \\ndate, since the uncertainty declines with the accumulation of information on the environment.\\nThe uncertainty inherent in the ﬂexibility of an industrial project creates value, because \\nthe unknown represents risk that has a time value. As time passes, this uncertainty \\ndeclines as the discounted cash ﬂows are adjusted with new information. The uncer-\\ntainty is replaced with an intrinsic value that progressively incorporates the ever-chang-\\ning expectations.\\nConsider the case of a software publisher who is offered the opportunity to buy a licence \\nto market cell phone software for £5m. If the publisher does not accept the deal right \\naway, the licence will be offered to a rival. The software can be produced on the spot at \\na cost of £50m.\\nIf the software is produced immediately, the company should be able to generate £2m \\nin cash flows over the next year. The situation the following year, however, is far more \\nuncertain, since one of the main telephone carriers is due to choose a new technological \\nstandard. If the standard chosen corresponds to that of the licence offered to our company, \\nit can hope to generate a cash flow of £9m per year.

The management of our company estimates there is a \\n50% chance that the “right” standard will be chosen. As of the second year, the flows are \\nexpected to be constant to infinity.\\nThe present value of the immediate launch of the product can easily be estimated \\nwith a discount rate of 10%. The anticipated flows are 0.5 x 9 + 0.5 x 1 = £5m from the \\nsecond year on to infinity. Assuming that the first year’s flows are disbursed (or received) \\nimmediately, the present value is 5/0.1 + 2 = £52m for a total cost of 50 + 5 = £55m. \\nAccording to the NPV criteria, the project destroys £3m in value and the company should \\nreject the licensing offer. \\nThis would be a serious mistake!\\nIf it buys the licence, the company can decide to produce the software whenever it \\nwants to and can easily wait a year before investing in production. While this means giving \\nup revenues of £2m in the first year, the company will have the advantage of knowing which \\nstandard the telephone operator will have chosen. It can thus decide to produce only if the \\nstandard is suited to its product. If it is not, the company abandons the project and saves \\non development costs. The licence offered to the company thus includes a real option: the \\ncompany is entitled to earn the flows on the project in exchange for investing in production.\\nThe NPV approach assumes that the project will be launched immediately. That corre-\\nsponds to the immediate exercise of the call option on the underlying instrument. This exercise \\ndestroys the time value. To assess the real value of the licence, we have to work out the value \\nof the corresponding real option, i.e. the option of postponing development of the software.\\nWhen a company has a real option, using NPV or any other traditional investment criteria \\nimplies that it will exercise its option immediately. It is important to keep in mind that \\nthis is not necessarily the best solution or the only reality that the company/investor \\nfaces.\\nThe value of an option can be determined by the binomial method, which we described in \\ngreater detail in Chapter 23.\\nImagine that the company has bought the licence and put off producing the software \\nfor a year. It now knows what standard the carrier has chosen. If the standard suits its pur-\\nposes, it can immediately start up production at an NPV of 9 × (1 + 1/0.1) − 50 = £49m \\nat that date. If the wrong standard is chosen, the NPV of developing the software falls to  \\n1 × (1 + 1/0.1) − 50 = −£39m, and the company drops the project (this investment is \\nirreversible and has no hidden options). The value of the real option attached to the licence \\nis thus £49m for a favourable outcome and 0 for an unfavourable outcome. Using a risk-\\nfree discount rate of 5%, the calculation for the initial value of the option is £20.7m, since:\\nCalculation for the initial value of the option\\nCurrent value of the option = 0.56 ×  47.6 –                 = 20.711\\n1 + 5%\\n= 1 ×  1 +             = 11 1\\n10%\\n9 ×  1 +             = 991\\n10% δ =               = 0.5649 – 0\\n99 – 11\\nMax (0; 11 – 50) = 0\\nMax (0; 99 – 50) = 49\\n= 47.650\\n1 + 5%\\nOption value\\nValue of the underlying asset '),\n",

The licence costs £5m and the value of the real \\noption is £20.7m assuming development is postponed for one year. With this proviso, the \\ncompany has been offered the equivalent of an immediate gain of 20.7 − 5 = £15.7m.\\nIn this example, the difference between the two approaches is considerable. Leg-\\nend has it that when an oil concession was once being auctioned off, one of the bidding \\ncompanies offered a price that was less than a tenth of that of its competitor, quite simply \\nbecause he had “forgotten” to factor in the real options!\\nThis example assumed just one binomial alternative but, when attempting to quantify \\nthe value of real options in an investment, one is faced by a myriad of alternatives. More \\ngenerally, the binomial model uses the replicating portfolio approach that requires the use \\nof quite sophisticated mathematical tools. Estimating volatility is always a problematic \\nissue with respect to the concrete application of this methodology. In addition, the method \\nrequires defining a convenience yield that represents the interest in holding an asset at a \\ncertain point in time given its expected return.\\nIn practice, the information derived from the quantification of real options is \\nfrequently not very significant when compared with a highly positive NPV in the initial \\nscenario. However, when NPV is negative at the outset, one always has to consider the \\nflexibility of the project by resorting to real options.\\n5/ THE EXPANDED NET PRESENT VALUE\\nSince options allow us to analyse the various risks and opportunities arising from an \\ninvestment, the project can be assessed as a whole. This is done by taking into account its \\ntwo components – anticipated flows and real options. Some authors call this the expanded\\nnet present value (ENPV), which is the opposite of the “passive” NPV of a project with \\nno options. ENPV is equal to the NPV grossed up with the value or real options of the \\ninvestment.\\nWhen a project is very complex with several real options, the various options cannot \\nbe valued separately since they are often conditional and interdependent. If the option \\nto abandon the project is exercised, the option to reduce business obviously no longer \\nexists and its value is nil. As a result, there is no additional value on options that are \\ninterdependent.\\n6/ CONCLUSION\\nThe predominant appeal of real options theory is its factoring of the value of flexibility \\nthat the traditional approaches ignore. The traditional net present value approach assumes \\nthat there is only one possible outcome. It does not take into account possible adaptive \\nactions that could be taken by corporate managers. Real options fill this gap.\\nBut do not get carried away; applying this method can be quite difficult because:\\nt not everyone knows how to use the mathematical models. This can create problems \\nin communicating findings; and\\nt estimating some of the required parameters, such as volatility, opportunity costs, etc. \\ncan be complicated.'),\n",

In turn, these can be \\nused to justify the unjustiﬁable, e.g. stock prices during the Internet bubble in 2000 or \\n3G licences in 2001.

In this manner, the analyst \\nmust make some effort in estimating which variables move together as well as the intensity \\nof their relationship. Using the Monte Carlo method, a better idea of the prospects of ﬂows \\ncan be obtained by allocating a probability distribution to each of them. Although powerful, \\nthe method is not so easy to interpret and can be misused.\\nThe limitations of all these methods become evident when project managers are able to use \\nnew information to modify a project that is already underway, i.e. when there is a certain \\namount of ﬂexibility. In such cases, the industrial manager is in the same situation as the \\nﬁnancial manager who can increase or decrease his position in a security given predeter-\\nmined conditions.

You discovered what discounting was about in Chapter \\n16 and learnt all about the right discount rate to use in Chapters 19 and 29. Finally, the \\ncomparable method was explained in Chapter 22. This chapter contains an in-depth look \\nat the different valuation techniques and presents the problems (and solutions!) you will \\nprobably encounter when using them. Nevertheless, we want to stress that valuation is not \\na simple use of mathematical formula, it requires the valuator to have good accounting \\nand tax skills. You will also need to fully understand the business model of the firm to \\nbe valued in order to assess the reliability of the business plan supporting the valuation. \\nReading this chapter will only be a first step towards becoming a good valuator and, in \\naddition, a great deal of practice and application will be needed.\\nSection 31.1\\nOVERVIEW  OF THE  DIFFERENT  METHODS\\nGenerally, we want to value a company in order to determine the value of its shares or of \\nits equity capital.\\nBroadly speaking, there are two methods used to value equity: the direct method and \\nthe indirect method. In the direct method, obviously, we value equity directly. In the indi-\\nrect method, we first value the firm as a whole (what we call “enterprise” or “firm” value), \\nthen subtract the value of net debt to get the equity value.\\nIndirect and direct methods\\nEVIndirect methods\\n(EBIT multiple, DCF ...)\\nDirect methods\\n(P/E, DDM. . .)\\nVD\\n‒=\\nVE'),\n",

However, this is more a combination of the techniques used in the direct \\nand indirect methods rather than a method in its own right.\\nLastly, we mention options theory, whose applications we will see in Chapter 34. In \\npractice, nearly no one values equity capital by analogy to a call option on the assets of \\nthe company. The concept of real options, however, had its practical heyday in 1999 and \\n2000 to explain the market values of “new economy” stocks. Needless to say, this method \\nhas since fallen out of favour.\\nIf you remember the efficient market hypothesis, you are probably asking yourself \\nwhy market value and discounted present value would ever differ. In this chapter we will \\ntake a look at the origin of the difference, and try to understand the reason for it and how \\nlong we think it will last. Ultimately, market values and discounted present values should \\nconverge.\\nSection 31.2\\nVALUATION BY DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW\\nThe discounted cash flow method  (DCF) consists of applying the investment decision \\ntechniques (see Chapter 16) to the firm value calculation. We will focus on the present \\nvalue of the cash flows from the investment. This is the fundamental valuation method.\\nIts aim is to value the company as a whole (i.e. to determine the value of the capital \\nemployed, what we call enterprise value). After deducting the value of net debt, the \\nremainder is the value of the company’s shareholders’ equity.'),\n",

This period \\nis called the explicit forecast period. The length of this period varies depending on the \\nsector.

For the years \\nbeyond the explicit forecast period, we establish a terminal value.\\nThe value of the ﬁrm is the sum of the present value of after-tax cash ﬂows over the \\nexplicit forecast period and the terminal value at the end of the explicit forecast \\nperiod.\\n1/ SCHEDULE  OF  FREE  CASH  FLOWS  \\nFree cash flows measure the cash-producing capacity of the company.

The answer will influence your valuation. The \\nobjective of negotiation is to reconcile the buyer’s and seller’s points of view. We have \\nfound in our experience that discounted cash flow analysis is a very useful discussion tool: \\nthe seller gets accustomed to the idea of selling his company and the buyer gets a better \\nunderstanding of the company for sale.\\nIt is all right for a business plan to be optimistic – our bet is that you have never seen a \\npessimistic one – the important thing is how it stands up to scrutiny.

This period is \\nnecessarily limited. In 10 years’ time, for example, probably only a small portion of the \\ncompany’s profits will be derived from the production facilities it currently owns or from \\nits current product portfolio. The company will have become a heterogeneous mix of the \\nassets it has today and those it will have acquired over the next 10 years.\\nThe forecast period should therefore correspond to the time during which the com-\\npany will live off its current configuration. If it is too short, the terminal value will be too \\nlarge and the valuation problem will only be shifted in time. Unfortunately, this happens \\nall too often.

Often \\nanalysts assume that the company enters a phase of maturity after the end of the explicit \\nforecast period. In this case, the terminal value can be based either on the capital \\nemployed or on the free cash flow in the last year of the explicit forecast period.\\nThe most commonly used terminal value formula is the Gordon–Shapiro formula. It \\nconsists of a normalised cash flow, or annuity, that grows at a rate (g) out to perpetuity:\\nValue of the company at the end of the explicit forecast period\\n= −\\nNormalised free cash flow\\nkg\\nHowever, the key challenge is in choosing the normalised free cash flow value and \\nthe perpetual growth rate. The normalised free cash flow must be consistent with the \\nassumptions of the business plan. It depends on long-term growth, the company’s invest-\\nment strategy and the growth in the company’s working capital. Lastly, normalised free \\ncash flows may be different from the free cash flow in the last year of the explicit forecast \\nperiod, because normalised cash flow is what the company will generate after the end of \\nthe explicit forecast period and will continue to generate to perpetuity.\\nConcerning the growth rate to perpetuity, do not get carried away:\\n t Apart from the normalised cash flow’s growth rate to perpetuity, you must take a \\ncold, hard look at your projected long-term growth in return on capital employed. \\nHow long can the economic profit it represents be sustained? How long will market \\ngrowth last?\\n t Most importantly, the company’s rate of growth to perpetuity cannot be significantly \\ngreater than the long-term growth rate of the economy as a whole. For example, if \\nthe anticipated long-term inflation rate is 2% and real GDP growth is expected to be \\n2%, then if you choose a growth rate g that is greater than 4%, you are implying that \\nthe company will not only outperform all of its rivals but also will eventually take \\ncontrol of the economy of the entire country or indeed of the entire world (trees do \\nnot grow to the sky)!4\\nIn the case of Indesit, the normalised cash flow must be calculated for the year 2019, \\nbecause we are looking for the present value at the end of 2018 of the cash flows expected \\nin 2018 and every subsequent year to perpetuity. Given the necessity to invest if growth is \\nto be maintained, you could use the following assumptions to determine the normalised \\ncash flow:\\n4 All the more \\nso as in mature \\nsectors inflation \\nis lower than in \\nthe economy in \\ngeneral.'),\n",

The enterprise \\nvalue of Indesit is therefore €1294m + €359m or €1653m. Note that the terminal value \\nof €1964m at end-2018 corresponds to a multiple of 8.3 times 2018 EBIT. This means \\nthat choosing a multiple of 8.3 is theoretically equivalent to applying a growth rate to \\nperpetuity of 1.5% to the normalised cash flow and discounting it at the required rate of \\nreturn of 8.7%.\\nGiven a net debt of €426m, the equity value of Indesit works out, with this method, \\nat €1227m.\\nSometimes the terminal value is estimated based on a multiple of a measure of oper-\\nating performance. This measure can be, among other things, turnover, EBITDA or EBIT. \\nGenerally, this “horizon multiple” is lower than an equivalent, currently observable, mul-\\ntiple. This is because it assumes that, all other things being equal, prospects for growth \\ndecrease with time, commanding a lower multiple. Nevertheless, since using this method \\nto assess the terminal value implies mixing intrinsic values with comparative values, we \\nstrongly advise against it.\\nComputing the terminal value with a multiple prevents you from pondering over the \\nlevel of ROCE that the company can maintain in the future.\\nRemember that if you compute a terminal value greater than book value, you are \\nimplying that the company will be able to maintain forever a return on capital employed \\nin excess of its weighted average cost of capital. If you choose a lower value, you are \\nimplying that the company will enter a phase of decline after the explicit forecast period \\nand that you think it will not be able to earn its cost of capital in the future. Lastly, if you \\nassume that terminal value is equal to book value, you are implying that the company’s \\neconomic profit5 falls immediately to zero. This is the method of choice in the mining \\nindustry, for example, where we estimate a liquidation value by summing the scrap value \\nof the various assets – land, buildings, equipment – less the costs of restoring the site.\\nIn the case of Indesit, the capital employed end-2018 is €1132m, discounted \\nover five years at 8.7% results in €746m. With this method, the enterprise value as at \\nend-2013 becomes 746 + 359 = €1105m. That this value is below that computed previ-\\nously (€1964m) reflects the fact that the business plan assumes that in 2018 Indesit would \\nyield a ROCE (12.6%) higher than its W ACC.\\nOur experience tells us that no economic profit can be sustained forever. The com-\\npany’s expected return on capital employed must gradually converge towards its cost of \\ncapital. This is the case with Coca-Cola, Michelin or British Airways. Regardless of the \\ncalculation method, the terminal value must reflect this. To model this phenomenon, we \\nrecommend using a “cash flow fade” methodology. In this approach, you define a time \\n5 NOPAT \\n(EBIT after tax) – \\nWACC × Capital \\nemployed.\\nNormalised cash ﬂow\\nNormalised 2019 EBIT 244\\n−Corporate income tax at 40% 98\\n+ Depreciation and amortisation 112\\n− Capital expenditure 112\\n− Change in working capital 5\\n= Normalised 2019 free cash ﬂow 141'),\n",

They might also think that the company will be in a position to earn 1% or 2% more than its cost of capital due to the strength of its strategic position in its markets. Economic theory would not approve that!\\nThis model can also be used for value-destroying companies. Sooner or later, there \\nwill be restructurings and bankruptcies triggering improvements in ROCE, but before \\napplying the cash flow fade method the other way around, our readers would be well \\nadvised to ask themselves whether or not their company will be among the survivors!\\n2/ CHOOSING  A DISCOUNT  RATE\\nAs we value cash flow to the firm, the discount rate is the weighted average cost of \\n capital (W ACC) or simply, the cost of capital. Calculating an accurate cost of capital \\nis one of the key drivers of any valuation exercise based on the discounted cash flow \\napproach. Certain industrial companies use normative discount rates; beware of such rates \\nthat do not yield market values. The weighted average cost of capital is the minimum \\nrate of return required by the company’s fund providers, i.e. shareholders and lenders to \\nfinance the company.\\nThe difficulty is in estimating the weighted average cost of capital in real-world con-\\nditions. You may want to turn back to Chapter 29 for a more detailed look at this topic.'),\n",

Net debt is composed of financial debt net of cash, \\ni.e. of all bank borrowings, bonds, debentures and other financial instruments6 (short-,\\nmedium- or long-term), net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\\nTheoretically, the value of net debt is equal to the value of the future cash outflows \\n(interest and principal payments) it represents, discounted at the market cost of similar \\nborrowings. When all or part of the debt is listed or traded over the counter (listed bonds, \\nsyndicated loans), you can use the market value of the debt. You then subtract the market \\nvalue of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. \\nThe book value of net debt is often used as a first approximation of its present value. \\nNevertheless, in some cases, the value of debt can differ materially from its book value: \\ntWhen the firm has borrowed at fixed rates (directly after having swapped floating-rate \\ndebt) and rates have evolved since then;\\nt When the company’s solvency situation has significantly changed (for the better or \\nthe worse) since it has contracted debt and there has been no spread adjustment to \\nrecognise this change;\\nt When the interest rate has been artificially reduced thanks to the issue of debt with \\nwarrants, or other products (note that this would nevertheless be restated in IFRS or \\nUS GAAP accounts)\\nHence, we strongly advise retaining the market value of debt rather than its book \\nvalue when the net debt is high and the difference between book and market value is \\nmaterial.\\nFor example, as at 31 March 2012, the book value of the Yell Group’s (now renamed \\nHibu) financial debt was £2749m, its fair value was only £2098m, a difference of £651m!  \\nWhen the company’s business is seasonal, year-end working capital may not reflect \\naverage requirements, and debt on the balance sheet at the end of the year may not rep-\\nresent real funding needs over the course of the year (see Chapter 11). Some companies \\nalso perform year-end “window-dressing” in order to show a very low level of net debt. \\nIn these cases, if you notice that interest expense does not correspond to debt balances,7\\nyou should restate the amount of debt by using a monthly average of outstanding net debt, \\nfor example.\\nSome other items may add complexity in the assessment of the real level of debt. \\nFor example, if assets have been removed from the balance sheet thanks to factoring or \\nsecuritization, they need to be added back in. In other cases, sellers may try to “dress” the \\nbalance sheet to show a very low level of debt.\\n4/ OTHER VALUATION ELEMENTS\\n(a) Provisions\\nProvisions must only be included if cash flows exclude them. If the business plan’s EBIT \\ndoes not reflect future charges for which provisions have been set aside – such as for \\nrestructuring, site closures, etc. – then the present value of the corresponding provisions \\non the balance sheet must be deducted from the value of the company.\\n6 Including the \\nvalue of hedging \\ninstruments, if \\nany.\\n7The interest \\nrate calculated \\nas interest in the \\nincome state-\\nment/net debt \\nin the closing \\nbalance sheet \\ndoes not reflect \\nthe actual inter-\\nest rates paid on \\nthe ongoing debt \\nduring the year.'),\n",

How \\nto handle them depends on how they were booked and, potentially, on the age pyramid of \\nthe company’s workforce. You will have to examine the business plan to see whether it \\ntakes future pension payments into account and whether or not a large group of employ-\\nees is to retire just after the end of the explicit forecast period. \\nNormally, pension liabilities should be treated as debt. The present value of future out-\\nﬂows for pensions, net of pension assets, should be subtracted from the enterprise value.\\nWith rare exceptions, deferred tax liabilities generally remain relatively stable. In \\npractice, they are rarely paid out. Consequently, they are usually not considered debt \\nequivalents.\\n(b)Unconsolidated or equity-accounted investments\\nIf unconsolidated or equity-accounted financial investments are not reflected in the \\nprojected cash flows (via dividends received), you should add their value to the value \\nof discounted cash flows. In this case, use the market value of these assets including, if \\nrelevant, tax on capital gains and losses.\\nFor listed securities, use listed market value. Conversely, for minor, unlisted hold-\\nings, the book value is often used as a shortcut. However, if the company holds a signifi-\\ncant stake in the associated company – this is sometimes the case for holdings booked \\nusing the equity method – you will have to value the affiliate separately. This may be a \\nsimple exercise, applying, for example, a sector-average P/E to the company’s pro rata \\nshare of the net income of the affiliate. It can also be more detailed, by valuing the affiliate \\nwith a multi-criteria approach if the information is available.\\n(c) Tax-loss carryforwards\\nIf tax-loss carryforwards are not yet included in the business plan,8 you will have to value \\nany tax-loss carryforward separately, discounting tax savings until deficits are exhausted. \\nWe advise discounting savings at the cost of equity capital as they are directly linked to \\nthe earnings of the company and are as volatile (if not more so).\\n(d)Minority interests\\nFuture free cash flows calculated on the basis of consolidated financial information will \\nbelong partly to the shareholders of the parent company and partly to minority sharehold-\\ners in subsidiary companies, if any.\\nIf minority interests are significant, you will have to deduct them from the enterprise \\nvalue. If material they should be valued separately and this can be done by performing a \\nseparate valuation of the subsidiaries in which some minority shareholders hold a stake.  \\nNaturally, this assumes you have access to detailed information about the subsidiaries.\\nYou can also use a multiple approach. Simplifying to the extreme, you could apply \\nthe group’s implied P/E multiple to the minority shareholders’ portion of net profit to get \\na first-blush estimate of the value of minority interests. Alternatively, you could apply the \\ngroup’s price-to-book ratio to the minority interests appearing on the balance sheet. \\nIn either case, we would not recommend using book value to value minority interests \\nunless amounts are low.\\n8 Through a \\ntemporary lower \\ncorporate income \\ntax.'),\n",

If these instruments have a \\nmarket value, your best bet will be to subtract that value from the enterprise value of the \\ncompany to derive the value of equity capital, just as you would for net debt. The number \\nof shares to use in determining the value per share will then be the number of shares cur-\\nrently in circulation.\\nAlternatively, you could adjust the number of shares used to calculate value per share. \\nThis is the treasury stock method (see page 401). Its drawback lies in ignoring the value \\nof out-of-the money dilutive instruments.\\n5/ PROS AND CONS OF THE CASH FLOW APPROACH\\nThe advantage of the discounted cash flow approach is that it quantifies the often implicit \\nassumptions and projections of buyers and sellers. It also makes it easier to keep your \\nfeet closer to the ground during periods of market euphoria, excessively high valuations \\nand astronomical multiples. It forces the valuation to be based on the company’s real \\neconomic performance.\\nYou might be tempted to think this method works only to estimate the value of the \\nmajority shareholder’s stake and not for estimating the discounted value of a flow of divi-\\ndends. You might even be tempted to go a step further and apply a minority discount to\\nthe present value of future cash flows for valuing a minority holding.\\nThis is wrong. Applying a minority discount to the discounted cash flow method \\nimplies that you think the majority shareholder is not managing the company fairly .\\nA discount is justified only if there are “losses in transmission” between free cash flow \\nand dividends. This can be the case if the company’s strategy regarding dividends, bor-\\nrowing and new investment is unsatisfactory or oriented towards increasing the value of \\nsome other assets owned by the majority shareholder.\\nMinority discounts are inconsistent with the discounted cash flow method. Similarly, \\nincreasing the cash-flow based value can be justified only if the investor believes he can \\nunlock synergies that will increase free cash flows.\\nNevertheless, as satisfying as this method is in theory, it presents three major \\ndrawbacks:\\n1. It is very sensitive to assumptions and, consequently, the results it generates are \\nvery volatile. It is a rational method, but the difficulty in predicting the future \\nbrings significant uncertainty.\\n2. It sometimes depends too much on the terminal value, in which case the problem \\nis only shifted to a later period. Often the terminal value accounts for more than \\n50% of the value of the company, compromising the method’s validity. However, \\nit is sometimes the only applicable method, such as in the case of a loss-making \\ncompany for which multiples are inapplicable;\\n3. Lastly, it is not always easy to produce a business plan over a sufficiently long \\nperiod of time. External analysts often find they lack critical information.'),\n",

The critical \\nvariable is the rate of growth in dividends. It is quite an arbitrary figure as, in the compu-\\ntation, this rate is not a function of any of the factors that give rise to it: marginal rate of \\nreturn, payout ratio, gearing, etc.\\nThis method is still used in very specific cases – for example, for companies in mature \\nsectors with very good visibility and high payout ratios, such as utilities, concessions and \\nreal estate companies.\\nUsing the same logic, one can compute the value of equity by discounting free cash \\nflow to equity (and no longer to firm) at the cost of equity. Free cash flow to equity is \\nmoney available for shareholders, i.e. free cash flow to the firm minus after-tax interest \\npayments and plus changes in net debt.\\nThis method is not an easy one to carry out if there is regular change in the financial \\nstructure which prompts regular change in the cost of equity. But it is widely used to \\nvalue banks, whose financial structures do not change much over time due to regulatory \\nconstraints.10\\nSection 31.3\\nMULTIPLE APPROACH OR PEER -GROUP\\nCOMPARISONS\\n1/ PRESENTATION\\nThe peer comparison or multiples approach (or comparables, “comps” method) is based \\non three fundamental principles:\\ntthe company is to be valued in its entirety;\\nt the company is valued at a multiple of its profit-generating capacity. The most com-\\nmonly used are the P/E ratio, EBITDA and EBIT multiples;\\nt markets are efficient and comparisons are therefore justified.\\nThe approach is global , because it is based not on the value of operating assets and \\nliabilities per se, but on the overall returns they are expected to generate. The value of \\nthe company is derived by applying a certain multiplier to the company’s profitability \\nparameters. As we saw in Chapter 22, multiples depend on expected growth, risk and \\ninterest rates.\\nHigh expected growth, low risk in the company’s sector and low interest rates will all \\npush multiples higher.\\n9 That is, before \\n1995 in Europe \\nand the USA.\\n10Basel III.'),\n",

At a given point in time and in a given country, compa-\\nnies are bought and sold at a specific price level, represented, for example, by an EBIT \\nmultiple. These prices are based on internal parameters and by the overall stock market \\ncontext. Prices paid for companies acquired in Europe in 2010, for example, when EBIT \\nmultiples were relatively low (7/8 times on average) were not the same as for those \\nacquired in 1980 when multiples hovered around four times EBIT, nor for those bought in \\n2000, when multiples were very high (c.12 to 15 times).\\nMultiples can derive from a sample of comparable, listed companies or a sample of \\ncompanies that have recently been sold. The latter sample has the virtue of representing \\nactual transaction prices for the equity value of a company. These multiples are respec-\\ntively called market multiples or trading multiples and transaction multiples, and we \\nwill look at them in turn. As these multiples result from comparing a market value with \\naccounting figures, keep in mind that the two must be consistent. The enterprise value \\nmust be compared with operating data, such as turnover, EBITDA or EBIT. The value of \\nequity capital must be compared with a figure after interest expense, such as net profit or \\ncash flow.\\n2/ BUILDING A SAMPLE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES\\nFor market multiples, a peer group comparison consists of setting up a sample of \\ncomparable listed companies that have not only similar sector characteristics, but also \\nsimilar operating characteristics, such as ROCE and expected growth rates. Given \\nthat the multiple is usually calculated on short-term projections, you should choose \\ncompanies whose shares are liquid and are covered by a sufficient number of financial \\nanalysts.\\n3/ THE MENU OF MULTIPLES\\nThere are two major groups of multiples: those based on the enterprise value (i.e. the \\nvalue of capital employed) and those based on the value of equity.\\nMultiples based on the value of capital employed are multiples of operating balances \\nbefore subtracting interest expense. We believe NOPAT is the best denominator, i.e. EBIT \\nless corporate income taxes on EBIT. But many practitioners use EBIT, which is not a \\nmajor problem provided corporate income tax rates are roughly the same for all the com-\\npanies in the sample. The EBITDA multiple is also widely used.\\nMultiples based on the value of equity are multiples of operating balances after \\ninterest expense, principally net income (P/E multiple), as well as multiples of cash flow \\nand multiples of underlying income – i.e. before non-recurring items.\\n(a)Multiples based on enterprise value\\nWhatever multiple you choose, you will have to value the capital employed for each listed \\ncompany in the sample. This value is the sum of the company’s market capitalisation (or \\ntransaction value of equity for transaction multiples) and the value of its net debt at the \\nvaluation date and other adjustments presented.'),\n",

If pension \\nassets minus pension liabilities have been added to enterprise value, then the part of pension \\ncost corresponding to the interest cost shall not be included in the EBIT or EBITDA11, etc.\\nYou will then calculate the multiple for the comparable companies over three fiscal \\nyears: the current year, last year and next year. Note that we use the same value of capital \\nemployed in all three cases, as current market values should reflect anticipated changes in \\nfuture operating results.12\\nEBIT multiple\\nThe EBIT multiple is the ratio of the value of capital employed to EBIT (operating \\nincome). It enables us to compare the genuine profit-generating capacity of the sample \\ncompanies.\\nA company’s genuine proﬁt-generating capacity is the normalised operating proﬁtability \\nit can generate year after year, excluding exceptional gains and losses and other non-\\nrecurring items.\\nYou may have to perform a series of restatements in order to derive this operating income \\n(see Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion).\\nConsider the following sample of listed companies comparable to Indesit, the char-\\nacteristics of which in 2014 were as follows:\\n11 Which could \\nbe the case under \\nIFRS.\\n12For more \\non this, see the \\nVernimmen.com \\nNewsletter no. \\n24, May 2007.\\n€m Electrolux Whirlpool SEB De Longhi\\nMarket capitalisation (value of equity) 56.193 11.311 2.922 2.243\\n+ Value of debt 13.664 1.193 412 81\\n= Value of capital employed (A) 69.857 12.504 3.334 2.324\\n2014e Operating income (EBIT) (B) 4.990 1.575 356 208\\n2014e EBIT multiple (A/B) 11.3 7.9 9.4 11.2\\nThe 2014 average pre-tax operating income (EBIT) multiple is 9.9 times.

It has the merit of \\neliminating the sometimes significant differences in depreciation methods and periods. \\nIt is very frequently used by stock market analysts for companies in capital-intensive \\nindustries.\\nBe careful when using the EBITDA multiple, however, especially when the sample \\nand the company to be valued have widely disparate levels of margins. In these cases, the \\nEBITDA multiple tends to overvalue companies with low margins and undervalue com-\\npanies with high margins, independently of depreciation policy. Let’s take the following \\nexample:'),\n",

If we use this same multiple to value Group B, \\nwe derive an enterprise value for Group B of 30 (10 × 3). But if the cost structure of Group \\nB remains the same in the future, its EBIT will never be positive; if that is the case, why \\nshould an investor pay a single cent for such a company? The value of such a firm should \\nbe nil. This is the result we find if we prefer the EBIT multiple to the EBITDA multiple.\\nOther multiples\\nOperating multiples can also be calculated on the basis of other measures, such as \\nturnover. Some industries have even more specific multiples, such as multiples of the \\nnumber of subscribers, number of visitors or page views for Internet companies, tonnes \\nof cement produced, etc. These multiples are particularly interesting when the return on \\ncapital employed of the companies in the sample is standard. Otherwise, results will be \\ntoo widely dispersed. They are only meaningful for small businesses such as shops where \\nthere are a lot of transactions and where, in many countries, turnover gives a better view \\nof the profitability than the official profit figure.\\nThese multiples are generally used to value companies that are not yet profitable: \\nthey were widely used during the Internet bubble, for instance. They tend to ascribe far \\ntoo much value to the company to be valued and we recommend that you avoid them.\\n(b)Multiples based on equity value\\nYou may also decide to choose multiples based on operating balances after interest \\nexpense. These multiples include the P/E ratio, the cash flow multiple and the price-to-\\nbook ratio. All these multiples use market capitalisation at the valuation date (or price \\npaid for the equity for transaction multiples) as their numerator. The denominators are net \\nprofit, cash flow and book equity, respectively. The net profit used by analysts is the com-\\npany’s bottom line, i.e. the net profit attributable to the group (after deduction of minority \\ninterests) restated to exclude non-recurring items and the depreciation of goodwill, so as \\nto put the emphasis on recurrent profit-generating capacity.\\nUsing the same sample of comparable comparisons for Indesit presented before, we \\nnotice that, in mid-2014, their average 2014e P/E ratio is 15.9:\\nGroup A Group B\\nSales 100 100\\nEBITDA 20 10\\nDepreciation 10 10\\nEBIT 10 0\\nEnterprise value 60 ?\\nLocal currency Electrolux Whirlpool SEB De Longhi\\nMarket capitalisation (A) 56,193 11,311 2,922 2,243\\n2014 Net income (B) 2821 981 201 128\\nP/E ratio (A) / (B) 19.9 11.5 14.5 17.5'),\n",

As the two companies are comparable, we might be \\ntempted to apply Ann’s P/E ratio to Valeria’s bottom line to obtain Valeria’s market capi-\\ntalisation – i.e. the market value of its shares, or 25 × 34 = 850.\\nCompany Ann Valeria\\nOperating income 150 177\\n− Interest expense 30 120\\n− Corporate income tax (40%) 48 23\\n= Net proﬁt 72 34\\nMarket capitalization 1800   ?\\nValue of debt (at 10% p.a.) 300 1200\\nAlthough it looks logical, this reasoning is flawed. Applying a P/E ratio of 25 to \\nValeria’s net income is tantamount to applying a P/E of 25 to Valeria’s NOPAT (177 ×\\n(1 – 40%) = 106) less a P/E of 25 applied to its after-tax interest expense (120 × (1 – \\n40%) = 72). After all, net income is equal to net operating profit after tax less interest \\nexpense after tax.\\nThe first term (25 × NOPAT) should represent the enterprise value of Valeria, i.e. \\n25 × 106 = 2650.\\nThe second term (25 × after-tax interest expense) should represent the value of debt to \\nbe subtracted from enterprise value to give the value of equity capital that we are seeking. \\nHowever, 25 × interest expense after tax is 1800, whereas the value of the debt is only 1200.\\nIn this case, this type of reasoning would result in overstating the value of the debt (at \\n1800 instead of 1200) and then understating the value of the company’s equity.\\nThe proper reasoning is as follows: we first use the multiple of Ann’s NOPAT to get \\nValeria’s enterprise value. If Ann’s market capitalisation is 1800 and its debt is worth 300, \\nthen its enterprise value is 1800 + 300, or 2100. As Ann’s NOPAT is 150 × (1 – 40%) =\\n90, the multiple of Ann’s NOPAT is 2100/90 = 23.3. Valeria’s enterprise value is therefore \\nequal to 23.3 times its NOPAT, or 23.3 × 106 = 2470. We now subtract the value of the \\ndebt (1200) to obtain the value of equity capital, or 1270. This is not the same as 850!\\nThese distortions are the reason why financial analysts use multiples of operating \\nincome (EBIT) or of operating income before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). \\nThis approach removes the bias introduced by different financial structures.\\n4/ TRANSACTION MULTIPLES\\nThe approach is slightly different, but the method of calculation is the same. The sample \\nis composed of information available on recent transactions in the same sector, such as the \\nsale of a controlling block of shares, a merger, etc.'),\n",

As such, the price \\nincludes the value of anticipated synergies. Using the listed share prices leads to a so-called \\nminority value, which we now know is nothing other than the standalone value. In contrast, \\ntransaction multiples reflect majority value – i.e. the value including any control premium for \\nsynergies. For listed companies it has been empirically observed that control premiums are \\naround 25% of pre-bid market prices (i.e. prices prior to the announcement of the tender offer).\\nYou will find that it is often difficult to apply this method, because good informa-\\ntion on truly comparable transactions is often lacking or incomplete (price paid not made \\n public, unknown aggregates when the company is private, etc.).\\n5/ MEDIANS , MEANS  AND  REGRESSIONS\\nPeople often ask if they should value a company by multiplying its profit-generating \\ncapacity by the mean or the median of the multiples of the sample of comparable com-\\npanies. Our advice is to be wary of both means and medians, as they can mask wide \\n disparities within the sample, and sometimes may contain extreme situations that should \\nbe excluded altogether. Try to understand why the differences exist in the first place rather \\nthan to bury them in a mean or median value that has little real significance. For exam-\\nple, look at the multiples of the companies in the sample as a function of their expected \\ngrowth. Sometimes this can be a very useful tool in positioning the company to be valued \\nin the context of the sample.\\nSome analysts perform linear regressions to find a relationship between, for example, \\nthe EBIT multiple and expected growth in EBIT, the multiple of turnover and the operat-\\ning margin, and the price-to-book ratio and the return on equity (to value banks).\\nThis method allows us to position the company to be valued within the sample. The \\nissue remaining, then, is to find the most relevant criterion. R2 indicates the significance \\nof the regression line, and will be our guide in determining which criteria are the most \\nrelevant in the industry in question. Sometimes it allows you to choose a multiple outside \\nthe range of comparables’ multiples simply because the company you are valuing has \\nhigher or lower expected growth than others you are comparing it with.\\n7.8x\\n9.1x\\n8.4x\\n6.2x\\n6.6x\\n7.7x\\n6.3x\\n6.6\\n7.5x\\n0 \\n50 \\n100 \\n150 \\n200 \\n250 \\n300 \\n350 \\n400 \\n450 \\n500 \\n5.0x\\n5.5x\\n6.0x\\n6.5x\\n7.0x\\n7.5x\\n8.0x\\n8.5x\\n9.0x\\n9.5x\\n10.0x\\nDec-04 Dec-05 Dec-06 Dec-07 Dec-08 Dec-09 Dec-10 Dec-11 Dec-12 Dec-13\\nEntreprise value/EBITDA STOXX® Europe Mid 200\\nEntreprise value/EBITDA ratios for change of control of companies worth\\nbetween €15m and €150m and stock market index for mid-cap listed companies\\nSource: Argos Soditic and STOXX '),\n",

It is a method well suited \\nfor diversiﬁed groups or conglomerates for which consolidated accounts projections give \\ntoo global a view.\\nThe sum-of-the-parts method is simple. It consists in systematically studying the value \\nof each asset and each liability on the company’s balance sheet. For a variety of reasons \\n– accounting, tax, historical – book values are often far from reality. They must therefore \\nbe restated and revalued before they can be assumed to reflect a true net asset value. The \\nsum-of-the-parts method is an additive method. Revalued assets are summed, and the \\ntotal of revalued liabilities is subtracted.\\nFor diversified groups, the SOTP or NA V method implies valuing subsidiaries or \\nactivities pro rata the ownership level using either the DCF or the multiples of comparable \\ncompanies method. Then, debt of the mother company13 is deducted as well as the present \\nvalue of central costs.\\nFor example, Exane BNP Paribas issued the following valuation in early 2014 for the \\nFrench construction and concession group Vinci:\\n13 Not that of \\nsubsidiaries, as \\nit has already \\nbeen taken into \\naccount when \\nvaluing the \\nsubsidiaries.\\nValue Valuation method\\nVinci construction 5,557 Listed peers, M&A, DCF\\nVinci Eurovia (roads) 2,386 Listed peers\\nVinci Energies 4,126 Listed peers, M&A\\nVinci Real Estate 494 Listed peers\\nASF/Escota (concession) 21,133 DCF, DDM\\nCoﬁroute (concession) 8,182 DCF, DDM\\nA19 749 DCF, DDM\\nAirports 5,164 Listed peers, DDM\\nOther consolidated concessions 197 BV multiple, M&A\\nEquity consolidated concessions 243 BV multiple\\nHolding−341\\nTotal enterprise value 47,890\\nAdjusted net debt−10,760\\nMinorities −261\\nEquity value 36,869'),\n",

This value might \\nseem indisputable from a theoretical point of view, but it virtually assumes that the \\nbuyer’s goal is liquidation. This is rarely the case. Acquisitions are usually motivated \\nby the promise of industrial or commercial synergies;\\nt value in use: this is the value of an asset that is used in the company’s operations. It \\nis a kind of market value at replacement cost;\\nt liquidation value: this is the value of an asset during a fire sale to get cash as soon as \\npossible to avoid bankruptcy. It is market value minus a discount.\\nThe sum-of-the-parts method is the easiest to use and the values it generates are the least \\nquestionable when the assets have a value on a market that is independent of the com-\\npany’s operations, such as the property market, the market for aeroplanes, etc. It is hard \\nto put a figure on a new factory in a new industrial estate. The value of the inventories and \\nvineyards of a wine company is easy to determine and relatively undisputed.\\nA wide variety of values is available when we apply the sum-of-the-parts method. \\nPossible approaches are numerous. We can assume discontinuation of the business – either \\nsudden or gradual – or that it will continue as a going concern, for example. The important \\nthing is to be consistent and stick to the same approach throughout the valuation process.\\n1/ TANGIBLE ASSETS\\nProduction assets can be evaluated on the basis of replacement value, liquidation value, \\ngoing-concern value or yet other values.\\nWe do not intend to go into great detail here. Our main point is that in the sum-of-the-\\nparts method it is important to determine an overall value for productive and commercial \\nassets. Rather than trying to decompose assets into small units, you should reason on a \\ngeneral basis and consider sufficiently large groups of assets that have a standalone value \\n(i.e. for which a market exists or that can operate on a standalone basis).\\nFor example, it makes no sense to value the land on which a warehouse has been built. It \\nmakes more sense to value the combination of the land and the buildings on it. An appraiser will \\nvalue the combination based on its potential productive capacity, not on the basis of its individ-\\nual components. Of course, this is not the case if the objective is to reuse the land for something \\nelse, in which case you will want to deduct the cost of knocking down the warehouse.\\n2/ INVENTORIES\\nFor industrial companies, valuing inventories usually does not pose a major problem, \\nunless they contain products that are obsolete or in poor condition. In this case, we have \\nto apply a discount to their book value, based on a routine inventory of the products.\\nIn some situations, you will have to revalue the inventories of companies with long \\nproduction cycles; the revaluation can lead to gains on inventories. This is often the case '),\n",

Here again, revaluation will \\nhave an impact on income taxes. Remember that when you revalue inventories, you are \\ndecreasing future profits.\\n3/ INTANGIBLE ASSETS\\nIt might seem paradoxical to value intangible assets, since their liquidation value has, for \\na long time, been considered to be low. It is now widely acknowledged, however, that the \\nvalue of a company is partly determined by the real value of its intangible assets, be they \\nbrand names, a geographical location or other advantages.\\nThe sum-of-the-parts approach makes no sense unless it takes into account the \\ncompany’s intangible assets.\\nSome noteworthy examples:\\ntlease rights: the present value of the difference between market rental rates and the \\nrent paid by the company;\\nt brands: particularly hard to value but the importance of brands in valuation is     \\ngrowing.\\nIn general, there are three methods for valuing brands:\\nMethod 1The first method asks how much would have to be spent in advertising \\nexpense, after tax, to rebuild the brand. This method leads to undervaluation of new and \\nsuccessful brands and overvaluation of older and failing brands.\\nMethod 2The second method calculates the present value of all royalty payments that \\nwill or could be received from the use of the brand by a third party. It is very sensitive to \\nthe chosen royalty rate.\\nMethod 3The third method consists in analysing the brand’s fundamental utility. After \\nall, the brand’s raison d’être is to enable the company to sell more and at higher prices \\nthan would otherwise be possible without the brand name. Discounting this “excess \\nprofit” over a certain period of time should, after subtracting the related higher costs, \\nyield an estimate of the value of the brand. Users of this method discount the incremental \\nfuture operating income expected from the use of the brand and subtract the additional \\noperating expense, working capital and investments, thereby isolating the value of the \\nbrand. We will not hide the fact that this approach, while intellectually appealing, is very \\ndifficult to apply in practice, because often there is no generic “control” product to use as \\na benchmark.\\ntpatents and technical know-how: they are valued as brands, but with the same \\ndifficulties.\\n4/ TAX IMPLICATIONS\\nThe acquirer’s objectives will influence the way taxes are included (or not) in the sum-of-\\nthe-parts approach.'),\n",

The \\ntaxes (or tax credits) theoretically generated will then decrease (increase) the ultimate \\nvalue of the asset.\\nt If the objective is to acquire some assets (and liabilities), and to run them as a going \\nconcern, then the assets will be revalued through the transaction. Increased deprecia-\\ntion will then lower income tax compared to liquidation or the breakup case above.14\\nt If the objective is to acquire a company and maintain it as a going concern (i.e. not \\ndiscontinue its activities) and as a separate entity, the acquiring company buys the \\nshares of the target company rather than the underlying assets. It cannot revalue the \\nassets on its books and will depreciate them from a lower base than if it had acquired \\nthe assets directly. As a result, depreciation expense will be lower and taxes higher.\\n5/ USEFULNESS OF SUM -OF-THE -PARTS VALUES\\nSum-of-the-parts values can be deceptive as many people think they imply safe or reliable \\nvalues. In fact, when we say that a company has a high net asset value, it means that from \\na free cash flow point of view, the company’s terminal value is high compared with the \\nvalue of intermediate cash flows. Consequently, the more “net asset value” a company has \\nand the fewer cash flows it has, the more speculative and volatile its value is. Granted, its \\nindustrial risk may be lower, but most of the value derives from speculation about resale \\nprices.\\nFor this reason, the sum-of-the-parts method is useful for valuing small companies \\nwith no particular strategic value, or companies whose assets can be sold readily on a \\nsecondary market (aeroplanes, cinemas, etc.).\\nSection 31.5\\nCOMPARISON OF VALUATION METHODS\\n1/ RECONCILING THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUATION\\nIf markets are efficient, all of the valuation methods discussed so far should lead to the \\nsame valuation. In reality, however, there are often differences among the sum-of-the-\\nparts value, the DCF-based value and the peer-comparison value. You must analyse the \\nsource of these differences and resist the temptation to average them!\\n(a) Analysing the difference between sum-of-the-parts value and discounted cash \\nﬂow value\\nIf the sum-of-the-parts value is higher than the DCF value or the value derived from a \\ncomparison of multiples, then the company is being valued more for its past, its revalued \\nequity capital, than for its outlook for future profitability. In this case, the company should \\nnot invest but divest, liquidating its assets to boost profitability and improve the allocation \\nof its resources.\\n14 Acquisition of \\nassets will most \\noften gener-\\nate deductible \\ndepreciation \\nwhereas acquisi-\\ntion of shares \\nof a company \\nwill generate \\ngoodwill, which \\nin most European \\ncountries does \\nnot give rise to \\ntax-deductible\\namortisation.'),\n",

The buyer \\nrealised a gain because the parts were worth more than the company as a whole. Far from \\na return to unbridled, 19th-century capitalism, these purely financial transactions repre-\\nsented a better allocation of resources as well as punishment for bad management.\\nIf the sum-of-the-parts value is lower than the DCF value or the value derived from \\nmultiples, which is the usual case in an economy where companies have a lot of intan-\\ngibles, then the company is very profitable and invests in projects with expected profit-\\nability greater than their cost of capital. The company has real expertise, strong strategic \\npositioning and enjoys high barriers to entry. But the chances are that it will not escape \\ncompetitive pressure forever.\\nGoodwill value has long been used to correct the restated net asset value to take into \\naccount the anticipated return on capital employed of the firm compared to its cost of \\ncapital and hence to value its “intangible capital”.\\nThe starting point of all these mixed methods was to determine the capital employed \\nrestated for potential capital gains or losses. Then a normative operating profit was com-\\nputed by applying the cost of capital to the capital employed. The difference between the \\nactual operating profit and the normative operating profit was called super-profit (leading \\nto goodwill if positive and badwill if negative). The super-profit is to be discounted over \\na certain period to derive the value of goodwill. This is conceptually close to the EV A.\\n(b) Comparison values versus DCF values\\nIf the value obtained via peer comparison is greater than the DCF-based value (and if \\nall the calculations are correct!), then the company’s managers should be thinking about \\nfloating the company on the stock exchange, because financial investors have a more posi-\\ntive view of the company’s risk profile and profitability outlook than its management or \\ncurrent shareholders. Conversely, if the value obtained by comparison is lower than the \\nDCF value and if the business plan is reliable, it would be wiser to wait until more of the \\nlong-term growth potential in the company’s business plan feeds through to its financial \\nstatements before launching an IPO; and perhaps do a public-to-private16 if the company \\nis already listed.\\nIf transaction multiples generate a significantly higher value than market multiples \\nor the DCF model, then it would be better to organise a trade sale by soliciting bids from \\nseveral industry participants. In short, look before you leap!\\n(c) Is there one valuation method for selling a company and another for buying it?\\nThere is no technical reason why a seller should not use one valuation method and the \\nbuyer another:\\ntA seller usually favours the DCF method as it is based upon a business plan which \\nis rarely built on pessimistic assumptions! Most business plans are fathered by the \\nmanagement under instruction from selling shareholders. But in the back of his mind, \\na seller will not forget results obtained with a peer-comparison method as he will be \\nvery reluctant to sell at a lower multiple than the one obtained by a competitor a few \\nmonths ago or the one he could get through an IPO.\\n15 Breakup of \\nABN AMRO, \\nScottish & \\nNewcastle, \\nHagemayer.\\n16See page 842.'),\n",

He will claim that other buyers have paid 100 and there is no rea-\\nson why he should pay 120 or 130. Nevertheless, at the back of his mind the buyer is \\nthinking about his own business plan including synergies and new developments. He \\nwill soon be able to compute his own DCF to check whether the price he will pay is \\nexpected to create value for his own shareholders.\\n2/ THE LIFECYCLE  THEORY  OF  COMPANY  VALUE\\nCompanies that have achieved a certain level of success will see their sum-of-the-parts \\nand cash flow values differ throughout their lifecycle. Lifecycle is an important factor in \\ndetermining the value of companies, as it was in determining the optimal capital structure \\nand financing policies.\\nWhen the company is founded, its net asset value and cash flow value are identical; \\nthe company has not yet made any investments. After the first year or two of operations, \\nnet asset value may dip because of start-up losses. Meanwhile, cash flow value is greater \\nbecause it anticipates hopefully positive future profitability.\\nDuring the growth phase, net asset value will rise as all or part of the company’s \\nprofits are reinvested and the company builds a customer base (the value of which does \\nnot appear in the accounts, however). Cash flow value also continues to rise and remains \\nabove the net asset value. The company’s expertise has not yet become a tangible asset. It \\nis still associated with the people who developed it.\\nAt maturity, cash flow value will start growing more slowly or stop growing alto-\\ngether, reflecting a normal profit trend. Nonetheless, the net asset value continues to grow, \\nbut more slowly because the company increases its payout ratio. Broadly speaking, net \\nasset value and cash flow value are very close.\\nIf the company then enters a phase of decline, its profits decline and the cash \\nflow value slips below net asset value. The latter continues to grow but only very \\nslowly, until the company starts posting losses. The net asset value falls. As for cash \\nflow value, it is already very low. The net asset value then becomes particularly \\nspeculative .\\nValue\\nFounding Launch Growth Maturity Decline Death\\nTime\\nRestated net asset value\\nThe lifecycle of value \\nCash flow value\\nNet asset value and cash ﬂow value evolve differently throughout the life of the company.\\nAt any given point in time, it is very important to understand the reasons for the differ-\\nence between the net asset value and the cash flow value, because this understanding gives \\nimportant clues as to the situation and future prospects of the company.'),\n",

Experience has \\nproven that the higher the stock market, the higher the price of unlisted companies.\\nParticipants in the market for corporate control think the same way as investors in the \\nfinancial market. Of course, the smaller the company is, the more tenuous is the link. \\nThe value of a butcher’s shop or a bakery is largely intangible and hard to measure, and \\nthus has little in common with financial market values. But in reality, only appearances \\nmake the market for corporate control seem fundamentally different.\\n1/ STRATEGIC VALUE AND CONTROL PREMIUM\\nThere is no real control value other than strategic value. We will develop this concept \\nlater. For a long time, the control premium was a widely accepted notion that was virtually \\na pardon for dispossessing minority shareholders.

Shareholder \\nagreements are a common method for expressing this principle in unlisted companies.\\nWhen control of a listed company changes hands, minority shareholders receive the same \\npremium as that paid to the majority shareholder.\\nNevertheless, entrepreneurs often have a diametrically opposed view. For them, minority \\nshareholders are passive beneficiaries of the fruits of all the personal energy the manag-\\ners/majority shareholders have invested in the company. It is difficult to convince entre-\\npreneurs that the roles of management and shareholders can be separated and that they \\nmust be compensated differently – and especially that the risk assumed by all types of \\nshareholders must be rewarded.\\nWhat then is the basis for this premium which, in the case of listed companies, can \\noften lift a purchase price to 20% or 30% more than current market price? The premium \\nis still called a “control premium” even though it is now paid to minority shareholders as \\nwell as to the majority shareholder.\\nIf we assume that markets are efficient, the existence of such a premium can be justi-\\nfied only if the new owners of the company obtain more value from it than its previous \\nowners did. A control premium derives from the industrial, commercial, administrative \\nor tax synergies the new majority shareholders hope to unlock. They hope to improve the \\nacquired company’s results by managing it better, pooling resources, combining businesses \\nor taking advantage of economies of scale. These value-creating actions are reflected in the \\nbuyer’s valuation. The trade buyer (i.e. an acquirer who already has industrial operations) \\nwants to acquire the company so as to change the way it is run and, in doing so, create value.\\n0\\n100\\n200\\n300\\n400\\n500\\n600\\n0%\\n5%\\n10%\\n15%\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\nAverage control premium paid (righthand scale, %) Eurostoxx 600 (lefthand scale)\\nAverage control premium paid in Europe and stock market prices\\nSource: Exane BNP Paribas, Datastream'),\n",

This difference can lead to a different valuation of the \\ncompany. We call this strategic value.\\nStrategic value is the maximum value a trade buyer is prepared to pay for a company. \\nIt includes the value of projected free cash flows of the target on a standalone basis, plus \\nthe value of synergies from combining the company’s businesses with those of the trade \\nbuyer. It also includes the value of expected improvement in the company’s profitability \\ncompared to the business plan provided, if any.\\nWe previously demonstrated that the value of a financial security is independent of \\nthe portfolio to which it belongs, but now we are confronted with an exception. Depending \\non whether a company belongs to one group of companies or another, it does not have the \\nsame value. Make sure you understand why this is the case. The difference in value derives \\nfrom different cash flow projections, not from a difference in the discount rate applied to \\nthem, which is a characteristic of the company and identical for all investors. The princi-\\nples of value are the same for everyone, but strategic value is different for each trade \\nbuyer, because each of them places a different value on the synergies it believes it can \\nunlock and on its ability to manage the business better than current management.\\nFor this reason, a company’s strategic value is often higher than its standalone value.\\nAs the seller will also hope to benefit from the synergies, negotiation will focus on how \\nthe additional profitability the synergies are expected to generate will be shared between \\nthe buyer and the seller.\\nBut some industrial groups go overboard, buying companies at twice their standalone \\nvalue on the pretext that their strategic value is high or that establishing a presence in \\nsuch-and-such geographic location is crucial. They are in for a rude awakening. Some-\\ntimes the market has already put a high price tag on the target company. Specifically, \\nwhen the market anticipates merger synergies, speculation can drive the share price far \\nabove the company’s strategic value, even if all synergies are realised. In other cases, a \\nwell-managed company may benefit little or even be hurt by teaming up with another \\ncompany in the same industry, meaning either that there are no synergies to begin with or, \\nworse, that they are negative.\\n2/ MINORITY DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS\\nWe have often seen minority holdings valued with a discount, and you will quickly under-\\nstand why we believe this is unjustified. A “minority discount” would imply that minority \\nshareholders have proportionally less of a claim on the cash flows generated by the com-\\npany than the majority shareholder. This is not true.'),\n",

On average in Europe, \\nthe premium paid to buy out minorities is in the region of 20%, only marginally less than \\nthat paid to obtain control. Indeed, majority shareholders may be willing to pay such \\na premium if they need full control over the acquired company to implement certain \\nsynergies.\\nHaving said that, the lack of liquidity associated with certain minority holdings, \\neither because the company is not listed or because trading volumes are low compared \\nwith the size of the minority stake, can justify a discount. In this case, the discount does \\nnot really derive from the minority stake per se, but from its lack of liquidity.\\nLack of liquidity may increase the volatility of the share price. Therefore investors \\nwill discount an illiquid investment at a higher rate than a liquid one. The difference in \\nvalues results in a liquidity discount.\\nWe have encountered some cases where it exceeded 50% for a minority shareholder \\nthat wanted to sell its shares which the majority shareholder only offered to buy after three \\nyears. But we have also seen the lack of discount when the disposal of a small stake could \\nchange the balance of power in a company. \\nThe minority shareholder may have to wait for the majority shareholder to sell his \\nstake to realise the full value of his investment. This is similar to the situation of a listed \\ncompany with a reduced free float where the minority shareholder is then in the hand of \\nthe majority shareholder who controls the market communication of the firm. Some listed \\nfirms can suffer from an undervaluation due to reduced liquidity of the share, so analysts \\ndo not publish research and it then becomes a vicious circle.\\nIn a listed company of sufficient size with widely spread capital, the situation is dif-\\nferent as the minority shareholder will be protected by the relevant share price and the \\nprotection afforded by market authorities.\\nThe only reliable assessment of liquidity discount is provided by the IPO discount that \\nthe seller may have to suffer in the case of listing of a company. But the urgency of \\nthe disposal and the bargaining power between seller and buyer may alter this level \\nsigniﬁcantly.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nDiscounted cash ﬂow, or DCF, is based on the notion that the value of the company is equal \\nto the amount of free cash ﬂows expected to be generated by the company in the future \\nand discounted at a rate commensurate with its risk proﬁle. The discount rate applied is the \\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC). DCF calculation is performed as follows:\\ntfuture free cash ﬂows are discounted over the explicit forecast period, i.e. the period \\nover which there is visibility on the company’s operations;\\nt a discounted terminal value is calculated on the basis of an estimated growth rate \\ncarried to perpetuity;\\nt the value of equity is the difference between the enterprise value obtained above and \\nthe value of the company’s net debt.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

In this approach, the enterprise value \\nof the company is estimated via a multiple of its proﬁt-generating capacity before interest \\nexpense. EBIT and EBITDA multiples are among those commonly used. The multiple used in \\nthe comparison can be either a market multiple or a transaction multiple. The value of net \\ndebt is deducted from this enterprise value to get the value of equity. Equity can also be \\ndirectly valued through a multiple of net income, cash ﬂow or book equity.\\nThe sum-of-the-parts method of valuation consists in valuing and summing up each of \\nthe company’s assets, subsidiaries or divisions and subtracting liabilities. There are sev-\\neral types of net asset value, from liquidation value to going-concern value, and there \\nare important tax considerations. Either capital gains or losses will be subject to tax or \\ndepreciable assets will be undervalued and yearly taxes higher. Calculating net asset value \\nmakes sense only if it includes the company’s intangible assets, which can be particularly \\ndifﬁcult to value.\\nNo company valuation is complete without an analysis of the reasons for the differences in \\nthe results obtained by the various valuation methods. These differences give rise to deci-\\nsions of ﬁnancial engineering and evolve throughout the life of the company. To the ﬁnancial \\nmanager, the market for corporate control is nothing but a segment of the broader capital \\nmarket. From this principle it follows that there is no such thing as control value other than \\nthe strategic value deriving from synergies.\\nIndustrial synergies generally make a company’s strategic value higher than its ﬁnancial or \\nstandalone value.

That is to say, is there a “right” combination of equity and debt that \\nallows us to reduce the weighted average cost of capital and therefore to maximise the \\nvalue of capital employed (enterprise value)?\\nThe reader may be surprised by this question when Chapter 13 showed clearly how \\nreturn on equity could benefit from the leverage effect. But again we recall  that we have \\nnow left the world of accounting in order to enter the universe of finance.\\nJumping directly to the conclusion, this part of the book could be renamed “the use-\\nlessness of the leverage effect in finance”!\\nNote that we consider the weighted average cost of capital (or cost of capital), \\ndenoted k, to be the rate of return required by all the company’s investors either to buy or \\nto hold its securities. It is the company’s cost of financing and the minimum return \\nits  investments must generate in the medium term. If not, the company is heading \\nfor ruin.\\nkD is the rate of return required by lenders of a given company, kE is the cost of equity \\nrequired by the company’s shareholders, and k is the weighted average rate of the two \\ntypes of financing, equity and net debt (from now on often referred to simply as debt). The \\nweighting reflects the breakdown of equity and debt in enterprise value.\\nWith VD, the market value of net debt, and VE the market value of equity, we get:\\nkk V\\nVV k V\\nVV=× − × +\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟+× +\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟D\\nD\\nDE\\nE\\nE\\nDE\\n()1T c\\nor, since the enterprise value is equal to that of net debt plus equity (EV = V = VE + VD):\\nkk V\\nV k V\\nV=× − × ⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟+× ⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜⎜⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟⎟⎟⎟Dc\\nD\\nE\\nET()1\\nIf, for example, the rate of return required by the company’s creditors is 5% and that \\nrequired by shareholders 10% and the value of debt is equal to that of equity, the return \\nrequired by all of the company’s sources of funding will be 7.5%. Its weighted average \\ncost of capital is thus 7.5%.'),\n",

This enables us to apply perpetual bond \\nanalytics and, more importantly, to assume that the company’s capital structure remains \\nunchanged during the life of the project; income being distributed in full. The assumption \\nof an infinite horizon is just a convention designed to simplify our calculations and dem-\\nonstrations, but they remain accurate within a limited time horizon (say, for simplicity, \\n15–20 years).\\nSection 32.1\\nTHE VALUE OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED\\nWhile accounting looks at a company by examining its past and focusing on its costs, \\nfinance is mainly a projection of the company into the future. Finance reflects not only \\nrisk but also – and above all – the value that results from the perception of risk and future \\nreturns.\\nIn ﬁnance, everything is about the future – return, risk and value.\\nFrom now on, we will speak constantly of value. As we saw previously, by value we mean \\nthe present value of future cash flows discounted at the rate of return required by \\ninvestors:\\nt equity (E) will be replaced by the value of equity (VE );\\nt net debt (D) will be replaced by the value of net debt (VD );\\nt capital employed (CE) will be replaced by enterprise value (EV), or firm value.\\nWe will speak in terms of a financial assessment of the company (rather than the account-\\ning assessment provided by the balance sheet). Our financial assessment will include only \\nthe market values of assets and liabilities:\\nENTERPRISE VALUE or FIRM VALUE \\n(EV)\\nVALUE OF NET DEBT\\n(VD)\\nEQUITY VALUE\\n(VE)\\nAs operating assets are financed by equity and net debt (which are accounting con-\\ncepts), logically, a company’s enterprise value will consist of the market value of net debt \\nand the market value of equity (which are financial concepts). This chapter therefore \\nreasons in terms of:\\nEnterprise value = Value of net debt + Equity value\\nImportant: Enterprise value is sometimes confused with equity value.

Enterprise \\nvalue and ﬁrm value are synonymous.\\nSimilarly, we will reason not in terms of return on equity, but rather required rate of return, \\nwhich was discussed in depth in Chapter 19. In other words, the accounting notions of \\nROCE (return on capital employed), ROE (return on equity) andi (cost of debt) ,\\nwhich are based on past observations, will give way to W ACC ork (required rate of \\nreturn on capital employed), kE (required rate of return on equity) and kD (required \\nrate of return of net debt) , which are the returns required by those investors who are \\nfinancing the company.\\nSection 32.2\\nDEBT AND EQUITY\\nThe fundamental differences between debt and equity should now be crystal clear:\\ntDebt:\\n○ provide a return for the investor that is independent from the performance of \\nthe firm. Except in extreme cases (default, bankruptcy), the lender will earn the \\ninterest due (no more, no less) regardless of whether the earnings of the company \\nare excellent, average or bad;\\n○ always have a term, even if remote in time, that is defined contractually. We will \\nnot consider for the time being the rare cases of perpetual debts (which are usu-\\nally only named so, when you analyse them more carefully);\\n○ are repaid in priority to equity in case of liquidation of the company: the proceeds \\nof the sale of assets will primarily go to lenders, and only if and when lenders \\nhave been fully repaid will shareholders receive cash.\\nt Equity:\\n○ yields returns depending on the profitability of the company. Dividends and capi-\\ntal gains will be nil if the results are not good;\\n○ does not benefit from a repayment commitment. The only exit for equity can \\nbe found by selling to a new shareholder which will take over the role from the \\nprevious one;\\n○ in case of bankruptcy is repaid only after all creditors have been fully repaid. Our \\nreaders probably know that in most cases, the proceeds from liquidation are not \\nsufficient to repay 100% of creditors. Shareholders are then left with nothing as \\nthe company is insolvent.\\nShareholders fully run the risk of the firm as the cash flows generated by the capital \\nemployed (free cash flows to the firm) will first be allocated to lenders; only when they \\nhave collected what is due will shareholders be entitled to the remainder.\\nGiven these elements, it becomes natural that the voting rights and therefore the \\nright to choose management lies in the hand of shareholders. Shareholders have a vested \\ninterest that capital employed be managed in an optimal manner by management so that \\nit generates high cash flows after the service of debt (interest and capital repayments).'),\n",

It is only because shareholders are second to \\nlenders in the collection of cash flows generated by the capital employed, hence running \\nthe risk of the firm, that they benefit from voting rights.\\nThe higher the enterprise value, the higher also the equity value. As debt does not run \\nthe risk of the firm (except in case of financial distress), its value will largely be indepen-\\ndent from the changes in enterprise value.

The demonstrations \\nbelow endeavour to measure and explain changes in k according to the company’s capital \\nstructure.'),\n",

This enables the \\ncompany to minimise its weighted average cost of capital – that is, the cost of ﬁnancing.\\nWe know that ex ante debt is always cheaper than equity (kD < kE ) because it is less risky. \\nConsequently, a moderate increase in debt will help reduce k, since a more expensive \\nresource – equity – is being replaced by a cheaper one – debt. This is the practical applica-\\ntion of the preceding formula and the use of leverage.\\nHowever, any increase in debt also increases the risk for the shareholder. Markets \\nthen demand a higher kE the more debt we add in the capital structure. The increase in \\nthe expected rate of return on equity cancels out part (or all, if the firm becomes highly \\nleveraged!) of the decrease in cost arising on the recourse to debt. More specifically, the \\ntraditional theory claims that a certain level of debt gives rise to a very real risk of bank-\\nruptcy. Rather than remaining constant, shareholders’ perception of risk evolves in stages.\\nThe risk accruing to shareholders increases in step with that of debt, prompting the \\nmarket to demand a higher return on equity. This process continues until it has cancelled \\nout the positive impact of the debt financing.\\nAt this level of financial leverage, the company has achieved the optimal capital \\nstructure ensuring the lowest weighted average cost of capital and thus the highest enter-\\nprise value. Should the company continue to take on debt, the resulting gains would no \\nlonger offset the higher return required by the market.\\nMoreover, the cost of debt increases after a certain level because it becomes more \\nrisky. At this point, not only has the company’s cost of equity increased, but also of that \\nof its debt.\\nIn short, the evidence from the “real world” shows that an optimal capital structure \\ncan be achieved with some – but not too much – leverage.\\nIn this example, the debt-to-equity ratio that minimises k is 0.4. The optimal capital \\nstructure is thus achieved with 40% debt financing and 60% equity financing.\\nAccording to \\nthe traditional \\napproach, an \\noptimal capital \\nstructure can be \\nachieved where \\nthe weighted \\naverage cost of \\ncapital is minimal.\\n0\\n0\\n5%\\n10%Expected returns\\nConventional approach to optimal capital structure\\n15%\\n20%\\n0.2 0.4\\nOptimal capital structure\\n0.6 0.8 VD/V\\nkD\\nkE\\nk'),\n",

It \\nstates that, barring any distortions, there is no one optimal capital structure.\\nWe shall demonstrate this proposition by means of an example given by Franco Modi-\\ngliani and Merton Miller (MM), who showed that, in a perfect market and without \\ntaxes, the traditional approach is incorrect. If there is no optimal capital structure, \\nthe overall cost of equity  (k or W ACC) remains the same regardless of the firm’s \\ndebt policy.\\nThe main assumptions behind the theorem are:\\n1. companies can issue only two types of securities: risk-free debt and equity;\\n2. financial markets are frictionless;\\n3. there is no corporate and personal taxation;\\n4. there are no transaction costs;\\n5. firms cannot go bankrupt;\\n6.insiders and outsiders have the same set of information.\\nAccording to MM, investors can take on debt just like companies. So, in a perfect market, \\nthey have no reason to pay companies to do something they can handle themselves at no cost.\\nImagine two companies that are completely identical except for their capital struc-\\nture. The value of their respective debt and equity differs, but the sum of both, i.e. the \\nenterprise value of each company, is the same. If the reverse were true, equilibrium would \\nbe restored by arbitrage.\\nWe shall demonstrate this using the examples of companies X and Y, which are iden-\\ntical except that X is unlevered and Y carries debt of 80 000 at 5%. If the traditional \\napproach were correct, Y’s weighted average cost of capital would be lower than that of X\\nand its enterprise value higher:\\nCompany X Company Y\\nOperating proﬁt: EBIT 20 000 20 000\\nInterest expense (at 5%): IE 0 4000\\nNet proﬁt: NP 20 000 16 000\\nDividend: DIV = NP1 20 000 16 000\\nCost of equity: kE 10% 12%\\nEquity: VE = DIV/kE\\n2 200 000 133 333\\nDebt: VD = IE/kD\\n2 0 80 000\\nEnterprise value: V = VE + VD 200 000 213 333\\nWeighted average cost of capital: k = EBIT/V2 10% 9.4%\\nGearing : VD/VE 0% 60%\\n1 To simplify \\ncalculations, the \\npayout ratio is \\n100%.\\n2To simplify \\ncalculations, we \\nadopt an infinite \\nhorizon.\\nY’s cost of equity is higher than that of X since Y’s shareholders bear both the operating \\nrisk and that of the capital structure (debt), whereas X’s shareholders incur only the same \\noperating risk. As a matter of fact, the operating risk of X is the same as that of Y, as X and \\nY are identical but for their capital structures.'),\n",

However, the personal \\nwealth invested by our shareholder is still the same (1333).\\nFormerly, the investor received annual dividends of 160 from company Y (12% × \\n1333 or 1% of 16 000). Now, his net income on the same investment will be:\\nDividends (company X)\\n− Interest expense\\n= Net income\\n2133 10 213\\n800 5 40\\n173\\n×=\\n×=\\n=\\n%\\n%\\nHe is now earning 173 every year instead of the former 160, on the same personal amount \\ninvested and with the same level of risk.\\nY’s shareholders will thus sell their Y shares to invest in X shares, reducing the value \\nof Y’s equity and increasing that of X. This arbitrage will cease as soon as the enterprise \\nvalues of the two companies come into line again.\\nThus, barring any distortions, the enterprise value of a company must be independent \\nof its ﬁnancing policy.\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\\n0%\\n5%\\n10%\\n15%\\n20%\\nRequired rate of return\\n25%\\n30%\\nVD/V\\nkD\\nkE\\nk'),\n",

The answer is simple: as leverage increases, risk for shareholders increases \\ntoo and they require a higher cost of equity. The increased leverage is counterbalanced by \\nthe increase in cost of equity.\\nWe can easily erase the assumption of no distress cost. In this case, Modigliani and \\nMiller’s proposition still stands: enterprise value does not depend on capital structure.\\nIn this context, cost of debt ( kD) actually increases with leverage, as debtholders \\nsuffer an increasing risk of bankruptcy.

And yet it should be easy to \\nremember: the value of an asset, be it a factory, a painting, a subsidiary or a house, is the \\nsame regardless of whether it was financed by debt, equity or a combination of the two. \\nAs Merton Miller explained when receiving the Nobel Prize for Economics, “it is the size \\nof the pizza that matters, not how many slices it is cut up into.” Or, to restate this: the \\nweighted average cost of capital does not depend on the sources of financing.

True, shareholders will pay less for the shares of a levered company, but \\nthey will have to pay back the debt (or buy it back, which amounts to the same thing) \\nbefore obtaining access to the enterprise value. In the end, they will have paid, directly \\nor indirectly, the same amount (value of equity plus repayment of net debt1); that is, the \\nenterprise value.\\nNow, what about the financial manager who must issue securities to finance the \\ncreation of enterprise value? It does not matter whether he issues only shares or a combina-\\ntion of bonds and shares, since again the proceeds will be the same – the enterprise value.\\nEnterprise value depends on future flows and how the related, non-diversifiable risks \\nare perceived by the market.\\nBut if that is the case, why diversify sources of financing? The preceding theory is \\ncertainly elegant, but it cannot fully explain how things actually work in real life.\\nIn this chapter we look at two basic explanations of real-life happenings . First of \\nall, within the same market logic, biases occur which may explain why companies borrow \\nfunds, and why they stop at a certain level. The fundamental factors from which these \\nbiases spring are taxes and financial distress costs. Their joint analysis will give birth \\nto the “tradeoff model”.\\nThere are features of debt that can modify the optimal capital structure. Tradeoff \\nmodels generally limit their attention to the pros and cons of tax shields and financial \\ndistress costs. We believe that the elements of the balance are more numerous than just \\nthese factors. Other factors may also be added:\\ntinformation asymmetries;\\nt disciplining role of debt;\\nt financial flexibility;\\nt agency costs;\\nt signalling aspects.\\nMaybe the main reasons for the interference between capital structure and investment are \\nthe divergent interests of the various financial partners regarding value creation and their \\ndiffering levels of access to information. This lies at the core of the manager/shareholder \\n1 Again, we use \\nnet debt and debt \\nsynonymously.'),\n",

A full chapter (Chapter 34) is devoted to \\nan analysis of the capital structure resulting from a compromise between creditors and \\nshareholders.\\nRather than being simply a search for value, the choice of ﬁnancing is far more an \\nendeavour to reduce conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and managers or share-\\nholders and lenders, as well as the information asymmetry between management and \\ninvestors.\\nSection 33.1\\nTHE BENEFITS OF DEBT OR THE TRADEOFF MODEL\\n1/ CORPORATE INCOME TAXES\\nUp to now, our reasoning was based on a tax-free world, which of course does not exist. \\nThe investor’s net return can be two to five times (or more) lower than the pre-tax cash \\nflows of an industrial investment.\\nIt would therefore be foolhardy to ignore taxation, which forces financial managers \\nto devote a considerable amount of their time to tax optimisation.\\nFor financial managers, this chapter will cover familiar ground and our insistence on \\nthe importance of tax aspects in every financial decision will seem obvious.\\nBut we ought not go to the other extreme and concentrate solely on tax variables. \\nAll too many decisions based entirely on tax considerations lead to ridiculous outcomes, \\nsuch as insufficient earnings capacity. Tax deficits alone are no reason to buy a company!\\nIn 1963, Modigliani and Miller pushed their initial demonstration further, but this \\ntime they factored in corporate income tax ( but no other taxes) in an economy in which \\ncompanies’ financial expenses are tax-deductible, but not dividends. This is pretty much \\nthe case in most countries.\\nThe conclusion was unmistakable: once you factor in corporate income tax, there is \\nmore incentive to use debt rather than equity financing.\\nInterest expenses can be deducted from the company’s tax base, so that creditors \\nreceive their coupon payments before they have been taxed. Dividends, on the other hand, \\nare not deductible and are paid to shareholders after taxation.\\nThus, a debt-free company with equity financing of 100 on which shareholders \\nrequire a 10% return will have to generate profit of at least 15.4 in order to provide the \\nrequired return of 10 after a 35% tax.\\nIf, however, its financing is equally divided between debt at 5% interest and equity, \\na profit of 13.6 will be enough to satisfy shareholders despite the premium for the greater \\nrisk to shares created by the debt (i.e. 14.4%).\\n  Operating proﬁt 13.6\\n−Interest expense 2.5\\n= Pre-tax proﬁt 11.1\\n− 35% tax 3.9\\n= Net proﬁt 7.2 or 14.4% of 50'),\n",

Interest expenses will be 2.5 each year. Assuming \\na 35% tax rate and an operating profit of more than 2.5 regardless of the year under review \\n(an amount sufficient to benefit from the tax savings), the tax savings will be 35% × 2.5 \\nor 0.88 for each year. The present value of this perpetual bond increases shareholders’ \\nwealth by 0.88/14.4% = 6.1 if 14.4% is the cost of equity.

Should we use the cost of debt, as Modigliani \\nand Miller did in their article in 1963, the weighted average cost of capital or the cost of \\nequity?\\nUsing the cost of debt is justified if we are certain that the tax savings are permanent. \\nIn addition, this allows us to use a particularly simple formula:\\nValue of the tax savings = CDD\\nD\\nCD\\nTkV\\nk TV×× =×\\nNevertheless, there are good reasons to prefer to discount the savings at the cost of equity, \\nsince it would be difficult to assume that the company will continually carry the same \\ndebt, generate profits and be taxed at the same rate.

If the worst comes to the worst, the company files for bankruptcy, \\nwhich in the final analysis simply means that assets are reallocated to more profitable \\nventures.\\nIn fact, the bankruptcy of an unprofitable company strengthens the sector and \\nimproves the profitability of the remaining firms and therefore their value. Bankruptcy \\nis a useful mechanism which helps the market stay healthier by eliminating the least \\nefficient companies.\\nThe public authorities would do well to apply this reasoning. Better to let a  troubled \\nsector rid itself of its lame ducks than to keep them artificially afloat, which in turn  creates \\ndifficulties for the healthy, efficient firms to the point where they, too, may become \\n financially distressed.\\nFor investors with a well-diversified portfolio, the cost of the bankruptcy will be \\nnil, since when a company is discontinued, its assets (market share, customers, factories, \\netc.) are taken over by others who will manage them better. One person’s loss is another \\nperson’s gain! If the investor has a diversified portfolio, the capital losses will be offset \\nby other capital gains.\\nIn practice, however, markets are not perfect and we all know that even if  \\nbankruptcies are a means of reallocating resources, they carry a very real cost to those \\ninvolved. These include:\\n t Direct costs: redundancy payments, legal fees, administrative costs, shareholders’ \\nefforts to receive a liquidation dividend.\\n t Indirect costs: order cancellations (for fear they will not be honoured), less trade \\ncredit (because it may not be repaid), reduced productivity (strikes, underutilisation \\nof production capacity), no more access to financing (even for profitable projects); as \\nwell as incalculable human costs.\\nOne could say bankruptcy occurs when shareholders refuse to inject more funds once \\nthey have concluded that their initial investment is lost. In essence, they are handing the \\ncompany over to its creditors, who then become the new shareholders. The creditors bear \\nall the costs of the malfunctioning company, thus further reducing their chances of getting \\nrepaid.\\nEven without going to the extremes of bankruptcy, a highly levered company in \\nfinancial distress faces certain costs that reduce its value. It may have to cut back on  \\nR&D expenditure, maintenance, training or marketing expenses in order to meet its debt \\npayments and will find it increasingly difficult to raise new funding, even for profitable \\ninvestment projects.\\nAfter factoring all these costs into the equation, we can say that:\\nValue\\nof levered\\nfirm\\nValue of\\nunlevered\\nfirm\\nPresent value of\\n=+ tthe tax shield\\narising on debt\\nPresent value of\\nbankruptcy − ccosts and\\nmalfunction costs'),\n",

A levered company may be \\nworth more than if it had only equity financing. However, there are two good reasons why \\nthis advantage should not be overstated. Firstly, when a company with excessive debt is \\nin financial distress, its tax advantage disappears, since it no longer generates sufficient \\nprofits. Secondly, the high debt level may lead to restructuring costs and lost investment \\nopportunities if financing is no longer available. As a result, debt should not exceed a \\ncertain level.\\nParadoxically, this long detour brings us back to our starting point – the conventional \\napproach which says “Some debt is fine, but not too much.”4\\nThe theoretical optimal debt ratio appears to be when the present value of the tax sav-\\nings arising on additional borrowing is offset by the increase in the present value of \\nﬁnancial distress and bankruptcy costs.\\nIn 2000, Graham found that the value of the tax advantage of interest expenses is around \\n9.7%, and it goes down to 4.3% if personal taxation of investors is also considered. \\nAlmeida and Philippon (2007) have, on the other hand, estimated the bankruptcy costs; \\nthey believe the right percentage is around 4.5% – in brief, it seems that one effect “per-\\nfectly” compensates the other. In 2010, Van Binsbergen, Graham and Yang, and Korteweg \\nfound similar results.\\n4 See\\nChapter 33.'),\n",

A word of caution, however. Corporate managers who focus too \\nnarrowly on reducing tax charges may end up making the wrong decisions.\\n3/ INTRODUCING  PERSONAL  TAXES , A MAJOR  IMPROVEMENT   \\nTO THE  PREVIOUS  REASONING\\nIn 1977, Miller released a new study in which he revisited the observation made with \\nModigliani in 1958 that there is no one optimal capital structure. This time, however, he \\nfactored in both corporate and personal taxes.\\nMiller claimed that the taxes paid by investors can cancel out those paid by compa-\\nnies. This would mean that the value of the firm would remain the same regardless of the \\ntype of financing used. Again, there should be no optimal capital structure.\\nMiller based his argument on the assumption that equity income is not taxed, and that \\nthe tax rate on interest income is marginally equal to the corporate tax rate.\\nBut these assumptions are shaky, since in reality investors are not all taxed at the \\nsame marginal rate and both equity returns and the capital gains on disposal of shares are \\ntaxed as well. In fact, Miller’s objective was to demonstrate that real life is far more com-\\nplicated than the simplified assumptions applied in the theories and models. The value \\nof the tax shield is not so big as the 1963 article would have us believe. Suppose that, in \\naddition to the corporate income tax (TC) that there are also two other tax rates:\\nTD = personal tax rate on interest income;\\nTE = personal tax rate on dividends.\\nIf we:\\n 1. consider the cash flows net of all taxes that shareholders and creditors must pay to \\ntax authorities;\\n 2. sum them; and\\n 3. rearrange terms,\\nthe “complete” tax shield (G) is:\\nG TT\\nT V=− −× −\\n−\\n⎡\\n⎣\\n⎢⎢\\n⎤\\n⎦\\n⎥⎥×1 11\\n1\\n() ()\\n()\\nCE\\nD\\nD\\nThe reader will immediately notice that if TE = TD the tax shield turns back to the “origi-\\nnal” TC – VD.\\nIn our last example, if TE is zero, TD = 30% and TC = 35%, G is still positive but \\nmuch lower because it equals only 0.0714 (or 7.14%).'),\n",

Say a company has an enterprise value of 1000. Regardless of its type of \\nfinancing, investors require a 6% return after corporate and personal income taxes. Bear \\nin mind that this rate is not comparable with that determined by the CAPM ( rF + β ×\\n(rM − rF)), which is calculated before personal taxation.\\nLet’s take a country where (realistically) the main tax rates are:\\nt corporate tax: 34.43%;\\nt tax on dividends: 12%;\\nt capital gains tax: 12%;\\nt tax on interest income: 30%.\\nNow let us assume that the company has an operating profit of 103.

For \\nexample, in Germany, Spain and Italy, interest is deductible only up to 30% of EBITDA, \\nin France only 75% of interest is deductible.\\nIn other countries, to make equity financing more attractive, firms can deduct notional \\ninterest computed on equity from taxable income. This is the case in Belgium and Brazil.\\nSection 33.2\\nDEBT TO CONTROL MANAGEMENT\\n1/ DEBT AS A MEANS OF CONTROLLING CORPORATE MANAGERS\\nNow let us examine the interests of non-shareholder executives.

Debt financing avoids this trap, since the debt repayment prevents \\nsurplus cash from accumulating. Shareholders encourage debt as well because it stimu-\\nlates performance. The more debt a company has, the higher its risk. In the event of finan-\\ncial difficulties, corporate executives may lose their jobs and the attendant compensation \\npackage and remuneration in kind. This threat is considered to be sufficiently dissuasive \\nto encourage sound management, generating optimal liquidity to service the debt and \\nengage in profitable investments.\\nThe explicit cost of debt is a simple yet highly effective means of controlling a ﬁrm’s \\nmanagement team. Large groups are well aware of the leverage this gives them and \\nrequire the executives of their main subsidiaries to carry a level of “incentive debt” \\nwhich is charged to the subsidiary.\\nGiven that the parameters of debt are reflected in a company’s cash situation while equity \\nfinancing translates into capital gains or losses at shareholder level, management will be \\nparticularly intent on the success of its debt-financed investment projects. This is another, \\nindirect, limitation of the perfect markets theory: since the various forms of financing \\ndo not offer the same incentives to corporate executives, financing does indeed influ-\\nence the choice of investment.\\nThis would indicate that a levered company is more flexible and responsive than an \\nunlevered company. This hypothesis was tested and proven by Ofek, who show that the \\nmore debt they carry, the faster listed US companies react to a crisis, by filing for bank-\\nruptcy, curtailing dividend payouts or reducing the payroll.\\nDebt is thus an internal means of controlling management preferred by shareholders. \\nIn Chapter 44 we shall see that another is the threat of a takeover bid.\\nHowever, the use of debt has its limits. When a group’s corporate structure becomes \\ntotally unbalanced, debt no longer acts as an incentive for management. On the contrary, \\nthe corporate manager will be tempted to continue expanding via debt until his group has \\nbecome too big to fail, like RBS, Fortis, AIG, Citi, etc. until the concept of too big to fail \\nis tested (Lehman). This risk is called “moral hazard”.\\n2/ LBOS, THIS LOGIC ’S PUSHED TO THE LIMITS\\nSome sectors are being restructured through LBO transactions which we will look at in \\nfurther detail in Chapter 46. An LBO is the acquisition, generally by management (MBO), \\nof all of a company’s shares using borrowed funds. It becomes a leveraged buildup if \\nit then uses debt to buy other companies in order to increase its standing in the sector. \\nIt is generally thought that the purpose of the funds devoted to LBOs is to use account-\\ning leverage to obtain better returns. In fact, the success of LBOs cannot be attributed \\nto accounting leverage, since we have already seen that this alone does not create value.\\nThe real reason for the success of LBOs is that, when it has a stake in the company, \\nmanagement is far more committed to making the company a success. With management \\nmost often holding a share of the equity, resource allocation will be designed to benefit \\nshareholders. Executives have a two-fold incentive: to enhance their existing or future (in \\nthe case of stock options) stake in the capital and to safeguard their jobs and reputation by \\nensuring that the company does not go broke. It thus becomes a classic case of the carrot \\nand the stick!'),\n",

Jensen (1986) demonstrated that, in the absence of heavy \\ndebt, the executives of such companies will be strongly tempted to use the substantial free \\ncash flow to grow to the detriment of profits by overinvesting or diversifying into other \\nbusinesses, two strategies that destroy value.\\nThe only value created by debt is the fact that it forces managers to improve enterprise \\nvalue.\\nSection 33.3\\nSIGNALLING AND DEBT POLICY\\nSignalling theory is based on the strong assumption that corporate managers are better \\ninformed about their companies than the suppliers of funding. This means that they are in \\na better position to foresee the company’s future flows and know what state their company \\nis in. Consequently, any signal they send indicating that flows will be better than expected \\nor that risks will be lower may enable the investor to create value. Investors are therefore \\nconstantly on the watch for such signals. But for the signals to be credible there must be \\na penalty for the wrong signals in order to dissuade companies from deliberately mislead-\\ning the market.\\nIn the context of information asymmetry, markets would not understand why a corpo-\\nrate manager would borrow to undertake a very risky and unprofitable venture. After all, \\nif the venture fails, he risks losing his job or worse, if the venture causes the company to \\nfail. So debt is a strong signal for profitability, but even more for risk. It is unlikely that a \\nCEO would resort to debt financing if he knew that in a worst-case scenario he would not \\nbe able to repay the debt.\\nRoss (1977) has demonstrated that any change in financing policy changes investors’ \\nperception of the company and is therefore a market signal.\\nIt is thus obvious that an increase in debt increases the risk on equity. The managers \\nof a company that has raised its gearing rate are, in effect, signalling to the markets that \\nthey are aware of the state of nature, that it is favourable and that they are confident that \\nthe company’s performance will allow them to pay the additional financial expenses and \\npay back the new debt.\\nThis signal carries its own penalty if it is wrong. If the signal is false, i.e. if the com-\\npany’s actual prospects are not good at all, the extra debt will create financial difficulties \\nthat will ultimately lead, in one form or another, to the dismissal of its executives.5 In this \\nscheme, managers have a strong incentive to send the correct signal by ensuring that the \\nfirm’s debt corresponds to their understanding of its repayment capacity.\\nRoss has shown that, assuming managers have privileged information about their own \\ncompany, they will send the correct signal on the condition that the marginal gain derived \\nfrom an incorrect signal is lower than the sanction suffered if the company is liquidated.\\n“They put their money where their mouths are.” This explains why debt policies vary \\nfrom one company to the other: they simply reflect the variable prospects of the individual \\ncompanies.\\nThe actual capital structure of a ﬁrm is not necessarily a signal, but any change in it \\ncertainly is.\\n5 Note that a \\nbad manager \\nwhose forecast of \\nfuture flows was \\nunintentionally\\nwrong will be \\nsanctioned just \\nas much as one \\nwho deliberately \\nsent the wrong \\nsignal.'),\n",

The market reasons that corporate managers would \\nnot increase capital if, based on the inside information available to them, they thought \\nit was undervalued, since this would dilute the existing shareholdings in unfavourable \\nconditions. If there is no pressing reason for the capital increase, investors will infer that, \\nbased on their inside information, the managers consider the share price to be too high \\nand that this is why the existing shareholders have accepted the capital increase. On the \\nother hand, research has shown too, that the announcement of a bond issue has no material \\nimpact on share prices.\\nIt follows that the sale of a manager’s stake in the company is a very negative signal. \\nIt reveals that he has internal information indicating that the value of future flows, taking \\nrisk into account, is lower than the proceeds he expects from the sale of his investment. \\nConversely, any increase in the stake, especially if financed by debt, constitutes a very \\npositive signal for the market.\\nThis explains why financial investors prefer to subscribe to capital increases rather \\nthan buy from existing shareholders. It is also the reason why every year in the US, the \\nUK, France and many other countries, top managers and all directors must disclose the \\nnumber of shares they hold or control in the companies they work for or of which they \\nare board members.\\nSection 33.4\\nINFORMATION ASYMMETRIES AND THE PECKING ORDER THEORY\\nHaving established that information asymmetry carries a cost, our next task is to deter-\\nmine what type of financing carries the lowest cost in this respect. \\nThe uncontested champion is, of course, internal financing, which requires no special \\nprocedures. Its advantage is simplicity.\\nDebt comes next, but only low-risk debt with plenty of guarantees (pledges) and \\ncovenants restricting the risk to creditors and thus making it more palatable to them. This \\nis followed by riskier forms of debt and hybrid securities.\\nCapital increases come last, because they are automatically interpreted as a negative \\nsignal. To counter this, the information asymmetry must be reduced by means of road \\nshows, one-to-one meetings, prospectuses and advertising campaigns. Investors have to \\nbe persuaded that the issue offers good value for money!\\nIn an article published in 1984, Myers elaborates on a theory initially put forward \\nby Donaldson in 1961, stating that, according to this pecking order theory, companies \\nprioritise their sources of financing.\\nAs can be seen, although the corporate manager does not choose the type of financing \\narbitrarily, he does so without great enthusiasm, since they all carry the same cost relative \\nto their risk.\\nThe pecking order is determined by the law of least effort. Managers do not have to \\n“raise” internal financing, and they will always endeavour to limit intermediation costs, \\nwhich are the highest on share issues.\\nIn Chapter 35, we shall focus on these issues to illustrate how to reach an appropriate \\ndesign of the capital structure of a company. After having explored the bulk of the theory, \\nthe time will come to examine details.

The optimal capital structure is thus one which includes a \\nmaximum amount of debt, and the value of a levered company is equal to what it would be \\nwithout the debt, plus the amount of savings generated by the tax shield.\\nThere are, however, two major drawbacks to this approach. Firstly, the higher a company’s \\ndebts, the greater the probability of bankruptcy costs, whether direct or indirect (proﬁtable \\ninvestments that are not made). Secondly, if the personal tax situation of the investor is \\ntaken into account, this offsets the tax shield that debt enjoys at a corporate level. For \\nindividual taxpayers, the tax breaks on income on equity are better than they are for debt.\\nProblems stemming from information asymmetry between shareholders and investors have an \\nobvious impact on the choice of capital structure. Managers believing that their companies \\nare undervalued would prefer to increase debt levels rather than to issue new shares at a low \\nprice, and possibly carry out a capital increase once the share price has gone up. Similarly, a \\ndecision to use debt ﬁnance for a project is a sign of management’s conﬁdence in its ability \\nto meet payments on the debt and an indirect sign that the project is likely to be proﬁtable.\\nPushing the information asymmetry problem to the limit brings us to the pecking order \\ntheory, which holds that managers choose sources of ﬁnancing on the basis of the amount \\nof intermediation costs and agency costs: cash ﬂow, debt and only then a capital increase. \\nFinally, according to agency theory, debt is analysed as an internal means of controlling \\nmanagement, which has to work hard to ensure that debt repayments are met. For a mature \\ncompany making healthy proﬁts but without major growth prospects, incurring large debts is \\na way of discouraging managers from spending cash on risky diversiﬁcation projects or rash \\nexpansion projects, which both destroy value. The LBO, an innovation of the 1980s, is what \\nhas come out of this theory. LBOs create value, not on the basis of the accounting illusion of \\nthe leverage effect, but thanks to the high motivation of managers who are under pressure to \\nrepay debts, and who have a ﬁnancial incentive to work harder as a result of the potentially \\nvery lucrative proﬁt-sharing schemes that have been set up. This takes us a long way from \\nthe simplistic assumptions made in the ﬁrst models designed by Modigliani and Miller!\\nSUMMARY\\n1/According to the approach by Modigliani and Miller (1963), how does the value of a \\nlevered company differ from the value of an unlevered company?\\n2/What are the two drawbacks to Modigliani and Miller’s 1963 theory?\\n3/What is Modigliani and Miller’s 1977 theory based on and what conclusions do they draw?\\n4/Describe the tax breaks for debt financing and for equity financing.\\n5/What are the latest tax trends with regard to sources of financing?\\n6/What is the value of a levered company when there is a strong likelihood that it will file \\nfor bankruptcy?\\n7/What is your view of the following statement: “ X went bankrupt because its financial \\nexpenses amounted to 13% of its sales”?\\nQUESTIONS'),\n",

However, there is \\na big difference between the 10% return required by creditors and that required by \\nshareholders.\\nShareholders simply hope to achieve this rate, which forms an average of rates that \\ncan be either positive or negative. The actual return can range from 0% to infinity, with \\nthe entire range of variations in between!\\nCreditors are assured of receiving the required rate, but never more. They can only \\nhope to earn the 10% return but, with a few exceptions, this hope is almost always \\nfulfilled. So here we have the first distinction between creditors and shareholders: the \\nprobability distribution of their remuneration is completely different.\\nThat said, although the creditor’s risk is very low, it is not nil. Capitalism is built on \\nthe concept of corporation, which legally restricts shareholders’ liability with respect \\nto creditors. When a company defaults, shareholders hold a “trump card” that allows \\nthem to hand the company, including its liabilities, over to the lenders.\\nThe main ﬁnancial innovation of the 19th century is the corporation.\\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will concentrate on the valuation of companies in which \\nshareholders’ responsibility is limited to the amount they have invested . This applies to \\nthe vast majority of all companies in modern capitalism, be they corporations, limited \\nliability companies or sole proprietorship with limited liability.\\nThis is the fundamental difference between shareholders and creditors: the former \\ncan lose their entire investment, but also hope for unlimited gains, while the latter will at \\nbest earn the flows programmed at the beginning of the contract.\\nKeep this in mind as we use options to analyse corporate structure and, more impor-\\ntantly, the relationship between shareholders and creditors.\\nSection 34.1\\nANALYSING THE FIRM IN LIGHT OF OPTIONS THEORY\\nTo keep our presentation simple, we shall take the example of a joint stock company in \\nwhich enterprise value EV is divided between debt (VD) and equity (VE).'),\n",

In this case, the shareholders let the company repay the lenders and take \\nthe residual value of 20.\\nt The enterprise value is lower than the amount of debt to be redeemed (e.g. EV = 70). \\nThe shareholders may then invoke their limited liability clause, forfeiting only their \\ninvestment, and transfer the company to the lenders who will bear the difference \\nbetween the enterprise value and their claim.\\nNow let us analyse this situation in terms of options. From an economic standpoint, share-\\nholders have a call option (known as a European call if it can only be exercised at the end \\nof its life) on the firm’s assets. Its features are:\\ntUnderlying asset = capital employed.\\nt Exercise price = amount of debt to be reimbursed (100).\\nt Volatility = volatility of the underlying assets, i.e. the capital employed.\\nt Maturity = expiration date.\\nt Interest rate = risk-free rate corresponding to the maturity of the option.\\nAt the expiration date, shareholders exercise their call option and repay the lenders, or \\nthey abandon it. The value of the option is none other than the value of equity (VE).\\nFrom the shareholder’s point of view, when a company borrows funds, it is selling its \\n“enterprise value” to its creditors, but with an option to buy it back (at the exercise \\nprice) when the debt matures. The shares of a levered company thus represent call \\noptions on the capital employed.\\nThe lender, on the other hand, who has invested in the firm at no risk, has sold the \\nshareholders a put option on the capital employed. We have just seen that in the event of \\ndefault, the creditors may find themselves the unwilling owners of the company. Rather \\nthan recouping the amount they lent, they get only the value of the company back. In other \\nwords, they have “bought” the company in exchange for the outstanding amount of debt.\\nThe sale of this (European-style) put option results in additional remuneration for the \\ndebtholder which, together with the risk-free rate, constitutes the total return. This is only \\nfair, since the debtholder runs the risk that the shareholders will exercise their put option; \\nin other words, that the company will not pay back the debt.\\nThe features of the put option are:\\nt Underlying asset = capital employed.\\nt Exercise price = amount of debt redeemable upon maturity (100).\\nt Volatility = volatility of the underlying asset, i.e. the capital employed.\\nt Maturity = maturity of the debt.\\nt Interest rate = risk-free rate corresponding to the maturity of the option.'),\n",

This is the risk \\npremium that arises between any loan and its risk-free equivalent.\\nAll this means is that the debtholder has lent the company 103 at an interest rate equal \\nto the risk-free rate. The company should have received 103, but the value of the loan is \\nonly 100 after discounting the flows at the normal rate of return required in view of the \\ncompany’s risk, rather than the risk-free rate.\\nThe company uses the balance of 3, which represents the price of the credit risk, to \\nbuy a put option on the capital employed. In short, the company receives 100 while the \\nbank pays 100 for a risky claim since it has sold a put option for capital employed that \\nthe company, and therefore the shareholders, will exercise if its value is lower than that \\nof the outstanding date at maturity. By exercising the option, the company, and thus its \\nshareholders, discharges its debt by transferring ownership of the capital employed to the \\ncreditors.\\nLending to a company is a means of investing in its assets at no risk. The lender sells \\nthe shareholders a put option at an exercise price that is equal to the debt to be repaid.\\nIn conclusion, we see that, depending on the situation at the redemption date, one of \\nthe following two will apply:\\ntif VD ,< V the value of the call option is higher than 0, the value of the put option is \\nzero and equity is positive,\\nt if VD > V the value of the call option is zero, the value of the put option is higher than \\n0 and the equity is worthless.\\n2/ AN OPTIONS APPROACH TO FINANCIAL SECURITIES\\nWe have already seen that the additivity rule for equity and debt applies and that there is \\nno connection between enterprise value and the type of financing:\\nEnterprise value = value of equity + value of debt\\nBased on the preceding developments, we deduce that:\\nValue of equity = value of the call option on capital employed\\nValue of debt = present value of debt at the risk-free rate \\n− value of the put option\\nEnterprise value = value of the call option \\n+ present value of debt at the risk-free rate \\n− value of the put option'),\n",

The option’s exercise price is the amount of debt to be \\nrepaid at maturity, the life of the option is that of the debt, and its underlying asset is the \\nfirm’s capital employed.\\nThis means that, at the valuation date, the value of equity is made up of an intrinsic \\nvalue and a time value. The intrinsic value of the call option is the difference between the \\npresent value of capital employed and the debt to be repaid upon maturity. The time value \\ncorresponds to the difference between the total value of equity and the intrinsic value.\\nThe main contribution of options theory to corporate ﬁnance is the concept of a time \\nvalue for equity.\\nTake, for example, a company where the return on capital employed is lower than that \\nrequired by investors in view of the related risk. The market value is thus lower than the \\nbook value.\\nIf the debt were to mature today, the shareholders would exercise their put option \\nsince the capital employed is worth only 70 while the outstanding debt is 80. The com-\\npany would have to file for bankruptcy. Fortunately, the debt is not redeemable today but \\nonly in, say, two years’ time. By then, the enterprise value may have risen to over 80. In \\nthat case, equity will have an intrinsic value equal to the difference between the enterprise \\nvalue at the redemption date and the amount to be redeemed (in our case, 80).\\nToday, however, the intrinsic value is zero and the present value of equity (8) can only \\nbe explained by the time value, which represents the hope that, when the debt matures two \\nyears hence, enterprise value will have risen enough to exceed the amount of debt to be \\nrepaid, giving the equity an intrinsic value.'),\n",

We shall assume that the liabilities of Holding plc comprise 100 \\nshares and 300 bonds. Each of the latter is a zero-coupon bond with a redemption value of £1000 \\nin three years’ time. The creditors do not expect any coupon payments or changes in the capital \\nstructure before the debt redemption date.\\nThe table below lists the closing prices for a call option on a Daughter plc share at \\nvarious exercise prices:\\nExercise price (£) Value of a 3-year call option on Daughter plc (£)\\n2600 130\\n2800 80\\n3000 45\\n3200 31\\nThe enterprise value of Holding plc is equal to the number of Daughter plc shares multi-\\nplied by their closing price, i.e. £223 000.\\nConsider each of the 100 shares booked under liabilities at Holding plc as being an \\noption on its capital employed (the shares of Daughter plc), i.e. £223 000, with an exercise \\nprice that is equal to the amount of Holding plc debt outstanding, giving 300 bonds ×\\n£1000 = £300 000.\\nEach Holding plc share can thus be considered to be a call option with an exercise \\nprice of £300 000/100 shares = £3000, and a maturity of three years.\\nAccording to the table above, Holding plc’s equity value is thus £45 × 100 shares =\\n£4500.\\nOne bond is therefore worth £728.3 (£218 500/300), corresponding to an implied \\nyield of 11.1% (in fact: 728.3 = 1000/(1 + 0.111)3).'),\n",

The \\noverall exercise price corresponding to the redemption value of the debt at maturity is:\\n320 bonds × £1000 = £320 000 or £3200 per share\\nA look at the listed prices of the options shows us that at an exercise price of £3200, Hold-\\ning plc’s equity is valued as £31 ×100 shares = £3100, indicating that the value of its debt \\nat the same date is £219 900 (223 000 − 3100).\\nThe new bondholders will thus pay £13 744 (20 bonds × £219 900/320 bonds), \\nwhich will go to reduce the equity of Holding plc.\\nThe shareholders consequently have £13 744 in cash and £3100 in shares, i.e. a total \\nof £16 844 compared with the previous £4500. They have gained £12 344 to the detriment \\nof the former creditors, who have seen the value of their claim fall from £218 500 to 300 \\nbonds× £687.19 bonds, or £206 156.\\nTheir loss (218 500 − 206 156 = £12 344) exactly mirrors the shareholders’ gain. \\nThe implicit yield to maturity has risen to 13.3%, reflecting the fact that the borrowing \\nhas become riskier since it now finances a larger share of the same amount of capital \\nemployed.\\nIncreasing the risk to creditors has enhanced the value of the shares, thereby \\nreducing that of the bonds.

According to this reasoning, after the buy-back the Holding plc shares should have \\nbeen revalued at −£9244 (£4500 − £13 744), but that cannot be!\\nOptions theory solves this apparent paradox. It shows that when new debt is issued \\nto reduce equity, the time value of the shares decreases less than the amount received by \\nshareholders and remains positive. True, the likelihood that the value of Daughter plc \\nshares will be higher than that of the redeemable debt upon maturity has lessened (since \\ndebt has increased), but it is still not nil, giving a time value that, while lower, is still \\npositive.\\nOf course, this example is exaggerated. Such a decision would have catastrophic \\nconsequences for shareholders who would be taken to court by the creditors and lose \\nall credibility in the eyes of the market. But it effectively illustrates the contribution of \\noptions theory to equity valuations.\\nIncreasing debt increases the value of shareholders’ investment to the detriment of the \\nclaims held by existing creditors. Thus, value is transferred from creditors to shareholders.\\nConversely, when debt is reduced by a capital increase, the overall value of shares \\ndoes not increase by the value of the shares issued. The old debt, which has become less \\nrisky, has, in fact, “confiscated” some of the value to the benefit of creditors and the detri-\\nment of shareholders.\\n2/ THE INVESTMENT DECISION\\nNow let us return to our initial scenario and assume that Holding plc manages to exchange \\nthe 100 shares of Daughter plc for 100 shares of a company with a higher risk profile \\ncalled Risk plc, for £223 000 (100 × £2230).\\nEach share of Holding plc is equal to a call option on a Risk plc share with an exercise \\nprice of £3000 (300 × 1000/100).\\nSuppose the value of a call option on a Risk plc share is £140 with an exercise price \\nof £3000 and an exercise date in three years’ time.\\nThe Holding plc shares are consequently worth £14 000.\\nExchanging a low-risk asset (Daughter plc) for a highly volatile asset (Risk plc) has \\nredistributed value to the benefit of shareholders, whose gain is £9500 (14 000 − 4500).\\nTheir gain is offset by an equivalent loss to creditors, since the value of the debt has \\nfallen from 218 500 to 223 000 − 14 000 = £209 000, i.e. a £9500 decline.\\nThe higher risk led to an increase in the implicit yield to maturity of the bonds from \\n11.1% to 12.8%.\\nAs in our previous examples, the transfer of value was only possible because creditors \\nunderestimated the power shareholders have over the company’s investment decisions.\\n3/ RENEGOTIATING THE TERMS OF DEBT\\nWhat if we now return to our initial situation and imagine that the company is able to \\nreschedule its debt? This happens when creditors prefer to let a company in financial \\ndistress attempt a turnaround rather than precipitate its demise.'),\n",

A bond is therefore worth \\n£725.7 (£217 700/300). Without having abandoned any flows, creditors’ generosity will \\nhave cost them £800.\\n4/ OTHER PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\\nAs our readers may have understood, shareholders’ equity is effectively only valued using \\nthe option models for distressed companies.\\nThese theoretical developments have been the basis for the creation of models to \\nassess the default risk of the firm. In particular, the consulting company KMV has devel-\\noped well-known models from the work of Merton, Black and Scholes. Such models are \\nused in particular by banks in the context of Basel III requirements.\\nHedge funds have developed arbitrage strategies between debt and equity markets \\n(capital structure arbitrage) based on this approach. These techniques use mainly credit \\ndefault swaps (CDS). Lastly, some borrowers hedge their credit risk by selling shares of \\nthe firm short. In doing so, they earn on one side what they may lose on the drop of value \\nof their loan.\\nSection 34.4\\nRESOLVING CONFLICTS BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS AND CREDITORS\\nCreditors have a number of means at their disposal to protect themselves and overcome \\nthe asymmetry from which they suffer. They can be grouped under two main headings:\\nthybrid financial securities;\\nt restrictive covenants.\\n1/ HYBRID FINANCIAL SECURITIES\\nHybrid financial securities, combining features of both debt and equity – such as con-\\nvertible bonds, bonds with equity warrants, participating loan stock, etc. – would not '),\n",

By issuing such hybrid securities, shareholders are, in \\neffect, giving creditors a call option on equity which neutralises the call option on equity \\ncreditors have granted shareholders.\\nIn fact, should shareholders make investment or financing decisions that are \\ndetrimental to creditors, the latter can exercise their warrants or convert their bonds into \\nshares, thus becoming shareholders themselves and, if all goes well, recouping in equity \\nwhat they have lost in debt!\\nJensen and Meckling (1976) have demonstrated that the issue of convertible bonds \\nreduces the risk of the firm’s assets being replaced by more risky assets that increase \\nvolatility and thus the value of the shares. The same reasoning is applied when “free” war-\\nrants are granted to creditors who agree to waive some of their claims during a corporate \\nrestructuring plan (see Chapter 24).\\n2/ RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS\\nCovenants are commitments to do or not do. If the ﬁrm does not meet these covenants, \\ndebt becomes due immediately.\\nCovenants act like an atomic bomb that aim at convincing shareholders not to spoil \\nlenders. Like an atomic bomb it will not be triggered but pushes parties to negotiate. \\nCovenants are analysed in more detail in Chapter 39.\\nSection 34.5\\nANALYSING THE FIRM ’S LIQUIDITY\\nUntil now, we have assumed that if, on maturity of its debt, the value of the firm’s capital \\nemployed is higher than the debt, shareholders will undertake a capital increase in order \\nto enable it to pay off the debt.\\nIn practice, and more frequently, the company pays off part of its debt with its free \\ncash flows and refinances the balance of its debt by taking out a new loan. Most of the \\ntime, the sum of free cash flows is higher than the amount of debt to be repaid, but the \\nflows generally are further off in time than the due date for the debt, and so are insufficient \\nin the short term. The duration (see Chapter 20) of cash flows is generally longer than the \\nduration of debt flows, which rarely exceed six to seven years.\\nThe firm is then exposed to a double risk:\\nt the risk of the interest rate at which it will refinance part of its current debt in \\nthe future;\\nt a liquidity risk since, at the time the firm has to take out a new loan, market condi-\\ntions may not allow it to if there is a major liquidity crisis underway (as was the case \\nin late 2008/early 2009).\\nIt is possible to hedge against these two risks, as we shall see in Chapter 50. Frequently \\nhowever, the liquidity risk is unhedged, either because it is not always possible to hedge \\nagainst it, or because the cost of hedging is seen as prohibitive, or possibly because severe \\nliquidity crises are so rare that it is not deemed necessary to hedge against this risk.'),\n",

On maturity of its debt, \\nthe firm will only be able to make the repayment if it is able to find lenders that are pre-\\npared to lend to it, since its free cash flows will be insufficient to pay off the whole of the \\ndebt. So what it has done is undertaken to take out future debt at an unknown interest rate \\nin order to continue its activity. In normal times, this liability is worth a negligible amount \\nas it is reasonable to expect that a healthy firm will have no problems in refinancing in the \\nfuture. But in the event of a liquidity crisis and for firms with imminent debt repayment \\ndeadlines (a few months or quarters), this ALRG has a very high value. It is equal to the \\nexisting uncertainty as to the possibility of the company being able to find the necessary \\nfinancing.\\nSo we can say:\\nValue of capital employed\\n− Value of net debt\\n− Value of ALRG\\n= Value of equity capital\\nwhich corresponds to:\\nValue and liquidity\\nEnterprise value\\nValue of the\\nrefinancing gap\\nFace value of\\nnet debt\\nMarket Value\\nof debt\\nValue of the put\\noption embedded\\nin debt\\nTime value\\nof equity\\nIntrinsic value\\nof equity\\nEquity value\\nWhen investors start to worry about the ability of the company to refinance in the near \\nfuture, the value of the ALRG increases, pushing down the value of equity. And the phe-\\nnomenon can pick up speed if the current lenders try and hedge their risks by selling short \\nthe firm’s shares, hoping to gain on this short-selling what they will lose as a result of the \\ndecline in the value of their debt.\\nWhen the firm is able to find refinancing for its debt, for example through a share \\nissue, we see in some cases (Lafarge in 2009) an increase in the share price, which contra-\\ndicts what we have seen up to now. On the one hand, the value of the share is negatively \\nimpacted by the transfer of value to the creditors, but on the other, it benefits fully from \\nthe disappearance of the ALRG. And if the latter were worth more than the discount on \\nthe debt, the net impact would be positive and the value of the share would rise.'),\n",

The value of the shares diminishes less than the dividend payout and increases \\nwhen the debt is used for investment purposes.\\nt Similarly, replacing non-risky assets with risky assets does not change enterprise \\nvalue, but it does transfer value from creditors to shareholders.\\nt Lastly, rescheduling debt transfers value from creditors to shareholders, even if the \\ninterest rate remains the same.\\nThis is called the expropriation effect, where some of the value of the claims is conﬁs-\\ncated without any exchange of ﬂows.\\nWe are now quite far away from the simple book leverage effect that seemed to prove \\nthat shareholders could create value by investing funds at a higher rate than the inter-\\nest rate. The relationship between shareholders and lenders is in practice quite different. \\nTheir interest can actually diverge significantly due to a change in the risk profile of the \\nfirm even if there are no cash flow exchanges between them and the enterprise value \\nremains constant.\\nWe hope that our readers will have understood the importance of reasoning in value \\nterms and now have the reflex of assessing any financial decision is terms of return, but \\nalso risk. The use of options may have been overwhelming. We hope so as readers will \\nnow always remember to assess risk transfers in financial decisions.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nIt seems like stating the obvious when we say that the status of the creditor differs radically \\nfrom that of the shareholder. The shareholder stands to gain a potentially unlimited amount \\nand his risk is limited to his investment, while the creditor, who can also lose his invest-\\nment, can only expect a ﬁxed return.\\nThis asymmetry brings options to mind. This chapter showed that there is more than one\\nsimilarity.\\nThe shareholders’ equity of a levered company can be seen as a call option granted by \\ncreditors to shareholders on the company’s operating assets. The strike price is the value \\nof the debt and the maturity is the date on which the debt is payable. When the debt falls \\ndue, if the value of the operating assets is higher than the amount of the debt to be repaid, \\nthe shareholders exercise their call option on the operating assets, and pay the creditors the \\namount of the debt outstanding. If, however, the value of the operating assets is lower than \\nthe amount of the debt to be repaid, the shareholders decline to pay off the debt, and the \\ncreditors appropriate the operating assets.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

The lender sells the shareholders a put option at a strike price that is equal to the \\ndebt to be repaid.\\nUsing this options-based approach we can break down the value of equity into intrinsic \\nvalue and time value. Intrinsic value is the difference between the present value of capital \\nemployed and the debt to be repaid upon maturity. Time value is the hope that when the \\ndebt matures, enterprise value will have risen to exceed the amount of the debt to be repaid.\\nThis leads to a better understanding of the impact of certain decisions on the ﬁnancial situ-\\nation of creditors and shareholders:\\nta dividend payout ﬁnanced by the sale of assets will increase creditors’ risk, reduce the \\nvalue of the debt owed to them, and at the same time increase the value of shareholders’ \\nequity;\\nt investing in high-risk projects (but for which the net value at the required rate of \\nreturn is nil) does not result in an immediate change in enterprise value, but increases \\ncreditors’ risk, reduces the value of debt and increases the value of shareholders’ equity \\nby the same amount;\\nt by ﬁnancing its own investments (or carrying out a capital increase), the company \\nincreases enterprise value by this amount (if the return on the investment is equal to \\nthe required rate of return). Part of this additional value will go to the creditors, whose \\nrisk is reduced, to the detriment of shareholders, as the overall value of their shares will \\nnot rise by the amount of the funds invested or the capital increase.\\nAll ﬁnancial decisions must be examined from an overall point of view, but also in terms of \\nthe creation or destruction of value for the various stakeholders.

Because financial markets are liquid, situations of \\ndisequilibrium do not last. Arbitrage inevitably takes place to erase them. For this reason, \\nit is very difficult to create value by issuing securities at a price higher than their value. In \\ncontrast, industrial markets are much more viscous. Regulatory, technological and other \\nbarriers make arbitrage – building a new plant, launching a rival product, and so on – far \\nslower and harder to implement than on a financial market, where all it takes is a tele-\\nphone call or an online order.\\nIn other words, a company that has made investments at least as profitable as its pro-\\nviders of funds require will never have insurmountable financing problems. If need be, it \\ncan always restructure the liability side of its balance sheet and find new sources of funds. \\nInversely, a company whose assets are not sufficiently profitable will, sooner or later, have \\nfinancing problems, even if it initially obtained financing on very favourable terms. How \\nfast its financial position deteriorates will depend simply on the size of its debt.\\nGood ﬁnancing can never make up for a bad investment.\\nSection 35.1\\nTHE MAJOR CONCEPTS\\n1/ COST OF A SOURCE OF FINANCING\\nSeveral simple ideas can be stated in this context.'),\n",

The cost of all sources of ﬁnancing is given by the risk proﬁle and the required \\nreturn of the investment. Thus, a cement plant in Russia might require a 25% rate of \\nreturn, and this will be the case whether it is ﬁnanced by equity or debt and whether the \\ninvestor is Russian, Swiss or Indonesian.\\nThe required rate of return is basically independent of the method of financing and the \\nnationality of the investor. It depends solely on the risk of the investment itself.\\nThis presents the following consequences:\\nt It is generally not possible to link the financing to the investment.\\nt No “portfolio effect” can reduce this cost.\\nt Only the bearing of systematic risk will be rewarded.\\nIt is therefore shortsighted to choose a source of financing based on what it appears to \\ncost. To do so is to forget that all sources of financing will cost the same, given the risk.\\n2. For the purpose of managing the liability side of the company’s balance sheet, it is \\na great mistake to take the apparent cost of a source of ﬁnancing as its true cost.\\nWe have too often heard it said that the cost of a capital increase was low, because the \\ndividend yield on the shares was low, that internal financing costs nothing, that convert-\\nible bonds can lower a company’s cost of financing, and so on. Statements of this kind \\nconfuse the accounting cost with the true financial cost.\\nA source of financing is a bargain only if, for whatever reason, it brings in more \\nthan its market value. A convertible bond can be a good deal for the issuer not because \\nit carries a low coupon rate, but only if the option embedded in it can fetch more than its \\nmarket value.\\nLet us dwell briefly on the error one commits by confusing apparent cost and true \\nfinancial cost.\\ntThe difference is minor for debt. It may arise from changes in market interest rates \\nor, more rarely, from changes in default risk. In matters of financial organisation, debt \\nhas the merit that its accounting cost is close to its true cost; furthermore, that cost is \\nvisible on the books, since interest payments are an accounting expense.\\nt The error is greater for equity, inasmuch as the dividend yield on the share needs to \\nbe augmented for prospective growth.\\nt The error is extreme for internal financing, where, as we have seen, the apparent cost \\nof reinvested cash flow is nil.\\nt The error is hard to evaluate for all forms of hybrid securities – and this is often the \\nexplanation for their success. But let the reader beware: the fact that such securities \\ncarry low yields does not mean their financial cost is low. As we have shown in the \\nforegoing chapters, an analysis of the hybrid security using both present value and \\noption valuation techniques is needed to identify the true cost of this financing source.\\n3. When it comes to a company’s ﬁnancing policy, the immediate direct consequences of \\nits sources of ﬁnancing cannot be neglected.\\nDebt, by virtue of the liability that it represents for timely payments of interest and princi-\\npal, has a direct consequence on the company’s cash flow. Debt can plunge the company \\ninto the ditch if its runs into difficulties; on the other hand, it can turn out to be a turbo-\\ncharger that enables the company to take off at high speed if it is successful.'),\n",

Its first function is of course to finance part of the \\ninvestment in the business. The more important purpose, though, is to serve as a guarantee \\nto the company’s creditors who finance the other part of the investment. For this reason, \\nthe cost of equity includes a risk premium.\\nWhence the insurance aspect of equity capital (cf. discussion in Chapter 34 of equity \\nas an option): like insurance, equity financing always costs too much until the crisis hap-\\npens, in which case one is happy to have a lot of it. As we will see later, when a crisis does \\ncome, having considerable equity on the balance sheet gives a company time – time to \\nsurvive and restructure when earnings are depressed, to introduce new products, to seize \\nopportunities for external growth, and so on. \\nBy comparison, a company with considerable debt suffers greatly because it has fixed \\nexpenses (interest payments) and fixed maturities (principal repayment) that will drag it \\ndown further.\\nThe amount of equity capital in a business is also an indicator of the level of risk \\nshareholders are willing to run. In a crisis, the companies with the most leverage are the \\nfirst to disappear.\\nIt is true also that financing geared towards equity does not lead management to react \\nquickly when a crisis happens…and can sometimes mean that non-performing firms sur-\\nvive for a long time.\\nSection 35.2\\nHOW TO CHOOSE A CAPITAL STRUCTURE\\nGraham and Harvey (2001) surveyed top executives and finance directors to determine \\nwhat criteria they use in taking a financing decision. According to their study, the tax sav-\\ning on debt was not an essential criterion in the choice of capital structure, nor was fear of \\nsubstantial bankruptcy costs. Rather, concern about downgrading of the company’s credit \\nrating came top of the list. It is reassuring to see that the conclusions of the second Modi-\\ngliani–Miller article (1963) are not prompting companies to focus on tax considerations \\nin deciding whether or not to take on debt.\\nEven if companies say they have a fairly precise target for the level of their debt, more \\nthan half of all finance directors base their choice of financing on preserving flexibility.\\nAlthough some theoreticians and some finance professors emphasise the limitations of \\nEPS dilution as a criterion – it is not automatically synonymous with destruction of value \\n– among practitioners it remains the most important factor in deciding whether or not to \\nundertake a capital increase. This criterion seems to us a bit outmoded, but we will address \\nit nonetheless in a following section.'),\n",

They know that \\nthe choice of financing is a problem to be evaluated over time, not just at a given moment; \\na choice today can reduce the spectrum of possibilities for another choice to be made \\ntomorrow.\\nThus, taking on debt now will reduce borrowing capacity in the future, when a major \\ninvestment – perhaps foreseeable, perhaps not – may be needed. If borrowing capacity \\nis used up, the company will have no choice but to raise fresh equity. From time to time, \\nthough, the primary market in equities is closed because of depressed share prices (or can \\nbe accessed at such high price conditions, as was the case at the end of 2008, that most \\nissuers are discouraged from tapping this market). If this should be the case when the \\ncompany needs funds, it may have to forego the investment.\\nThe equity capital market may not be open for new business during a crisis, when inves-\\ntors prefer to stick with safer debt securities. Debt markets are much less closed for \\nbusiness than is the equity capital market during a crisis.\\nTrue, the markets for high-yield debt securities react as the equity markets do and may at \\ntimes be closed to new issues or, equally, require such high interest rates that they are de \\nfacto closed. \\nRaising money today with a share issue, however, does not preclude another capital \\nincrease at a later time. Moreover, an equity financing today will increase the borrowing \\ncapacity that can be mobilised tomorrow.\\nA sharp increase in debt reduces a company’s ﬁnancial ﬂexibility, whereas a share issue \\nincreases its borrowing capacity.\\nThe desire to retain flexibility prompts the company to carry less debt than the maximum \\nlevel it deems bearable, so that it will at all times be in a position to take advantage of \\nunexpected investment opportunities. Here again, we find the option concept applied to \\ncorporate finance.\\nIn addition, the CFO will have taken pains to negotiate undrawn lines of credit with \\nthe company’s bank; to have in hand all the shareholder authorisations needed to issue \\nnew debt or equity securities; and to have effective corporate communication on financial \\nmatters with rating agencies, financial analysts and investors.'),\n",

A company that \\nhas already issued securities on the bond market and keeps a dialogue going with bond \\ninvestors can come back to this market very quickly if an investment opportunity appears.\\nThe proliferation of financing sources – bilateral or syndicated bank loans, securi-\\ntised receivables, bonds, convertibles, shares, and so on – allows the company to enhance \\nits financial flexibility even further. \\n2/ THE RATING OF THE COMPANY\\nRatings agencies have clearly gained in importance – especially in Europe – due mostly \\nto the transition from an economy based mostly on banking intermediaries to one where \\nthe financial markets are becoming predominant.\\nRatings are becoming one of the main concerns of CFOs. Financial decisions are thus \\nfrequently taken based partly on their rating impact; or, more precisely, decisions having \\na negative rating impact will be adjusted accordingly. Some companies even set rating \\ntargets (Pepsi, Diageo and Vivendi, for example). This can seem paradoxical in two ways:\\ntalthough all financial communication is based on creating shareholder value, compa-\\nnies are much less likely to set share price targets than rating targets;\\nt in setting rating targets, companies have a new objective: that of preserving value for \\nbondholders! This is praiseworthy and, in a financial market context, understandable, \\nbut has never been part of the bargain with shareholders.\\nWe see several possible explanations for this paradox. First of all, a debt rating downgrade \\nis clearly a major event for a group and goes well beyond bondholder information. A \\ndowngrade is traumatic and messy and almost always leads to a fall in the share price. So, \\nin seeking to preserve a financial rating, it is also shareholder value that management is \\nprotecting, at least in the short term.\\nA downgrade can also have an immediate cost if the company has issued a bond with \\na step-up in the coupon, i.e. a clause stating that the coupon will be increased in the event \\nof a rating downgrade. Step-ups are meant to protect lenders against a downgrade and \\nobviously make managers pay more attention to their debt rating.\\nA good debt rating guarantees a higher degree of financial flexibility. The higher the \\nrating, the easier it is to tap the bond markets, as transactions are less dependent on market \\nfluctuations. An investment grade company, for example, can almost always issue bonds, \\nwhereas market windows close regularly for companies that are below investment grade.\\n3/ LIFECYCLE OF THE COMPANY AND THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS\\nOF THE COMPANY ’S SECTOR\\nA start-up will have a hard time getting any debt financing. It has no past and thus no \\ncredit history, and it probably has no tangible assets to pledge as security. The technologi-\\ncal environment around it is probably quite unsettled, and its free cash flow is going to be \\nnegative for some time. For a lender, the level of specific risk is very high. The start-up \\nconsequently has no choice but to seek equity financing.'),\n",

Its credit history \\nis there, its assets are real and it is generating free cash flows (predictable with low fore-\\ncast error) which are all the greater if the major investments have already been made. In \\nshort, it has everything a creditor craves. In contrast, an equity investor will find little to be \\nenthusiastic about: not much growth, not much risk, thus not much profitability.\\nHere we see the lifecycle of ﬁnancing sources. An industrial venture is initially ﬁnanced \\nwith equity. As the company becomes institutionalised and its risk diminishes, debt \\nﬁnancing takes over, freeing up equity capital to be invested in emerging new sectors.\\nSimilarly, in an industry with high fixed costs, a company will seek to finance itself mostly \\nwith equity, so as not to pile the fixed costs of debt (interest payments) on top of its fixed \\noperating costs and to reduce its sensitivity to cyclical downswings. But sectors with high \\nfixed costs – steel, cement, paper, energy, telecoms, etc. – are generally highly capital-\\nintensive and thus require large investments, inevitably implying borrowing as well.\\nAn industry such as retailing with high variable costs, on the other hand, can make \\nthe bet that debt entails, as the fixed costs of borrowing come on top of low fixed operat-\\ning costs.\\nLastly, the nature of the asset can influence the availability of financing to acquire it. A \\nhighly specific asset – that is, one with little value outside of a given production process –  \\nwill be hard to finance with debt. Lenders will fear that if the company goes under, the \\nasset’s market value will not be sufficient to pay off their claims.\\nIn their study Frank and Goyal (2009) put forward six factors that have an impact on \\nthe debt level of a firm. The first factor is the business sector. The others are the proportion \\nof fixed assets, the level of earnings, the size, the Price-to-Book and inflation. They show \\nthat the bigger the company, the higher the debt level.\\nDebt level\\nBank\\ndebt\\nVenture capital\\nPrivate investors\\nInitial\\nPublic\\nOffering\\nFinancial risk (of the financial structure)\\nBusiness risk (of the operating activity)\\nBond issue\\nSyndicated\\nloans\\nEquity issue\\nThe lifecycle of a company and its capital structure\\nLarge dividends\\nShare buy-back\\nExtraordinary dividends\\nLBO'),\n",

A company in this situation must then go deeply \\ninto debt. Others may have a marked aversion to debt because they have no desire to \\nincrease the level of risk they are bearing.\\nThe choice of capital structure is also the choice of a level of risk that shareholders are \\nwilling to incur.\\nThe most ambitious shareholders will accept both dilution of their control and risk linked \\nto a high level of debt. Their control and the survival of the firm will only be possible \\nthanks to the success of the strategy (Pernod Ricard, for example).\\n5/ OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS\\nSince markets are not systematically in equilibrium, opportunities can arise at a given \\nmoment. A steep run-up in share prices will enable a company to undergo a capital \\nincrease on the cheap (by selling shares at a very high price). The folly of a bank that says \\nyes to every loan application and the sudden infatuation of investors for a particular kind \\nof stock (renewable energy companies in 2005–2008, Hong Kong listings in 2010–2011) \\nare other examples.\\nLet the reader not be intoxicated by opportunities. It is hard to base a ﬁnancing policy on \\na succession of opportunities, which are, by deﬁnition, unpredictable. They can happen \\nonly on margin.\\nFurthermore, if the company at some point in time is enjoying exceptionally low-cost \\nfinancing, investors, for their part, will have made a bad mistake. In their fury, they risk \\ntarnishing the company’s image, and it will be a long time before they can be counted \\non to put up new money. The start-up that went public at the peak of the “new economy” \\nboom on the stock market will surely have raised money at low cost, but how will it raise \\nmore capital a year later, after its share price has fallen by 70%?\\n6/ CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF COMPETITORS\\nTo have higher net debt than one’s rivals is to bet heavily on the company’s future prof-\\nitability – that is, on the economy, the strategy, and so forth. It is therefore to be more \\nvulnerable to a cyclical downturn, one that could lead to a shake-out in the sector and \\nextinction of the weakest.\\nExperience shows that business leaders are loath to imperil an industrial strategy \\nby adopting a financing policy substantially different from their competitors’. If they \\nhave to take risks, they want them to be industrial or commercial risks, not financial \\nrisks. '),\n",

The investor will bear in mind that, statistically \\n(and thus, for his diversified portfolio), his dream of multiplying his wealth through judi-\\ncious use of debt will be the nightmare of the company in financial distress.\\nThe financial success of a few tends to make one forget the failure of companies \\nthat did not survive because they were too much in debt.\\n7/ MANAGERS ’ CHARACTER\\nThe character of managers will materially influence the capital structure of the firm. \\nManagers adverse to risk choose a capital structure with low leverage whereas those with \\nhigh self-confidence adopt a highly geared financial structure. Malmendier, Tate and Yan \\n(2011) have shown that managers who experienced the Great Depreciation favour self-\\nfinancing and are very prudent towards raising debt.\\nThis may seem obvious but it reminds us that choices in corporate finance can be \\nhighly subjective, behavioural finance is not to be underestimated. \\nSection 35.3\\nEFFECTS OF THE FINANCING CHOICE ON ACCOUNTING\\nAND FINANCIAL CRITERIA\\nWith this description of the key ideas in mind, the time has come for the reader to imple-\\nment a choice of capital structure as part of a financing plan. To this end, we suggest that \\nthe following documents be at hand:\\n1. past financial statements: income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements;\\n2. forecast financial statements and financing plan, constructed in the same form as \\npast cash flow statements. These can either be mean forecasts or simulations based \\non several assumptions; the latter strikes us as the better solution. A simulation \\nmodel will be very useful for establishing the probable future course of the com-\\npany’s capital structure, profitability, business conditions, and so on, given a set of \\nassumptions. This kind of exercise is facilitated by using spreadsheet software and \\nsimulation assumptions that allow for a dynamic analysis;\\n3. to be fully prepared, the analyst will also want to have sector average ratios, which \\ncan be obtained from various industry studies.\\n1/ IMPACT ON LIQUIDITY\\nThe liquidity of the company is its ability to meet its financial obligations on time in the \\nordinary course of business, obtain new sources of financing and thereby ensure balance \\nat all times between its income and expenditure.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\CoreCourseFinancialAccounting .pdf', 'page': 667}, page_content='CAPITAL STRUCTURE POLICIES652\\nSECTION 4\\nc35.indd 01:28:22:PM  09/05/2014 Page 652Trim Size: 189 X 246 mm\\nIn a truly serious financial crisis, companies can no longer obtain the financing they \\nneed, no matter how good they are. This is the case in a crash brought on by a panic. It \\nis not possible to protect oneself against this risk, which fortunately is altogether excep-\\ntional. The more common liquidity risk occurs when a company is in trouble and can no \\nlonger issue securities that financial markets or banks will accept; investors have no con-\\nfidence in the company at all, regardless of the merit of its investment projects.\\nLiquidity is therefore related to the term structure of financial resources. It is analysed \\nboth at the short-term level and at the level of repayment capacity for medium- and long-\\nterm debt. This leads to the use of traditional concepts and ratios that we have already \\nseen: working capital, equity, debt, current assets/current liabilities, and so on.\\nFor analysing the impact on liquidity, the simulation must bear on free cash flows. \\nThe analyst will need to simulate different levels of debt and repayment terms and test \\nwhether free cash flows are sufficient to pay off the borrowings without having to resched-\\nule them. This is also a method used by rating agencies to determine their rating and by \\nbankers to assess whether they want to lend to a firm or not.\\nIf the company bears a high level of debt, the analyst will consider worst-case \\nscenarios to assess when the liquidity situation will become critical. The analyst will then \\nbe focused on the volatility of free cash flows compared to the central scenario.\\n2/ IMPACT ON SOLVENCY\\nDebt increases the company’s risk of becoming insolvent. We refer the reader to the \\ndevelopment of this topic in Chapter 14.\\n3/ IMPACT ON EARNINGS\\nOther things being equal, debt raises the company’s breakeven point.\\nThis is obvious inasmuch as interest payments constitute a fixed cost that cannot be \\nreduced except by renegotiating the terms of the loan or filing for bankruptcy. Take, as \\nan example, a company with fixed costs of 40 and variable costs of 0.5 per unit sold. If \\nthe selling price is 1, the breakeven point is 80 units. If the company finances an invest-\\nment of 50 with debt at 6%, the breakeven point rises to 86 units because fixed costs have \\nincreased by 3 (interest expense on the borrowing). If the investment is financed with \\nequity, the breakeven point stays at 80.\\nThe problem is trickier when the interest rate is indexed to market rates but the inter-\\nest payments are still a fixed cost in the sense of being independent of the level of activity. \\nTypically, interest rates rise when general economic activity is weakening. In such a case, \\nit is important to test the sensitivity of the company’s earnings to changes in interest rates. \\n4/ IMPACT ON RETURN ON EQUITY\\nFor a company with no debt, the return on equity is equal to the rate of return on capital \\nemployed. For a company with debt, one must add to the former a supplement (sometimes '),\n",

However, a static analysis \\nis not sufficient. What is needed is to determine the sensitivity of return on equity to any \\nchange in financial leverage, cost of debt or return on capital employed.\\n5/ IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE\\nAn investment financed by debt increases the company’s net profit, and thus earnings per \\nshare, only if the after-tax return generated by its investments is greater than the after-tax \\ncost of debt. If this is not the case, the company should not make the investment. If an \\ninvestment is particularly sizeable and long-term, it may happen that its rate of return is \\nless than the cost of debt for a period of time, but this must be a temporary situation.\\nTo study these phenomena, companies are accustomed to analysing changes in earn-\\nings per share relative to operating profit (EBIT).\\nExampleConsider the example of a company which makes an investment of 200 in \\nperiod 0 that will become fully operational in period 2. This investment is financed by a \\ncall to shareholders (case A) or by borrowing (case B). A simulation of the main param-\\neters of profitability gives the results shown in the table below.\\nPeriod 0 Period 1 Period 2\\nCase A Case B Case A Case B\\nOperating proﬁt (EBIT) 300 300 300 370 370\\n− Interest expense at 6% 0 0 12 0 12\\n= Pre-tax proﬁt 300 300 288 370 358\\n− Income tax at 35% 105 105 101 130 125\\n= Net proﬁt 195 195 187 242 233\\nNumber of shares 100 120 100 120 100\\nEarnings per share 1.95 1.62 1.87 1.85 2.33\\nIn period 2, earnings per share will be greater if the investment is financed by debt. In \\ncase B, the interest expense reduces EPS, but by less than the dilution due to the capital \\nincrease in case A.\\nThis conclusion cannot be generalised, however. The following chart simulates vari-\\nous levels of EPS as a function of operating profit in period 2.\\nIn short: beware! The faster growth of EPS with debt financing is a purely arithme-\\ntic result; it does not indicate greater value creation. It is due simply to the leverage effect, \\nthe counterpart of which is a higher level of risk to the shareholder.\\nAn investment ﬁnanced by debt increases EPS in year N if the company’s marginal return \\non capital employed in year N is greater than the after-tax cost of debt.\\nAn investment ﬁnanced by equity in year N increases EPS in year N + 1 if the company’s \\nmarginal return on capital employed in year N + 1 is greater than the reciprocal of P/E \\nin year N.'),\n",

Apparent cost must not be confused with ﬁnan-\\ncial cost (the true economic cost of a source of ﬁnancing). The difference between apparent \\ncost and ﬁnancial cost is low for debt; it is attributable to the possibility of changes in the \\ndebt ratio and default risk. The difference is greater for equity owing to growth prospects; \\ngreater still for internal ﬁnancing, where the explicit cost is nil; and difﬁcult to evaluate for \\nall hybrid securities. Lastly, a source of ﬁnancing is cheap only if, for whatever reason, it has \\nbrought in more than its market value.\\nBecause there is no optimal capital structure, the choice between debt and equity will \\ndepend on a number of considerations:\\n t Macroeconomic conditions. High real (inﬂation-adjusted) interest rates and low activity \\ngrowth will prompt companies to deleverage. Inversely, rapid growth and/or low real \\ninterest rates will favour borrowing.\\n t The desire to retain a degree of ﬁnancial ﬂexibility so that any investment opportunities \\ncan be quickly seized. To this end, equity ﬁnancing is preferred because it creates \\nadditional borrowing capacity and does not compromise future choices. Inversely, if \\ncurrent borrowing capacity is used up, the only source of ﬁnancing left is equity; its \\navailability depends on share prices holding up, which is never assured.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

In this con-\\ntext, it is very likely that shareholders will value it at less than a cent given the low return \\nprovided. After all, shareholders do not need the firm to place cash at the bank. All in all, \\nfailure to comply with this rule will most likely lead to value destruction.\\nAdditionally, the business risk should be financed through equity; otherwise, the firm \\nis likely to face strong liquidity issues at the first downturn. Conversely, a company that \\nhas reached economic maturity with a strong strategic position may reduce its equity \\nfinancing and select a higher gearing. The business cash flows have become sufficiently \\nsound to support the cash requirements of debt.\\nEquity exists to support the business risk; therefore it is normal that once this risk is \\nmanaged, debt takes over in the ﬁnancing of the ﬁrm. The dividend policy is one of the \\nmain tools for achieving this objective but it can have other effects, as we will see.\\nSection 36.1\\nREINVESTED CASH FLOW AND THE VALUE OF EQUITY\\n1/ PRINCIPLES\\nAn often-heard precept in finance says that a company ought to fund its development \\nsolely through internal financing – that is, by reinvesting its cash flow in the business. This '),\n",

In \\nvirtually all of the world’s tax systems, capital gains are taxed less heavily than divi-\\ndends. Other things being equal, shareholders will prefer to receive their returns in \\nthe form of capital gains. They will therefore look favourably on retention rather than \\ndistribution of periodic cash flows.\\nt By funding its development exclusively from internal sources, the company has no \\nneed to go to the capital markets – that is, to investors in shares or corporate bonds – \\nor to banks. For this reason, its managers will have greater freedom of action. They, \\ntoo, will look favourably on internal financing.\\nt Lastly, as we have seen, the company’s creditors will prefer that it rely on internal \\nfinancing because this will reduce the risk and increase the value of their claims on \\nthe company.\\nThis precept is not wrong, but here we must emphasise the dangers of taking it to excess. \\nA policy of always or only reinvesting internally generated cash flow postpones the finan-\\ncial reckoning that is indispensable to any policy. It is not good for a company to be cut \\noff from the capital markets or for capital mobility to be artificially reduced, allowing \\ninvestments to be made in unprofitable sectors. The company that follows such a policy in \\neffect creates its own internal capital market independent of the outside financial markets. \\nOn that artificial market, rates of return may well be lower, and resources may accord-\\ningly be misallocated.\\nThe sounder principle of finance is probably the one that calls for distributing all \\nperiodic earnings to shareholders and then going back to them to request funding for \\nmajor projects. In the real world, however, this rule runs up against practical consider-\\nations – substantial tax and transaction costs and shareholder control issues – that make \\nit difficult to apply.\\nIn short, internal ﬁnancing enjoys an extraordinarily positive image among those who \\nown, manage or lend to the company. However, although internally generated cash \\nﬂow belongs fundamentally to the shareholders, they have very little control over it. \\nThe result is that a policy of reinvesting cash ﬂow can prove to be a time bomb for the \\ncompany.\\n2/ INTERNAL FINANCING AND VALUE CREATION\\nWe begin by revisiting a few truisms.\\ntThe reader should fully appreciate that, given unchanged market conditions, the value \\nof the company must increase by the amount of profit that it reinvests. This much \\noccurs almost automatically, one might say. The performance of a strategy that seeks \\nto create “shareholder value” is measured by the extent to which it increases the \\nvalue of shareholders’ equity by more than the amount of reinvested earnings.\\nt The apparent cost of internal financing is nil.  This is certainly true in the short \\nterm, but what a trap it is in the long term to think this way! Does the reader know '),\n",

Reinvested cash flow indeed has a \\ncost and, as we have learned from the theory of markets in equilibrium, that cost \\nhas a direct impact on the value of the company. It is an opportunity cost.  Such \\na cost is, by nature, not directly observable – unlike the cost of debt, which is \\nmanifested in an immediate cash outflow. As we explained previously, retaining \\nearnings rather than distributing them as dividends is financially equivalent to \\npaying out all earnings and simultaneously raising new equity capital. The cost \\nof internal financing is therefore the same as the cost of a capital increase: to \\nwit, the cost of equity.\\nt Does this mean the company ought to require a rate of return equal to the cost of \\nequity on the investments that it finances internally? No. As we saw in Chapter 29, it \\nis a mistake to link the cost of any source of financing to the required rate of return \\non the investment that is being financed. Whatever the source or method of financ-\\ning, the investment must earn at least the cost of capital.1 By reinvesting earnings \\nrather than borrowing, the company can reduce the proportion of debt in its capital \\nstructure and thereby lower its cost of debt. In equilibrium, this cost saving is added \\non top of the return yielded by the investment, to produce the return required by \\nshareholders. Similarly, an investment financed by new debt needs to earn not the \\ncost of debt, but the cost of capital, which is greater than the cost of debt. The excess \\ngoes to increase the return to the shareholders, who bear additional risk attributable \\nto the new debt.\\nt Retained earnings add to the company’s financial resources,  but they increase \\nshareholder wealth only if the rate of return on new investments is greater than the \\nweighted average cost of capital. If the rate of return is lower, each euro invested in \\nthe business will increase the value of the company by less than one euro, and share-\\nholders will be worse off than if all the earnings had been distributed to them. This is \\nthe market’s sanction for poor use of internal financing.\\nConsider the following company. The market value of its equity is 135, and its sharehold-\\ners require a rate of return of 7.5%.\\nYear Book value \\nof equity\\nNet proﬁt Dividend (Div) Market value \\nof equity (V) \\nP/E = 9\\nGain in \\nmarket \\nvalue (ΔV)\\nRate of return \\n(ΔV + Div)\\n/V\\n1 300.0 15.0 4.5 135.0\\n2 310.5 15.6 4.7 140.4 5.4 7.2%\\n3 321.4 16.2 4.9 145.8 5.4 7.1%\\n4 332.7 16.8 6.7 151.2 5.4 8.0%\\nAnnual returns on equity are close to 7.5%. Seemingly, shareholders are getting what they \\nwant. But are they?\\nTo measure the harm done by ill-advised reinvestment of earnings, one need only \\ncompare the change in the book value of equity over four years (+32.7) with the change \\nin market value ( +16.2). For each €1 the shareholders reinvested in the company, they \\ncan hope to get back only €0.50.

When the return on reinvested cash ﬂow is equal to the cost \\nof capital, this machine has an energy yield of 1. Its energy yield falls below 1 whenever \\nthe return on incremental investment is below the required return. When that happens, \\nthere is a loss of energy; in other words, value is destroyed, not created.\\nBeware of “cathedrals built of steel and concrete” – companies that have reinvested to an \\nextent not warranted by their profitability!\\nReinvesting earnings automatically causes the book value of equity to grow. It does \\nnot cause symmetrical growth in the market value of the company unless the investments \\nit finances are sufficiently profitable – that is, unless those investments earn more than \\nthe required rate of return given their risk. If they earn less, shareholders’ equity will \\nincrease but shareholders’ wealth will increase less than the amount of the reinvested \\nfunds. Shareholders would be better off if the funds that were reinvested had instead been \\ndistributed to them.\\nIn our example, the market value of equity (151) is only about 45% of its book value \\n(333). True, the rate of return on equity (5%) is, in this case, far below the cost of equity \\n(7.5%).\\nMore than a few unlisted mid-sized companies have engaged in excessive reinvest-\\nment of earnings in unprofitable endeavours, with no immediate visible consequence on \\nthe valuation of the business.\\nThe owner-managers of such companies get a painful wake-up call when they find \\nthey can sell the business, which they may have spent their entire working lives building, \\nonly for less than the book value (restated or not) of the company’s assets. The sanction \\nimposed by the market is severe.\\nOnly investment at least at the cost of capital can maintain the value of reinvested cash \\nﬂow. This assumes that investments undertaken (assuming similar level of risk) yield at \\nleast the cost of capital of the ﬁrm.\\n3/ INTERNAL FINANCING AND TAXATION\\nFrom a tax standpoint, reinvestment of earnings has long been considered a panacea for \\nshareholders. It ought to translate into an increase in the value of their shares and thus \\ninto capital gains when they liquidate their holdings. Generally, capital gains are taxed \\nless heavily than dividends.\\nOther things being equal, then, shareholders will prefer to receive their income in the \\nform of capital gains and will favour reinvestment of earnings. Since the 1990s, however, \\nas shareholders have become more of a force and taxes on dividends have been reduced in \\nmost European countries, this form of remuneration has become less attractive.\\n4/ INTERNAL FINANCING , SHAREHOLDERS AND LENDERS\\nWe have seen (cf. the discussion of options theory in Chapter 34) that whenever a com-\\npany becomes more risky, there is a transfer of value from creditors to shareholders. \\nSymmetrically, whenever a company pays down debt and moves into a lower risk class, \\nshareholders lose and creditors gain.'),\n",

This capital increase tends to diminish the risk borne by \\ncreditors and thus, in theory, makes them better off by increasing the value of their claims \\non the company.\\nThe same reasoning applies in reverse to dividend distribution. The more a company \\npays out in dividends, the greater the transfer of value from creditors to shareholders. \\nThis is to be expected, since a high dividend policy is the inverse of a high earnings \\nretention policy.\\n5/ INTERNAL  FINANCING , SHAREHOLDERS  AND  MANAGERS\\nAs we will see in Section 36.3 under the agency theory approach, internal financing rep-\\nresents a major issue in the relationship between shareholders and managers. Internal \\nfinancing represents a blank cheque for managers without any control by shareholders. \\nInternal financing is therefore one of the main sources of conflict between managers and \\nshareholders.\\nSection 36.2\\nINTERNAL  FINANCING  AND  FINANCIAL  CRITERIA\\n1/ INTERNAL  FINANCING  AND  ORGANIC  GROWTH\\nGrowth of the equity of a firm that does not issue shares depends on its return on equity \\nand its payout ratio.\\nYear Book value of equity \\nat beginning of year\\nNet proﬁt (15% \\nof equity)\\nRetained \\nearnings\\nBook value of equity \\nat end of year\\n1 100.0 15.0 10.0 110.0\\n2 110.0 16.5 11.0 121.0\\n3 121.0 18.2 12.1 133.1\\n4 133.1 20.0 13.3 146.4\\nThe book value of a company that raises no new money from its shareholders depends on \\nits rate of return on equity and its dividend payout ratio.\\nThe growth rate of book value is equal to the product of the rate of return on equity \\nand the earnings retention ratio, which is the complement of the payout ratio.\\nWe have:\\ngd=× −ROE 1 ()\\nwhere g is the rate of growth of shareholders’ equity,2 ROE (return on equity) is the rate \\nof return on the book value of equity and d is the dividend payout ratio.\\nThis is merely to state the obvious, as the reader should be well aware.\\nIn other words, given the company’s rate of return on equity, its reinvestment \\npolicy determines the growth rate of the book value of its equity.\\n2 Note that in \\nthis section, since \\nno new shares \\nare issued, the \\ngrowth rate of \\nbook value per \\nshare is always \\nequal to the \\ngrowth rate of \\nbook value.\\nA company with \\nbook value of \\nequity of 100 and \\nreturn on equity \\nof 15% will make \\na proﬁt of 15.

We should make it clear that here we \\nare talking about book values, not market values. In effect, the model assumes that there \\nis a direct and systematic relation between the accounting value of shareholders’ equity \\nand the market value thereof; that is, the price-to-book ratio is constant.\\nAt a constant capital structure, the growth in book equity determines the growth in \\ncapital employed.\\nThe preceding model can be generalised to companies with debt as well as equity capital. \\nTo do so, we need only recall that the rate of return on book value of equity is equal to the \\nrate of return on capital employed adjusted for the positive or negative effect of financial \\nleverage (gearing) due to the presence of debt.\\nROE ROCE ROCE=+ − × / () iD E\\nor:\\ngi D\\nE d= ()\\n⎡\\n⎣\\n⎢⎢\\n⎤\\n⎦\\n⎥⎥ ()ROCE ROCE+− × × − 1\\nwhere g is the growth rate of the company’s capital employed at constant capital structure \\nand constant rate of return on capital employed (ROCE).\\nThis is the internal growth model.\\nIt is clear that the rates of growth of revenue, production, EBITDA and so on will be \\nequal to the rate of growth of book equity if the following ratios stay constant:\\nRe , Pr ,venue\\nCapital employed\\noduction\\nCapital employed\\nEBITDA\\nCapiital employed\\nThrough the internal growth model, we establish a direct link between the rate of growth \\nof the business and the rate of growth of capital employed.\\nTo illustrate this important principle, we consider a company whose assets are financed \\n50% by equity and 50% by debt, the latter at an after-tax cost of 5%.

These are very strong assumptions.\\nSuppose a company reinvests two-thirds of its earnings in projects that yield no return \\nat all.

Consider \\na company, Equilibrium plc, with share capital of €100 on which shareholders require \\na 10% return. Since we are in equilibrium, the company is making a net profit of €10. \\nEither these earnings are paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, or they are \\nreinvested in the business at Equilibrium plc’s 10% rate of return.

This harks back to the Modigliani–Miller approach \\nto financial policy: there is no way to create lasting value with merely a financing decision.\\nIn any case, it’s a fallacy to present dividend distribution as remuneration for \\n shareholders, similar to salaries for the company’s employees. The wealth of the employee \\nincreases with the salary. Conversely, the wealth of shareholders is not modified by the \\ndividends they receive: while they are certainly happy about getting this periodical remu-\\nneration, on the other hand, they must consider that the value of their shares will fall by \\nan equivalent amount.\\nDividends do not enrich shareholders. They simply modify their wealth composition, like \\na transfer from the left to the right pocket.\\nWhat about firms that have never paid a dividend like UC RUSAL (the Russian aluminium \\ngroup) or Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffet’s firm)? Have they never remunerated their \\nshareholders? Of course they have and those firms have been very good investments for \\ntheir shareholders. The return for shareholders comes from the increase in value of their '),\n",

The dividend is taken into account not because it \\nrepresents a return for the shareholder but solely to compensate the drop in value of the \\nshare following the dividend payment.\\n2/ DIVIDENDS AS SIGNALS\\nEquilibrium market theory has a hard time finding any good reason for dividends to be \\npaid at all. Since they do exist in the real world, new explanations must be sought for the \\nearnings distribution problem.\\nA justification for the existence of dividends is proposed by the theory of signalling, \\naround which an entire literature has developed, mainly during the 1980s.\\nThe dividend is a means of communication between the company and the market.\\nThe financial information that investors get from companies may be biased by selective \\ndisclosure or even manipulative accounting. Managers are naturally inclined to present the \\ncompany in the best possible light, even if the image they convey does not represent the \\nexact truth. Companies that really are profitable will therefore seek to distinguish themselves \\nfrom those that are not through policies that the latter cannot imitate because they lack the \\nresources to do so. Paying dividends is one such policy because it requires the company to \\nhave cash. A company that is struggling is not able to imitate a company that is prospering.\\nFor this reason, dividend policy is a means of signalling that cannot be faked, and man-\\nagers use it to convince the market that the picture of the company they present is the true one.\\nDividend policy is also a way for the company’s managers to show the market that \\nthey have a plan for the future and are anticipating certain results. If a company maintains \\nits dividend when its earnings have decreased, that signals to the market that the decline \\nis only temporary and earnings growth will resume.\\nDividends are paid a few months after the close of the year, therefore the level of the \\ndividend depends on earnings during both the past and the current period. That level thus \\nprovides information – a signal – about expected earnings during the current period.\\nA dividend reduction, though, is not necessarily bad news for future earnings. It might \\nalso indicate that the company has a new opportunity and needs to invest.\\n3/ DIVIDENDS AND AGENCY THEORY\\nCreditors and managers are seen as having a common interest in favouring reinvestment \\nof earnings. When profits are not distributed, “the money stays in the business”, whereas \\nshareholders “always want more”.\\nIf the manager directs free cash flow into unprofitable investments, his ego may be \\ngratified by the size of the investment budget, or his position may become more secure if \\nthose investments carry low risk.\\nIn addition, retained earnings are one source of financing about which not much dis-\\nclosure is necessary. The cost of any informational asymmetry having to do with internal \\nfinancing is therefore very low. It is not surprising that, as predicted by Jensen (1986) and \\nobserved in a study conducted by Harford (1999), companies that have cash available \\nmake less profitable investments than other companies. Money seems to burn a hole in \\nmanagers’ pockets.'),\n",

If it lasts, the decline will expose the com-\\npany to the risk of a takeover. Assuming the managers themselves do not hold enough of \\nthe company’s shares to ensure that the tender offer succeeds or fails, a change of man-\\nagement may enable the company to get back on track by once again making investments \\nthat earn more than the cost of capital, and thereby lead to a rise in the share price.\\nA formalisation of agency theory as applied to tender offers has been made by \\nMichael Jensen (1986). The key to Jensen’s approach is the notion of free cash flow.\\nJensen defines the difference between the acquisition price and the new market value \\nof the company as the value of the supervision provided by outside firms.\\nHowever, since Jensen’s work was published, managers have been apparently much \\nmore careful when using their cash reserves. They now seem to be aware of the take-\\nover threat which has stricken several ill-managed companies since 1980 (ITT and ABN \\nAMRO, for example). Developing corporate governance principles3 and share buy-back \\npolicies4 are probably linked to this threat.\\nBy requiring managers to pay out a fraction of the company’s earnings to shareholders, \\ndividend policy is a means of imposing “discipline” on those managers and forcing them \\nto include in their reckoning the interest of the company’s owners. A generous dividend \\npolicy will increase the company’s dependence on either shareholders or lenders to finance \\nthe business.\\nIn either case, those putting up the money have the power to say no. In the extreme, \\nshareholders could demand that all earnings be paid out in dividends in order to reduce \\nmanagers’ latitude to act in ways that are not in the shareholders’ interest. The com-\\npany would then have to have regular rights issues, to which shareholders would decide \\nwhether to subscribe based on the profitability of the projects proposed to them by the \\nmanagers. This is the virtuous cycle of finance.\\nAlthough attractive intellectually because it greatly reduces the problem of asym-\\nmetric information, this solution runs up against the high costs of carrying out a capital \\nincrease – not just the direct costs, but the cost in terms of management time as well.\\nBear in mind also that creditors watch out for their interests and tend to oppose overly \\ngenerous dividends that could increase their risk, as we saw in Chapter 34.\\nEven though the dividend is often quite small in relation to the value of equity capital (a \\nfew percent at most), it plays an important role. It is a signal from the company to the \\nﬁnancial markets. It is an instrument for control of managers by the market, in that it \\ndeprives the company of some of the cash the managers would have been able to invest \\nas they saw ﬁt. If the managers still wish to invest that much cash, they will have to \\nborrow; and because debt imposes a discipline of its own (repayment), this pushes them \\nto be more efﬁcient.\\n4/ BECAUSE SHAREHOLDERS WISH IT\\nBaker and Wurgler (2004) have demonstrated that in some periods shareholders demand \\ndividends and are thus ready to pay higher prices for more generous shares. Since 2002 \\nwe have been exactly in this situation. Whilst our readers know that dividends do not \\nenrich shareholders (since the value of the shares falls correspondingly), shareholders \\n3 See \\nChapter\\xa043.\\n4See \\nChapter\\xa037.\\xa0'),\n",

A good example of this atti-\\ntude was provided by John Rockefeller in the 1920s: “Do you know the only thing that I \\nlike? To cash in my dividends!”\\nConversely, there are some periods when investors prefer companies that retain most \\nof their earnings. In these cases, the stock market penalises generous shares, as happened \\nin the second half of the 1990s: at the end of 1998, Telefónica announced the suppression \\nof its dividend for financing its expansion in Latin America. At the announcement, the \\nstock increased by 9%.\\nThe reader may wonder why a series of opposite phases are often observed. We \\nbelieve that there is no better answer than the existence of fads, even in finance. Waves of \\noptimism lead to the reinvestment of earnings; conversely, pessimism pushes companies \\nto distribute a higher portion of earnings.\\n5/ TO PROVIDE SHAREHOLDERS WITH CASH\\nThis is particularly true for private companies, but can also apply to small listed compa-\\nnies with low liquidity on the market. Shareholders are human beings after all; they have \\nneeds and may need cash for day-to-day life.\\nFamily-owned companies may need to pay a regular dividend to allow their share-\\nholders to pay their annual taxes without having to sell part of their holding.\\n6/ TO MODIFY THE FIRM ’S SHAREHOLDER BASE\\nIn most cases, giving back cash to shareholders means giving back the same amount on \\neach share. If this is not the case (i.e. through share buy-backs), the shareholder base of \\nthe company will be modified. As we will see in the next chapter, the control of the firm \\ncan be reinforced by key shareholders not participating in share buy-backs. Shareholders \\nreceiving cash will then be diluted.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nInternal ﬁnancing by reinvestment of cash ﬂow enjoys an excellent image: it reduces risk \\nfor the creditor and results in capital gains rather than more heavily taxed dividends for the \\nshareholder. For managers, it is a resource they can mobilise without having to go to third \\nparties; as such, it reduces the company’s risk and increases the value of their stock options.\\nFor the same reason, though, systematic reinvestment of cash ﬂow can be dangerous. It is \\nnot appealing from a ﬁnancial standpoint if it allows the company to ﬁnance investments \\nthat bring in less than the rate of return required given their risk. To do so is to destroy value. \\nIf the penalty for value destruction is delayed, as it often is because companies that reinvest \\nexcessively are cut off from the capital markets, the eventual sanction is all the harsher.\\nThe trap for the unwitting is that internal ﬁnancing has no explicit cost, whereas its true \\ncost – which is an opportunity cost – is quite real.\\nReinvesting cash ﬂow makes organic growth possible at a rate equal to the rate of return on \\nequity multiplied by the earnings retention ratio (1 minus the payout ratio).

For exam-\\nple, it is absurd to take the ratio of the dividend to the par value of the share, since par \\nvalue often has little to do with equity value.\\nHence the difﬁculty for a company of meeting a dividend yield objective.

To avoid a cut in dividend per share, managers allowed the payout ratio to rise tem-\\nporarily. Conversely, in 2005–2007, years of very good profits, payout ratios were low.\\nSome degree of regularity is desirable, either in earnings growth or in dividends paid out, \\nso the company must necessarily choose an objective for the profile of dividends over \\ntime. Dividend profiles typically fit one of the following three descriptions:\\n t If earnings growth is regular, dividend policy is of lesser importance and the com-\\npany can cut its payout ratio without risk.\\n t If earnings are cyclical owing to the nature of the business sector, it is important \\nfor the dividend to be kept steady. The company needs to retain enough room to \\nmanoeuvre to ensure that phases of steady dividends are followed by phases of rising \\ndividends.\\n t Lastly, a dividend that varies frequently conveys no useful information to the inves-\\ntor and may even suggest that the company’s management has no coherent strategy \\nfor doing business in its sector. A profile of this kind can hardly have any beneficial \\neffect on the share price.\\nA dividend policy must be credible – that is, consistent with the earnings that the com-\\npany achieves. In the long term, no dividend proﬁle, regardless of how smooth it is, can \\nhave favourable effects unless it appears sustainable. In other words, it must not be \\ninconsistent or incompatible with the earnings proﬁle.\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\n35%\\n40%\\n45%\\n50%\\n55%\\n60%\\n1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\\nPayout ratio in Europe and in the USA\\nPayout ratio in Europe Payout ratio in the USA\\nSource: Datastream, Exane BNP Paribas'),\n",

The security with the highest duration \\nwill also have the highest volatility. A high payout ratio tends to reduce duration and \\nthereby makes the share price less volatile.\\nOf course, the payout ratio is not the only determinant of a share’s volatility. For a com-\\npany, paying out little or none of its earnings translates into growth in book value, an \\nincrease in market value and thus eventually into capital gains. To realise those gains, \\nthough, the shareholder has to sell. If selling the company’s shares is a “crime” – and some \\nmanagers come close to regarding it as one – then a low-dividend policy is an inducement \\nto crime. A family-owned company that pays low dividends risks weakening its control.\\nA high-dividend policy, on the other hand, is certainly one way of retaining the loy-\\nalty of shareholders that have got used to the income and have forgotten about the value. \\nThis tends to be particularly true of family shareholders without management roles in the \\ncompany.\\n2/ HOW DIVIDENDS ARE PAID\\n(a) Interim dividend\\nThis practice consists in paying a fraction of the forthcoming dividend in advance. The \\ndecision is taken by the board of directors or the executive board and need not be approved \\nby the AGM. A dividend offers a way of smoothing cash inflows to shareholders and cash \\noutflows from the company. The interim dividend is typically paid in December or Janu-\\nary (midway between two annual dividend dates) and represents between a quarter and a \\nhalf of the annual dividend. In the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, quar-\\nterly or semi-annual dividends are common.\\n(b)Dividend paid in shares\\nCompanies may offer shareholders a choice of receiving dividends in cash or in shares \\nof the company.1 The decision is taken by shareholders at the ordinary general meeting \\nat which the accounts of the year are approved. However, the company’s by-laws must \\nspecifically allow such a choice.\\nPaying the dividend in shares allows the company to make a distribution of earnings \\nwhile retaining the corresponding cash funds.\\nThere is generally no tax advantage for shares issued in payment of dividends. The \\nvalue of the shares received is taxed as if it were paid in cash. A shareholder who chooses \\nto be paid in the form of shares must therefore pay tax on the dividend without having \\nreceived any cash, which may present a problem.\\nOffering to pay dividends in shares may lead to some limited redistribution of owner-\\nship among the shareholders, since some will accept and others will decline.\\nA share dividend represents no special financial advantage for shareholders other \\nthan the ability to reinvest dividends at no charge and generally at a slight discount to the \\nmarket price (at most 10%). Some investors have no compunctions about taking payment \\nof their dividends in shares and immediately selling those shares in order to pocket the \\ndiscount. Manipulation of this kind drives down the price. For this reason, the practice, \\nalthough quite popular in the early 1990s, had practically disappeared.2 It returned in \\n2008 with the economic crisis as firms tried to lower their cash out and strengthen their \\nequity while avoiding cutting dividends.\\n1 If its by-laws \\nallow, a company \\nmay distribute \\nshares that it \\nholds in its port-\\nfolio in place of \\na cash dividend. \\nThis is not the \\nsame as paying \\nthe dividend in \\nits own shares.\\n2The prac-\\ntice made a \\ncomeback in \\n2008 as several \\nbanks wanted to \\npreserve their \\ncash reserves \\namid the sub-\\nprime crisis and \\nthereafter wanted \\nto increase their \\nsolvency given \\nnew banking \\nregulations \\n(Basel III).'),\n",

A preferential dividend can be established only \\nby decision of an extraordinary general meeting when authorised by local laws.\\nLastly, we should mention once again preference shares, which have a higher divi-\\ndend than ordinary shares.\\nSection 37.2\\nEXCEPTIONAL DIVIDENDS , SHARE BUY -BACKS\\nAND CAPITAL REDUCTION\\nA company may, in certain circumstances, buy back its own shares and either keep them \\non the balance sheet or cancel them, in which case there is said to be a capital decrease\\nor capital reduction. Even when shares are repurchased but not cancelled, analysts will \\n(in their own calculations) reduce the number of shares in circulation by the quantity of \\nshares bought back.\\nNeglecting taxes, if one supposes that the company buys back shares from all share-\\nholders in proportion to their holdings and then cancels those shares, the resulting share \\nbuy-back is strictly identical to the payment of a dividend. Cash is transferred from the \\ncompany to the shareholders with no change in the structure of ownership. As we shall \\nsee below, however, an actual capital reduction most often does not even involve all \\nshareholders. \\n1/ SPECIAL DIVIDEND\\nThe special dividend (or exceptional dividend) is a dividend of an exceptionally high \\namount compared to the ordinary dividend. It is obviously not paid on a regular basis \\nand usually corresponds to an exceptional event within the business life of the company \\n(disposal of a large subsidiary, end of a lawsuit, etc.). The €9 dividend from Lagardère \\nthat we mentioned in the previous chapter was an exceptional dividend.\\n2/ SHARE BUY -BACKS\\nOnly listed firms can buy their own shares back on the market. Depending on the country, \\nthe buy-backs have to be authorised by shareholders and may be limited in volume (for \\nexample, a maximum of 10% of the shares every year or 18 months) and in price (a maxi-\\nmum share buy-back price is set). Generally, the shares bought back will be cancelled but \\nthey can also be kept by the company (as treasury stocks) to be handed over in the case of \\nan acquisition, for the exercise of stock options or for the conversion of convertible bonds. \\nTreasury shares lose their voting right and their right to a dividend. They can also be used \\nto enhance liquidity through a liquidity program implemented by a broker.\\nFurthermore, share buy-backs can be used to ease the exit of a large minority share-\\nholder. In this way, Airbus Group allocated part of its share buy-back program in 2013 to \\nLagardère.'),\n",

In practice, the board of directors, using an authorisation that must \\nhave been granted to it at an extraordinary general meeting, makes an offer to all \\nshareholders to buy all or part of their shares at a certain price during a certain period \\n(usually about one month). If too many shares are tendered under the offer, the com-\\npany scales back all the surrender requests in proportion. If too few are tendered, \\nit cancels the shares that are tendered. If management decides on a tender offer, it \\nhas the option of considering the traditional fixed-price offering or the Dutch auc-\\ntion method. In Dutch auctions, the firm no longer offers to repurchase shares at a \\nsingle price, but rather announces a range of prices. Each shareholder thus must \\nspecify an acceptable selling price within the prescribed range set by the company. \\nIf he chooses a high selling price, he will increase his proceeds provided that the \\nshares are accepted by the company, but he reduces the probability that shares will be \\naccepted for repurchase. At the end of the offer period, the firm tabulates the received \\noffers, and determines the lowest price that allows repurchasing the desired number \\nof shares.\\nt In some countries, a share buy-back can be accomplished by issuing put warrants\\nto each shareholder, each warrant giving the holder the right to sell one share to the \\ncompany at a specified price. Such a warrant is a put option issued by the company.\\nA capital decrease changes the capital structure and thereby increases the risk borne by \\ncreditors. To protect the latter, the law generally allows creditors to require additional \\nguarantees or call their loans early, although they cannot block the operation outright.\\n4/ THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY AND ITS RATIOS\\nConsider a company with book value of equity of €400m, one million shares outstanding \\nand earnings of €20m. Suppose that it reduces its share capital by 20% by buying back \\nits own shares at their market value, in one case at €200 per share and in another case at \\n€800 per share. It pays for the buy-back by borrowing at 3% after tax (or by liquidating \\nshort-term investments earning 3%, which amounts to the same thing).\\nBEFORE\\nPrice per \\nshare\\nBook value \\nof equity\\nMarket value \\nof equity\\nEarnings Book value \\nper share\\nEPS P/E\\n€200 €400m €200m €20m €400 €20 10\\n€800 €400m €800m €20m €400 €20 40'),\n",

The relevant anal-\\nysis, however, is at the per-share level. The repurchase is made at the current share price \\n(or at current value, if the company is not quoted), possibly increased by a premium of 5% \\nor 10% to induce holders to tender their shares under the offer.\\nWith repurchase at €200, earnings per share increase by 17.5% and decrease by 5% \\nwith repurchase at €800.\\nMore generally, repurchase of shares by the company results in an increase in earnings \\nper share (accretion) whenever the reciprocal of P/E is greater than the after-tax rate of \\ninterest paid on incremental debt (or earned on short-term debt securities). If E/P is less \\nthan the rate of interest, there is a decrease in earnings per share (dilution).\\nThe transaction is thus the inverse of a share issue, which should come as no surprise to \\nthe reader.\\nBear in mind that, although the calculation of the change in earnings per share \\nis of interest, it is not an indicator of value creation. The real issue is not whether a \\ncapital decrease will mechanically dilute earnings per share, but whether:\\ntthe price at which the shares are repurchased is less than their estimated value;\\nt the increase in the debt burden will translate into better performance by man-\\nagement; and\\nt the marginal rate of return on the funds returned to shareholders by the buy-\\nback was less than the cost of capital.\\nThese are the three sources of value creation in a capital decrease.\\nWe frequently see it argued that a capital decrease, by replacing a more costly form of \\nfinancing (equity) with a less costly one (debt), lowers the weighted average cost of capi-\\ntal. The reader who has absorbed the lessons of Modigliani and Miller and understands \\nthat cost of capital is independent from capital structure (remember “the size of a pizza is \\nthe same no matter how you slice it”?) may be indulgent. To err is human; only to persist \\nin error is diabolical!\\nA capital decrease, by itself, does not reduce a company’s cost of capital and thus can-\\nnot create value. At best, it can avoid value destruction by preventing the company from \\ninvesting cash at less than the cost of equity.\\nOnly if the company manages to buy back its shares at less than they are worth could \\nit hope to create value. The theory of markets in equilibrium leaves little hope of being \\nable to do this.\\nShare buy-backs are becoming a normal way of reallocating cash from mature businesses \\nto newer sectors or faster-growing companies.'),\n",

This \\nis the major reason for which changes in the dividend policy generally occur very slowly \\nand produce effects on the capital structure only after some periods.\\nConversely, capital reductions and extraordinary dividends are specific una tantum \\ndecisions, and investors do not expect any regularity regarding them. They can perfectly \\nfit situations where the company wants to distribute the cash generated by an important \\nasset or intends to modify the capital structure rapidly.\\nShare buy-back programmes are as flexible and are appropriate for returning tem-\\nporary excess cash flows to shareholders pending an increase in payout, a drop in earn-\\nings, or an increase of the company’s investment needs. Groups used such programmes \\nfrequently until 2007 before they were phased out in 2008–2009.\\nBesides the regular annual ordinary dividend, Bouygues returns excess cash flows \\nin the form of share buy-backs. In 2005 when it sold its water distribution arm, given \\nthe lack of material investment opportunities, Bouygues distributed an extraordinary \\ndividend of €1.6bn. In September 2011, the Bouygues family took the opportunity of a \\ndrop in share price to increase their stake in the capital, without investing cash, through \\na €1.25m reduction of capital (12% of capital) in which they did not participate.\\n2/ SIGNALLING\\nAll financial decisions send signals to investors, and thus the company must ponder the \\nexpected perception investors may have following the adoption of a specific financial \\ndecision.'),\n",

Moreover, it benefits all investors.\\nChanges in ordinary dividends and capital reductions, however, are clearly perceived \\nas signals sent to the market: in the former case, regarding the level of future earnings; in \\nthe latter case, regarding the stock price because a company would not buy a portion of its \\nshares if the management believed that the shares were overvalued.\\nJagannathan et al. (2000) have demonstrated that share buy-backs give little informa-\\ntion about future results compared to dividends. While companies that increase dividends \\nshow an improvement of results, a similar conclusion cannot be reached with share buy-\\nbacks. The distribution of dividends contains a commitment from the management to \\nmaintaining the same level of dividend (or increasing them) for a certain number of peri-\\nods; share buy-backs do not imply an analogous commitment. Thus, cyclical companies \\nare more inclined to use share buy-backs than non-cyclical companies.\\n3/ IMPACT ON SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE\\nOrdinary and extraordinary dividends do not affect the shareholding structure because \\nthey do not modify the number of outstanding shares. On the contrary, capital reductions \\nand share buy-backs affect shareholder composition because some shareholders may sim-\\nply decide not to participate in the capital reduction or to sell their shares in the case of a \\nshare buy-back. Their percentage of control increases.\\nAs an example, the buy-back offer of Havas on 12% of its capital allowed Bolloré to \\nincrease its stake from 33% to 37% in 2012. An increase in dividend would probably have \\nbeen complex in such a cyclical sector as advertising; a special dividend would not have \\nallowed for an impact on shareholding.\\n4/ IMPACT ON STOCK OPTIONS\\nAccording to the current legislation of some countries, the capital reduction realised by \\nbuying back shares at a high price requires an adjustment of the exercise price of the stock \\noptions with a neutral effect on stock option holders.\\nHowever, some legal systems do not regulate similar adjustments in the case of ordi-\\nnary or extraordinary dividends. Since an extraordinary dividend can strongly reduce \\nthe stock price, the absence of any adjustment of the exercise price of the stock options \\nexplains why this instrument is not favoured by the management.\\nThe strong decrease in the number of companies distributing a dividend (66% in \\n1978 vs. 21% in 1999) in America until early this century can also be at least partially \\nexplained by the increasing popularity of share buy-backs, probably pushed up by the \\nmanagers holding stock options.\\nIn fact, the distribution of a dividend mechanically reduces the stock price, thus \\ndecreasing the probability of a high capital gain for stock option holders. The share buy-\\nback does not generate this negative effect on the value of the stock options. It also leaves \\nunsophisticated investors believing that the stock price will go up.'),\n",

For individual inves-\\ntors belonging to the top classes of personal income, generally speaking taxation is lower \\non capital gains than ordinary dividends. This pushes shareholders to consider share \\nrepurchases more favourably.\\nIn the United States, taxation on dividends for individual investors has been consider-\\nably sweetened since 2003, and now stands at 15%. This has restored the attractiveness \\nof periodical dividends and penalised capital gains, which, in fact, are now the dominant \\nway of distributing cash in the United States.\\nThe summary of this chapter can be downloaded from www.vernimmen.com.\\nWithin the framework of equilibrium market theory, dividend policy has little importance. \\nThe shareholder is indifferent about receiving a dividend and letting the company reinvest \\nthe cash in assets that will earn the rate of return he requires. His wealth is the same in \\neither case.\\nSignalling theory interprets dividends as information communicated by managers to inves-\\ntors about future earnings. A rise in the dividend signals good news; a cut signals bad news.\\nAgency theory interprets dividends as a means of mitigating conﬂicts between owners and \\nmanagers. Paying a dividend reduces the amount of cash that managers are able to invest \\nwithout much control on the part of shareholders. On the other hand, paying a dividend \\naggravates conﬂicts between owners and lenders when the amount of that dividend is \\nsigniﬁcant.\\nAll things considered, dividend policy should be judged on the basis of the company’s mar-\\nginal rate of return on capital employed. If that rate is above the weighted average cost \\nof capital, the dividend can be low or nil because the company is creating value when it \\nreinvests its earnings. If the marginal rate of return is below the cost of capital, shareholders \\nare better off if the company distributes all its earnings to them.\\nAs long as the company has opportunities to invest at a satisfactory return, managers set a \\ntarget dividend payout ratio that will be higher or lower depending on whether the company \\nhas reached maturity or is still growing. Fluctuations in net earnings can be smoothed over \\nin the per-share dividend so that it does not move erratically and send the wrong signal to \\ninvestors.\\nThe reader should not forget that, to some extent, dividend policy determines the composi-\\ntion of the shareholder body: paying no dividends leads to low loyalty on the part of share-\\nholders, who must regularly sell shares to meet their needs for cash.\\nA capital decrease can take the form of either a reduction in the par value of all shares via \\ndistribution to shareholders of the corresponding amount of cash, or by a buy-back of shares \\nin which shareholders are free to participate or not, as they see ﬁt.\\nA capital decrease may be undertaken for several different purposes: to return funds to share-\\nholders when managers are unable to ﬁnd investment projects meeting the shareholders’ \\nreturn requirements; to signal an undervalued share price; as an indirect means of increasing \\nthe percentage of control held by shareholders that do not take part in the buy-back; or to \\ndistribute cash to shareholders at a lower tax cost than by paying a dividend.\\nSUMMARY'),\n",

To perform financial analysis, you must first \\nunderstand the firm’s basic financial mechanics (Chapters 2–5).

Accordingly, liabili-\\nties are classified into those due in the short term (less than one year), in the medium and \\nlong term (more than one year) and those that are not due for repayment.\\nLikewise, what the company owns can also be classified by duration as follows:\\nt assets that will have disappeared from the balance sheet by the following year, which \\ncomprise current assets in the vast majority of cases;'),\n",

       "\"Step 1: Understand what a bank is\\nA bank is an institution that provides financial services to individuals and businesses. Its primary function is to manage money by accepting deposits, making loans, and facilitating payments.\\n\\nStep 2: Know the different types of banks\\nThere are several types of banks, including:\\n\\n- Commercial banks: These banks provide basic banking services such as accepting deposits, making loans, and processing transactions.\\n- Investment banks: These banks specialize in providing financial advice and executing financial transactions related to mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and other corporate finance activities.\\n- Central banks: These banks serve as the country's monetary authority and are responsible for managing the money supply, regulating the banking system, and implementing monetary policies.\\n- Online banks or digital banks: These banks operate entirely online, offering electronic banking services and eliminating traditional branch networks.\\n\\nStep 3: Understand bank accounts\\nBank accounts are a crucial part of a bank's service offerings. They allow customers to store their funds safely, earn interest if applicable, and access their money when needed. There are various types of bank accounts, including:\\n\\n- Savings accounts: These accounts encourage saving by offering a fixed or variable interest rate.\\n- Checking accounts: These accounts provide easy access to deposited funds for everyday transactions.\\n- Money market accounts: These accounts offer limited check-writing privileges and earn higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts.\\n- Certificates of deposit (CDs): These accounts require a fixed deposit period, and customers receive a fixed rate of return during that time.\\n\\nStep 4: Understand bank services\\nBanks provide various financial services to their customers. Some common examples include:\\n\\n- Payments processing: Banks facilitate transactions between individuals or businesses by providing payment systems such as credit cards, debit cards, wire transfers, and online bill payments.\\n- Loans: Banks offer loans to individuals and businesses for personal or business purposes, often with fixed interest rates and repayment terms.\\n- Credit cards: Banks issue credit cards that allow customers to borrow money from the bank and pay it back within a specified time frame, usually with interest charges.\\n- Investment products: Some banks offer investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and insurance policies.\\n- Retirement accounts: Many banks provide retirement savings options like 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\\n\\nStep 5: Learn about bank regulation\\nBanks are heavily regulated to ensure financial stability and protect customer interests. Central banks and government agencies oversee banking practices, and regulations may vary depending on the country or region.\\n\\nStep 6: Understand the role of banks in economic growth\\nBanks play a crucial role in promoting economic growth by providing access to capital for businesses, facilitating transactions, and storing value through deposits. They also help stabilize the economy by managing liquidity and participating in monetary policy decisions.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of what a bank is, its different types, services offered, regulation, and role in economic growth.\""
