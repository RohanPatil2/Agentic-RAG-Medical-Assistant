Present \\nconsumption is sacrificed to get a return in the future. The sacrifice that has to be borne is \\ncertain but the return in the future may be uncertain. This attribute of investment indicates \\nthe risk factor. The risk is undertaken with a view to reap some return from the investment. \\nFor a layman, investment means some monetary commitment. A person’s commitment to \\nbuy a flat or a house for his personal use may be an investment from his point of view. This \\ncannot be considered as an actual investment as it involves sacrifice but does not yield any \\nfinancial return.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='4\\n To the economist, investment is the net addition made to the nation’s capital stock \\nthat consists of goods and services that are used in the production process. A net addition \\nto the capital stock means an increase in the buildings, equipments or inventories. These \\ncapital stocks are used to produce other goods and services.\\n Financial investment is the allocation of money of assets that are expected to yield \\nsome gain over a period of time. It is an exchange of financial claims such as stocks and \\nbonds for money. They are expected to yield returns and experience capital growth over the \\nyears.\\n The financial and economic meanings are related to each other because the savings of \\nthe individual flow into the capital market as financial investments, to be used in economic \\ninvestment. Even though they are related to each other, we are concerned only about the \\nfinancial investment made on securities.\\n Thus, investment may be defined as “a commitment of funds made in the expectation \\nof some positive rate of return” . Expectation of return is an essential element of investment. \\n Since the return is expected to be realized in future, there is a possibility that the \\nreturn actually realized is lower than the return expected to be realized. This possibility of \\nvariation in the actual return is known as investment risk. Thus, every investment involves \\nreturn and risk.\\nCharacteristics of Investment\\nAll investments are characterized by certain features. Let us analyse these \\ncharacteristic features of investment.\\nReturn\\nAll investments are characterized by the expectation of a return. In fact, investments \\nare made with the primary objective of deriving a return. The return may be received in the \\nform of yield plus capital appreciation. \\nThe difference between the sale price and the purchase price is capital appreciation. \\nThe dividend or interest received from the investment is the yield. Different types of \\ninvestments promise different rates of return. The return from an investment depends upon \\nthe nature of the investment, the maturity period and a host of other factors. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='5\\nRisk\\nRisk is inherent in any investment. This risk may relate to loss of capital, delay \\nin repayment of capital, non-payment of interest, or variability of returns. While some \\ninvestments like government securities and bank deposits are almost riskless, others are \\nmore risky. \\nThe risk of an investment depends on the following factors.\\n1. The longer the maturity period, the larger is the risk.\\n2. The lower the credit worthiness of the borrower, the higher is the risk.\\n3. The risk varies with the nature of investment. Investments in ownership securities \\nlike equity shares carry higher risk compared to investments in debt instruments \\nlike debentures and bonds.\\n Risk and return of an investment are related. Normally, the higher the risk, the \\nhigher is the return.\\nSafety\\nThe safety of on investment implies the certainty of return of capital without loss \\nof money or time. Safety is another feature which an investor desires for his investments. \\nEvery investor expects to get back his capital on maturity without loss and without delay.\\nLiquidity\\nAn investment which is easily saleable or marketable without loss of money and \\nwithout loss of time is said to possess liquidity. Some investments like company deposits, \\nbank deposits, P .O. Deposits, NSC, NSS, etc. are not marketable. \\nSome investment instruments like preference shares and debentures are marketable, \\nbut there are no buyers in many cases and hence their liquidity is negligible. Equity shares \\nof companies listed on stock exchanges are easily marketable through the stock exchanges.\\n An investor generally prefers liquidity for his investments, safety of his funds, a good \\nreturn with minimum risk or minimization of risk and maximization of return.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='6\\nObjectives of Investment\\n An investor has various alternative avenues of investment for his savings to flow to. \\nSavings kept as cash are barren and do not earn anything. Hence, savings are invested in \\nassets depending on their risk and return characteristics. The objectives of the investor are \\nminimizing the risk involved in investment and maximize the return from the investment.\\n Our savings kept as cash are not only barren because they do not earn anything, but \\nalso loses its value to the extent of rise in prices. Thus, rise in prices or inflation erodes the \\nvalue of money. Savings are invested to provide a hedge or protection against inflation. If \\nthe investment cannot earn as much as the rise in prices, the real rate of return would be \\nnegative. Thus, if inflation is at an average annual rate of ten percent, then the return from \\nan investment should be above ten percent to induce savings to flow into investment. \\nThus, the objectives of an investor can be stated as:\\n  ➢ Maximisation of return.\\n  ➢ Minimization of risk\\n  ➢ Hedge against inflation.\\nInvestors, in general, desire to earn as large returns as possible with the minimum \\nof risk. Risk here may be understood as the probability that actual returns realized from an \\ninvestment may be different from the expected return. If we consider the financial assets \\navailable for investment, we can classify them into different risk categories. Government \\nsecurities would constitute the low risk category as they are practically risk free. Debentures \\nand preference shares of companies may be classified as medium risk assets. Equity shares \\nof companies would form the high risk category of financial assets. An investor would be \\nprepared to assume higher risk only if he expects to get proportionately higher returns. \\nThere is a trade-off between risk and return. The expected return of an investment is \\ndirectly proportional to its risk. Thus, in the financial market, there are different financial \\nassets with varying risk-return combinations.\\nInvestment Vs Speculation\\nInvestment and speculation are two terms which are closely related. Both involve \\npurchase of assets like shares and securities. Traditionally, investment is distinguished from \\nspeculation with respect to three factors, viz. (1) risk, (2) capital gain and (3) time period.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='7\\nRisk\\nIt refers to the possibility of incurring a loss in a financial transaction. It arises \\nfrom the possibility of variation in returns from an investment. Risk is invariably related to \\nreturn. Higher return is associated with higher risk.\\nNo investment is completely risk free. An investor generally commits his funds to \\nlow risk investment, whereas a speculator commits his funds to higher risk investments. A \\nspeculator is prepared to take higher risks in order to achieve higher returns.\\nCapital Gain\\nThe speculator’s motive is to achieve profits through price charges, i.e. he is \\ninterested in capital gains rather than the income from the investment. If purchase of \\nsecurities is preceded by proper investigation and analysis to receive a stable return and \\ncapital appreciation over a period of time, it is investment. \\nThus, speculation is associated with buying low and selling high with the hope \\nof making large capital gains. A speculator consequently engages in frequent buying and \\nselling transactions.\\nTime Period\\nInvestment is long-term in nature, whereas speculation is short-term. An investor \\ncommits his funds for a longer period and waits for his return. But a speculator is interested \\nin short-term trade gains through buying and selling of investment instruments.\\nAnalysis of these distinctions helps us to identify the role of an investor and a \\nspeculator. An investor is interested in a good rate of return earned on a rather consistent \\nbasis for a relatively longer period of time. He evaluates the worth of a security before \\ninvesting in it. A speculator seeks opportunities promising very large returns earned rather \\nquickly. He is interested in market action and price movements. Consequently, speculation \\nis more risky than investment. \\n Basically, both investment and speculation aim at good returns. The difference is in \\nmotives and methods. As a result, the distinction between investment and speculation is \\nnot very wide. Investment is sometimes described as a well grounded and carefully planned \\nspeculation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='8\\nInvestment Vs Gambling\\nInvestment has also to be distinguished from gambling. Typical examples of gambling \\nare horse races, card games, lotteries, etc. Gambling consists in taking high risks not only for \\nhigh returns, but also for thrill and excitement. Gambling is unplanned and non scientific, \\nwithout knowledge of the nature of the risk involved. It is surrounded by uncertainty and \\nis based on tips and rumors. In gambling artificial and unnecessary risks are created for \\nincreasing the returns.\\n Investment is an attempt to carefully plan, evaluate and allocate funds to various \\ninvestment outlets which offer safety of principal and moderate and continuous return over \\na long period of time. Gambling is quite the opposite of investment.\\nTypes of Investors\\nInvestors may be individuals and institutions. Individual investors operate alongside \\ninstitutional investors in the investment arena. However, their characteristics are different.\\n Individual investors are large in number but their investable resources are \\ncomparatively smaller. They generally lack the skill to carry out extensive evaluation and \\nanalysis before investing. Moreover, they do not have the time and resources to engage in \\nsuch an analysis.\\n Institutional investors, on the other hand, are the organizations with surplus funds \\nwho engage in investment activities. Mutual funds, investment companies, banking and \\nnon-banking companies, insurance corporations, etc. are the organizations with large \\namounts of surplus funds to be invested in various profitable avenues. \\n These institutional investors are fewer in number compared to individual investors, \\nbut their investable resources are much larger. The institutional investors engage professional \\nfund managers to carry out extensive analysis and evaluation of different investment \\nopportunities. \\n As a result their investment activity tends to be more rational and scientific. They \\nhave a better chance of maximizing returns and minimizing risk.\\n The professional investors and the unskilled individual investors combine to make \\nthe investment arena dynamic.'),\n",

Some of them \\nare marketable and liquid while others are non marketable. Some of them are highly risky \\nwhile some others are almost riskless. The investor has to choose proper avenues from \\namong them depending on his preferences, needs and ability to assume risk.\\nThe investment avenues can be broadly categorized under the following heads:\\n1. Corporate securities \\n2. Deposits in banks and non-banking companies\\n3. UTI and other mutual fund schemes\\n4. Post office deposits and certificates\\n5. Life insurance polices\\n6. Provident fund schemes\\n7. Government and semi-government securities.\\nCorporate Securities\\nCorporate securities are the securities issued by joint stock companies in the private \\nsector. These include equity shares, preference shares and debentures. Equity shares have \\nvariable divided and hence belong to the high risk-high return category, while preference \\nshares and debentures have fixed returns with lower risk.\\nDeposits\\nAmong the non-corporate investments, the most popular are deposits with banks \\nsuch as savings accounts and fixed deposits. Savings deposits have low interest rates whereas \\nfixed deposits have higher interest rates varying with the period of maturity. \\nInterest is payable quarterly or half-yearly. Fixed deposits may also be recurring \\ndeposits wherein savings are deposited at regular intervals. Some banks have reinvestment \\nplans wherein the interest is reinvested as it gets accrued. The principal and accumulated \\ninterests are paid on maturity.\\nJoint stock companies also accept fixed deposits from the public. The maturity \\nperiod varies from three to five years. Fixed deposits in companies have high risk since they \\nare unsecured, but they promise higher returns than bank deposits.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='10\\nFixed deposit in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is another investment \\navenue open to savers. NBFCs include leasing companies, investment companies, chit funds, \\netc. Deposits in NSFCs carry higher returns with higher risk compared to bank deposits. \\nUTI and Other Mutual Fund Schemes\\nMutual funds offer various investment schemes to investors. UTI is the oldest and \\nthe largest mutual fund in the country. Unit Scheme 1964, Unit Linked Insurance Plan \\n1971, Master Share, Master Equity Plans, Master gain, etc. are some of the popular schemes \\nof UTI. A number of commercial banks and financial institutions have set up mutual funds. \\nRecently mutual funds have been set up in the private sector also.\\nPost Office Deposits and Certificates\\nThe investment avenues provided by post offices are generally non-marketable. \\nMoreover, the major investments in post office enjoy tax concessions also. Post office \\naccepts savings deposits as well as fixed deposits from the public. There is also recurring \\ndeposit scheme which is an instrument of regular monthly savings.\\n Six-year National Savings Certificates (NSC) are issued by post office to investors. \\nThe interest on the amount invested is compounded half-yearly and to payable along with \\nthe principal at the time of maturity which is six years from the date of issue.\\nIndira Vikas Patra and Kissan Vikas Patra are savings certificates issued by post officers.\\nLife Insurance Policies\\nThe Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) offers many investment schemes to investors. \\nThese schemes have the additional facility of life insurance cover. Some of the schemes \\nof LIC are whole Life Polices, Convertible Whole Life Assurance Polices, Endowment \\nAssurance Polices, Jeevan Saathi, Money Back Plan, Jeevan Dhara, Marriage Endownment \\nPlan etc.\\nProvident Fund Schemes\\n Provident fund schemes are compulsory deposit schemes applicable to employees \\nin the public and private sectors. There are three kinds of provident funds applicable to \\ndifferent sectors of employment, namely Statutory Provident Fund, Recognised Provident \\nFund and Unrecognised Provident Fund.'),\n",

This is known as the Public Provident Fund (PPF). \\nAny member of the public can join the scheme which is operated by the post offices and the \\nState Bank of India.\\nGovernment and Semi-Government Securities\\nThe government and semi-Government bodies like the public sector undertakings \\nborrow money from the public through the issue of government securities and public \\nsector bonds. These are less risky avenues of investment because of the credibility of the \\ngovernment and government undertakings.\\n****'),\n",

In the early nineties, the stock market \\nwas the best and safety place for the common individual to invest. Since 1996 the share \\nmarket prices have been low. This made the retail investors to turn away from the stock \\nmarket. The characteristic features of the equity are given in the previous chapter.\\n The stock market classifies shares into Growth shares, Income shares, Defensive \\nshares, Cyclical shares and Speculative shares.\\n1) Growth Shares The stocks that have higher rate of growth than the industrial growth \\nrate in profitability are referred to as growth shares. For example, the list of major \\ngainers for 1996 is dominated by software sector stocks. The HCL and Info systems \\nshare prices increased sharply.\\n2) Income Shares These stocks belong to companies that have comparatively stable \\noperations and limited growth opportunities. The bank shares and some of the fast \\nmoving consumer goods stocks such as Cadburys, Nestle and Hindustan Lever may \\nbe termed as income shares.\\n3) Defensive Shares Defensive stocks are relatively unaffected by the market movements. \\nFor example, a host of pharmaceutical stocks posted returns in excess of 50 per cent \\nin 1998. The pharmaceutical industry owing to its inherent nature of demand is not \\naffected by the down turn in the economy.\\n4) Cyclical Shares The business cycle affects the cyclical shares. The upward and \\ndownward movements of the business cycle affect the business prospects of certain \\ncompanies and their stock prices. Such shares provide low to moderate current yield. \\nCapital gain may be highly variable. For example, the automobile sector stocks are \\naffected by the business cycles.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='13\\n5) Speculative Shares Shares that have lot of speculative trading in them are reffered \\nto as speculative shares. During the bull and bear phases of the market, this type of \\nshares attracts the attention of the trades.\\nThe stocks, which fall under one category in one period, may switch over to another \\ncategory in another period. The classification should not be considered rigid. For example, \\ngrowth shares may be speculative shares.\\nFixed Income Securities\\nI) Preference Shares\\nA detailed description of the preference shares is given in chapter 1. Preference \\nshares are no longer regarded as inferior to the equity capital. Corporate like Siemens has \\nplaced ` 150 Cr. Worth of preference shares. High tax paying companies or investors prefer \\nto subscribe to the preference shares and investors with a low tax burden would prefer to go \\nin for debt instruments. The conversion options provided in the by preference shares also \\nmake it attractive. The biggest advantage is the tax-exempt status of the preference share’s \\ndividend.\\nII) Debentures\\nCorporate debentures are an option available to the investors who are sacrifice \\nliquidity for higher return. Manufacturing companies like Gujarat Industries Power and \\nTISCO have issued debentures. If the debentures are not actively traded in the debt segment \\nof the capital market, the investors may have to hold the instrument till maturity. If the \\ninstruments were actively traded in the secondary market, it would have perhaps changed \\nhands at a considerable premium, thereby lowering the yield on par with the present interest \\nrate. These reasons contribute towards high coupon rates on debentures.\\nIII) Bonds\\nBonds are similar to the debentures but they are issued by the public sector un -\\ndertakings. The value of the bond in the market depends upon the interest rate and the \\nmaturity. The coupon rate is the nominal interest rate offered on the bonds. The coupon \\nrate is contractual involving the terms and conditions of the issuance of the debt security. \\nBeing contractual it cannot be changed during the tenure of the instrument. The investors \\nare not affected by lowering of the bank rates. When the bank rates are lowered, actually,  \\nthe value of the bonds, which are carrying interest rates above the bank rate would appreci -'),\n",

IDBI and ICICI have issued various bonds to suit the needs of the investors. Some of \\nthem are deep discount bond, education benefit bond, retirement benefit bond and index \\nbond.\\nIV) IVPs AND KVPs\\nThese are saving certificates issued by the post office with the name Indira VikasPatra \\n(IVP) and KisanVikasPatra (KVP). The IVPs are in the face value of ` 500, 1000 and 5000. \\nThe KVPs are in the denomination of ` 1000, 5000 and 10000. The capital is doubled in 5.5 \\nyears with the return of 13.47%. IVPs are like bearer bounds, transferable by hand delivery \\nand therefore are attractive to the persons who prefer cash transactions. No income tax \\nconcession is available for this type of investment.\\n6) Government Securities  The securities issued by the Central, State Government \\nand Quasi Government agencies are known as Government securities or gilt edged \\nsecurities. As Government guaranteed security is a claim on the Government, it is a \\nsecured financial instrument, which guarantees the income and the capital. The rate \\nof interest on these securities is relatively lower because of their high liquidity and \\nsafety.\\n7) Money Market Securities  Money market securities have very short term maturity \\nsay less than a year. Common money market instruments are:\\n  ➢ Treasury bills\\n  ➢ Commercial paper\\n  ➢ Certificate of deposit \\nTreasury Bills\\nA treasury bill is basically an instrument of short term borrowing by the Government \\nof India. To develop the Treasury bill market and provide investors with financial instruments \\nof varying short-term maturities and to facilitate the cash management requirements of \\nvarious segments of the economy, in April 1997 treasury bills of varied maturities were \\nintroduced. 14-day Treasury bill on a weekly basis was introduced from June 6, 1997. In the \\nsecond half of 1997-98, Treasury bill of 28-day was introduced on auction basis. Further, \\nit was decided to reintroduced 182-day treasury bills through auctions. Generally, treasury \\nbills are of 91-days. Since the interest rates offered on the offered on the treasury bills are \\nvery low, individuals very rarely invest in them.'),\n",

The maturity period of commercial paper was originally three (minimum) \\nto six (maximum) months from the date of issue. In Oct 1993, the maximum period was \\nextended to one year. The commercial papers are sold at a discount and redeemed at \\ntheir face value. The discounted value implicated the interest rate. The denomination of \\ncommercial paper is high. Mostly the companies and institutional investors favour them. \\nThe minimum maturity of CP was brought down from 3 months to 30 days.\\nCertificate of Deposit\\nThe certificate of deposit is a marketable receipt of funds deposited in a bank for a \\nfixed period at a specified rate of interest. They are bearer documents and readily negotiable. \\nThe denominations of the CD and the interest rate on them are high. It is mainly preferred \\nby institutional investors and companies rather than the individuals. The minimum size of \\nthe certificate is ` 10 lakh. The additional amount is issued in multiples of ` 5 lakh.\\nNon-Negotiable Securities \\nDeposits\\nDeposits earn fixed rate of return. Even though bank deposits resemble fixed income \\nsecurities they are not negotiable instruments. Some of the deposits are dealt subsequently.\\na) Bank Deposits \\nIt is the simple investment avenue open for the investors. He has to open an account \\nand deposit the money. Traditionally the banks offered current account, savings account \\nand fixed deposit account. Current account does not offer any interest rate. The drawback \\nof having large amounts in savings accounts is that the return is just 4.5 per cent. The \\nsavings account interest rate is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and kept low because \\nof the high cost of servicing them. The savings account is more liquid and convenient to \\nhandle. The fixed account carries high interest rate and the money is locked up for a fixed \\nperiod. With increasing competition among the banks, the banks have bundled the plain \\nsavings account with the fixed account to cater to the needs of the small savers.

The NBFCs not having net owned funds of ` 25 lakh are not \\nentitled to accept deposits.\\nc. Internet  NBFCs offer interest rate higher than the commercial bank on public \\ndeposit. The interest rate differs according to maturity period. There is a disparity \\nin the interest rate among the companies in accordance with the credit ratings and \\npolicies of the companies. Even the companies with similar credit ratings provide \\ndifferent interest rates for their deposits. Generally, companies with lower credit \\nratings offer higher interest rates to cover the risk.

To improve the liquidity of NBFCs the percentage of liquid assets required \\nto be maintained by them has been enhanced from 12.5 percent to 15 percent with \\neffect from April 1999 respectively. Company Law Board is authorised to direct the \\ndefaulting NBFCs to repay the deposits. In spite of the strict rules and regulations \\nlaid down by RBI the default rate is high in the case of NBFCs.\\nTax Sheltered Savings Scheme\\nTax sheltered savings schemes are of great importance to the investors in the tax-\\npaying category. The tax sheltered savings schemes offer tax relief to those who participate \\nin their schemes according to the income tax laws. The important tax sheltered savings \\nschemes are\\n  ➢ Public Provident Fund Scheme\\n  ➢ National Savings Scheme\\n  ➢ National Savings Certificate VIII series\\na) Public Provident Fund Scheme (PPF)  \\nPPF earns an interest rate of 12 percent per year, which is exempted from the \\nincome tax under sec 88. The individuals and Hindu undivided families can participate \\nin this scheme. The maximum limit per annum for the deposit is ` 60,000. The interest is \\naccumulated in the deposit. It provides early withdrawal facilities from 7(1 year and every \\nyear thereafter, the account holder has an option to withdraw 50 per cent of the balance \\nto his credit 4 years ago or 1 year ago whichever is lower. The facility makes PPF a self-\\nsustaining account from 71h year onwards.\\nb) National Savings Scheme (NSS)  \\nThis scheme helps in deferring the tax payment. Individuals and 1-IUF are eligible \\nto open NSS account in the designated post office. The NSS-87 gives 100 per cent income \\ntax rebate but the interest as well as the capital are fully taxable if withdrawn during  \\ntheir lifetime. Investments in the NSS scheme, with a lock in period of 4 years qualify  \\nfor a rebate of 20 per cent under Section 88 of the Income Tax Act, subject to a maximum \\nof ` 12,000. The investment also earns an interest rate of 11 per cent pr year covered by  \\nSec 80L. Compared to other tax savings’ instruments the return offered by this scheme is \\nlower.'),\n",

The entire amount can be \\nwithdrawn. The account can be closed on the expiry of 4 years. There is no fixed tenure for \\ninvestment. One can also keep the account alive and earn interest at 11 percent per annum.\\nAs a tax saving instrument “anytime” withdrawal after 4 years is the only interesting \\nfeature to the prospective investor. The tax deduction at source at the rate of 20 percent on \\nthe entire amount withdrawn has proved too costly to the investors.\\nc) National Savings Certificate (NSC)\\nThis scheme is offered by the post office. These certificates come in the denominations \\nof ` 500, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000. The contribution and the interest for the first 5 years are \\ncovered by Sec 88. The interest is cumulative at the rate of 12% per annum and payable \\nbiannually is covered by Sec 80L. No withdrawals are permitted. There is no deduction at \\nmaturity.\\nLife Insurance\\nLife insurance is a contract for payment of a sum of money to the person assured \\n(or to the person entitled to receive the same) on the happening of event insured against. \\nUsually the contract provides for the payment of an amount on the date of maturity or at \\nspecified dates at periodic intervals or if unfortunate death occurs. Among other things, the \\ncontracts also provide for the payment of premium periodically to the corporation by the \\npolicy holders. Life insurance eliminates risk. \\nThe major advantages of life insurance are given below:\\ni) Protection  Saving through life insurance guarantees full protection against risk of \\ndeath of the saver. The full assured sum is paid, whereas in other schemes only the \\namount saved is paid.\\nii) Easy Payments  For the salaried people the salary savings’ schemes are introduced. \\nFurther, there is an easy instalment facility method of payment through monthly, \\nquarterly, half yearly or yearly mode.\\niii) Liquidity  Loans can be raised on the security of the policy.\\niv) Tax Relief Tax relief in Income Tax and Wealth Tax is available for amounts paid by \\nway of premium for life insurance subject to the tax rates in force.'),\n",

The funds collected from the investors are placed under \\nprofessional management for the benefit of the investors. The mutual funds are broadly \\nclassified into open-ended scheme and close-ended scheme.\\nOpen-Ended Schemes\\nThe open-ended scheme offers its units on a continuous basis and accepts funds \\nfrom investors continuously. Repurchase is carried out on a continuing basis thus, helping \\nthe investors to withdraw their money at any time. In other words, there is an uninterrupted \\nentry and exit into the funds. The open-end scheme has no maturity period and they are not \\nlisted into stock exchanges. Investor can deal directly with the mutual fund for investment \\nas well as redemption. The open-ended fund provides liquidity to the investors since the \\nrepurchase facility is available. Repurchase price is fixed on the basis of net asset value of \\nthe unit. In 1998 the open-ended schemes have crossed 80 in number.\\nClosed – Ended Funds\\nThe close-ended funds have a fixed maturity period. The first time investments are \\nmade when the close end scheme is kept open for a limited period. Once closed, the units \\nare listed on a stock exchange. Investors can buy and sell their units only through stock \\nexchanges. The demand and supply factors influence the prices of the units. The investor’s \\nexpectation also affects the unit prices. The market price may not be the same as the net \\nasset value.\\n Sometimes mutual funds with the features of close-ended and open-ended schemes \\nare launched, known as interval funds. They can be listed in the stock exchange or may be \\navailable for repurchase during specific periods at net asset value or related prices.'),\n",

Some of them are given below\\ni) Growth Scheme Aims to provide capital appreciation over medium to long term. \\nGenerally these funds invest their money in equities.\\nii) Income Scheme This scheme aims to provide a regular return to its unit holders. \\nMostly these funds deploy their funds in fixed income securities.\\niii) Balanced Scheme A combination of steady return as well as reasonable growth. The \\nfunds of these schemes are invested in equities and debt instruments.\\niv) Money Market Scheme This type of fund invests its money on money market \\ninstruments like treasury bills, commercial paper, etc.\\nv) Tax Saving Schemes  This type of scheme offers tax rebates to investors. Equity \\nlinked savings schemes and pension schemes provide exemption from capital gains \\non specific investment.\\nvi) Index Scheme Here investment is made on the equities of the index. Benchmark \\nindex is BSE sensex or NSE-50. The return are approximately equal to the return on \\nthe index.\\nReal Assets\\nGold and Silver\\nFor ages, gold and silver have been considered as a form of investment. They are \\nconsidered as best hedge against inflation. This is a favourite form of investment amongst \\nthe rural and semi-urban population. Besides, investors tend to invest in jewellery instead \\nof pure gold. As a result, when they buy jewellery, the price realization is usually less than \\ntotal purchase price (this is due to higher making charge of jewellery). The price of gold \\nhas declined in the later part of the nineties. Gold prices are suppressed because of large \\nsupplies overtaking the demand. The government has allowed imports of gold to certain \\nbanks and agencies and they have huge stocks of gold. The gold prices remained depressed \\nin the international markets too in the late nineties. The following reasons are cited for the \\nlow price of gold in the international market.\\ni) Weak demand from Asian countries which are the largest consumers of gold.\\nii) Continuing pressure on central banks to dishoard gold'),\n",

The substantial increase in domestic demand for gold was met by ease \\nof supply facilities by (i) allowing non-resident Indians to import 10kg. of gold (as against \\n5kg. earlier) once in every six months with effect from January 1, 1997, (ii) allowing 12 \\nauthorised agencies to import gold under Open General Licence (OGL) without any limit \\non quantity and sell it in the local market against rupees after payment of approximately \\n5 percent duty and (iii) lower prices in the international market.

They are optimistic about the rise in silver price.\\nReal Estate\\nThe real estate market offers a high return to the investors. The word real estate \\nmeans land and buildings. There is a normal notion that the price of the real estate has \\nincreased by more than 12 percent over the past ten years. The population growth and the \\nexodus of people towards the urban cities have made the prices to increase manifold. The \\nprice of the residential area land generally in South Mumbai ranges from a high of ` 19,400 \\nper sq.ft. at Kemps Corner to a low of ` 8,400 per sq.ft. at Cuffe Parke in 1998. Recently, \\nthe recession in the economy has affected the price of the real estate. Prices, marked a \\nsubstantial fall in 1998 from the 1997 prices. Reasons for investing in real estate are give \\nbelow:\\n1. High capital appreciation compared to gold or silver particularly in the urban area. \\n2. Availability of loans for the construction of houses. The 1999-2000 budget provides \\nhuge incentives to the middle class to avail of housing loans. Scheduled banks now \\nhave to disburse 3 percent of their incremental deposits in housing finance.\\n3. Tax rebate is given to the interest paid on the housing loan. Further ` 75,000 tax \\nrebate on a loan upto ` 5 lakhs which is availed of after April 1999. If an invests in \\na house for about ` 6-7 lakh, he provides a seed capital of about ` 1-2 lakh. The ` 5 \\nlakh loan, which draws an interest rate of 15 percent, will work out to be less than 9.6 \\npercent because of the ` 75,000 exempted from tax annually. In assessing the wealth \\ntax, the value of the residential home is estimated at its historical cost and not on its \\npresent market value.\\n4. The possession of a house gives an investor a psychologically secure feeling and a \\nstanding among his friends and relatives.\\nApart from making investment in the residential houses, the people in the higher \\nincome bracket invest their money in time share plans of the holiday resorts and land \\nsituated near the city limit with the anticipation of a capital appreciation. Farm houses and \\nplantations also fall in the line. In spite of the fast capital appreciation investors generally do \\nnot invest in the real estate apart from owning one or two houses. The reasons are:\\nRequirement of Huge Capital:  To purchase a land or house in the urban area, the \\ninvestor needs money in lakhs whereas he can buy equity, gold or other form of \\ninvestment by investing thousands of rupees.'),\n",

The waiting period may be months or years.\\nThe points to be taken care of while purchasing the real estate are:\\n1. The plots should be approved by the local authority because on the unapproved \\nlayout construction of a house is not permitted.\\n2. Possibility of capital appreciation- It depends upon the locality and other facilities \\nof the site.\\n3. Originality of title deeds- The site should be free from encumbrance. Encumbrance \\ncertificate for a minimum period of latest 15 years should be got from the Registrars \\nOffice.\\n4. Plinth area should be verified.\\n5. Credibility of the broker\\n The role of broker cannot be undermined because it is he who introduces to the \\nparties and location of site. He should be faithful and loyal otherswise the investor finds \\nhimself in trouble.\\nArt\\nPaintings are most sought after form of art. The price in the art market are rising \\nand this rise is expected to continue. The trend in the market today is to invest in young \\nupcoming painters whose prices will soar over the years.

Paintings of the young painters - The works of established painters are costly and \\nscope for appreciation in their values are limited. But prices of the good quality \\npaintings of the young painters may increase quickly.\\n2. Should possess the basic idea of the painting - This is needed to decide the quality \\nof the paintings. He should be able to judge the primary attributes of the paintings \\nsuch as spontaneity, nature of strokes, colour combination and originality.\\n3. The investor should have aestheticsense -because he may or may not be able to \\nresell the paintings.

It may be a coin, sculpture, manuscript \\nor any other object of olden days. The owner of the antique has to register himself with \\nArcheological Society of India. The society after examining the authenticity of the antique \\nissues a “Certificate of registration” . Any dealings I.e. purchase and sale of antique should be \\ninformed to the society. The government has the right to buy the antique from the owner, if \\nit wants to keep it in the museum. In the case of investment, the investor has to be careful \\nabout the fake antique and the risk in the price of the antique is uncertain.\\n****'),\n",

These are traded in the securities market. Creation of a portfolio and \\nperiodic revision of the portfolio involves buying and selling of securities in the securities \\nmarket. An understanding of the working of securities market is, therefore, essential for \\npracticing portfolio management. However, the functioning of the securities market is too \\nvast a subject to be confined within a single chapter. An attempt is made in this chapter to \\nexplain the basic features of securities market.\\nFinancial Market\\nA market is a place used for buying and selling goods. This is the commonest meaning \\nof the word ‘market’ . The usual features of a market are a place, some buyers, some sellers, \\nsome commodity to be exchanged for money or some other commodity. What transpires \\nin a market is an exchange of a commodity between a buyer and a seller. However, such an \\nexchange can take place even without a common meeting place or physical space. Hence, \\na physical place is not an essential constituent of a market. It is rather the mechanism used \\nfor the exchange of goods.\\nIn an ordinary market what is usually exchanged is a physical commodity such as \\nfruits, grains, etc. In modern day markets, these commodities are valued in monetary terms \\nand exchanged for money. A commodity that is in demand is exchanged between buyers \\nand sellers in the market.\\nIn an economy, the various economic units such as individuals in the household \\nsector, business units in the industrial and commercial sector, and government organisations \\nand departments in the government sector are engaged in various economic activities and \\ntransactions involving money. Some of them spend more money than they earn and end \\nup in financial deficit while others earn more money than they spend, thus ending up in \\nfinancial surplus. The deficit generators are usually the units in the industrial, commercial \\nand government sectors. The surplus generators are mostly the units in the household \\nsector. The deficit generators who are known as ultimate borrowers would like to borrow \\nfunds from the surplus generators who are the primary lenders. Such transfer of funds is \\npossible and also necessary to sustain the development of the economy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='28\\nThe transfer of funds between primary lenders and ultimate borrowers takes place \\nthrough the creation of securities or financial assets. If an individual is not spending all \\nhis income on consumption, he will want to find a temporary repository for his current \\nsavings until they are required to finance future consumption. This involves the purchase \\nof a financial asset or security. If the investor deposits the money in the fixed deposit of a \\ncommercial bank, the bank issues him a fixed deposit receipt which is a financial asset. The \\nindividual is purchasing a financial asset and thereby transferring the surplus funds at his \\ndisposal to a financial intermediary. The bank, in turn, may lend the money to a business \\nunit through the creation of a loan agreement.\\nLet us consider another instance of transfer of funds. A company in need of funds \\nmay issue shares to mobilize funds. In a public issue of shares, any individual with surplus \\nfunds may participate. If shares are allotted to such an individual, the company which is the \\nborrower of funds will issue a share certificate to the investor who is the lender of funds. In \\nsuch a situation a financial asset in the form of a share certificate is being exchanged. This \\nexchange represents a marketing transaction and presupposes a market which nevertheless \\nhas no physical location. \\nThe commodity being exchanged is a financial asset instead of a physical asset. The \\nlender of funds (or investor) is the buyer of the asset and the borrower of funds is the seller \\nof the asset (or issuer of the security). The mechanism or system through which financial \\nassets are created and transferred is known as the financial market. When the financial \\nassets transferred are corporate securities and government securities, the mechanism of \\ntransfer is known as securities market.\\nSegments of Financial Market\\nDifferent types of securities are traded in the securities market. These may \\ninclude ownership securities, debt securities, short-term securities, long-term securities, \\ngovernment securities, non-government or corporate securities. The nature of return and \\nrisk involved in short-term securities is vastly different from that of long-term securities. \\nHence, on the basis of the maturity period of securities traded in the market, the securities \\nmarket is segmented into money market and capital market. \\nMoney market is the market for short-term financial assets with maturities of one \\nyear or less. Treasury bills, commercial bills, commercial paper, certificate of deposit, etc. \\nare the short-term securities traded in the money market. These instruments being close \\nsubstitutes for money, the market for their trading is known as money market.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='29\\nMoney market is the main source of working capital funds for business and industry. \\nIt provides a mechanism for evening out short-term surpluses and deficits. The short-term \\nrequirements of borrowers can be met by the creation of money market securities, which can \\nbe purchased by lenders with short-term surpluses to park their funds for short durations. \\nIn India, the money market has a narrow base with limited number of participants who are \\nmostly financial institutions.\\nCapital market, on the other hand, is the market segment where securities with \\nmaturities of more than one year are bought and sold. Equity shares, preference shares, \\ndebentures and bonds are the long-term securities traded in the capital market. The capital \\nmarket is the source of long-term funds for business and industry.\\nTypes of Financial Market\\nThe financial market may be classified as primary market or secondary market \\ndepending on whether the securities traded are newly issued securities or securities already \\noutstanding and owned by investors. Private companies and public sector enterprises, in \\nneed of money, may issue securities such as shares, debentures, bonds, commercial papers, \\netc. to raise required capital. Individual investors and institutional investors may invest in \\nthese securities. The market mechanism for the buying and selling of new issues of securities \\nis known as primary market. This market is also termed as new issues market because it \\ndeals in new issues of securities.\\nThe secondary market, on the other hand, deals with securities which have already \\nbeen issued and are owned by investors, both individual and institutional. These may be \\ntraded between investors. The buying and selling of securities already issued and outstanding \\ntake place in stock exchanges. Hence, stock exchanges constitute the secondary market in \\nsecurities.\\nParticipants in the Financial Market\\nA financial market is essentially a system by which financial securities are exchanged. \\nThis system is composed of participants, securities, markets, trading arrangements and \\nregulations. The major participants are the buyers and sellers of securities or the investors \\n(who are the buyers of securities) and the issuers (who are the sellers of securities). Financial \\nintermediaries are the second major class of participants in the financial system. They play \\na crucial role in the smooth functioning of the financial system. The investors who are the \\nprimary lenders in the financial system would prefer to ‘lend short’ , that is, invest their \\nsurplus for short durations as they generally have a preference for liquidity. On the contrary, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='30\\nthe issuers of securities who are the ultimate borrowers would prefer to ‘borrow long’ , that \\nis, borrow for long durations as the funds are generally required for financing long-term \\ninvestment in fixed assets. This situation gives rise to a fundamental problem in the financial \\nsystem which was described as the ‘constitutional weakness’ of unintermediated financial \\nmarkets by Hicks (1939). ’ The problem is to match the preferences of the surplus sector to \\nlend short with those of the deficit sector to borrow long. It is the financial intermediaries \\nwho resolve this problem. They borrow for short durations from the primary lenders and \\nlend for long durations to the ultimate borrowers. Through the intervention of the financial \\nintermediaries, the ultimate borrower is able to get long-term funding and the primary \\nlender is able to get liquidity on his lending.\\nThere are two types of financial intermediaries in the financial system, namely \\nbanking financial intermediaries and non-banking financial intermediaries such as insurance \\ncompanies, housing finance companies, unit trusts and investment companies. However, it \\nmay be noted that the traditional distinction between banking and non-banking institutions \\nisslowly disappearing. As a result of technological innovations and increasing competitive \\npressures, the traditional distinction between banking and non-banking activities is rapidly \\ndisappearing and a universal banking system in which a single institution provides the \\ncomplete range of financial intermediation services is slowly emerging.\\nAnother group of participants in the financial system comprises the individuals \\nand institutions who facilitate the trading or exchange process in the system. They are \\nprimarily brokers who act as agents for the primary lenders or the ultimate borrowers in the \\npurchase or sale of securities. There are also broker dealers who act on their own account by \\nbuying and selling securities for a profit. This group also includes institutions which act as \\nregistrars, managers, lead managers, share transfer agents, etc. at the time of issue of shares \\nby companies.\\nRegulatory Environment\\nThe financial system in a country is subject to a set of regulations in the form of \\nvarious Acts passed by the legislative bodies. The regulatory environment may differ from \\none country to another. In each country, the regulatory control of the financial system \\nis exercised by designated regulatory authorities. In India, the Ministry of Finance, the \\nReserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), etc. are the \\nmajor regulatory bodies exercising regulatory control and supervision over the functioning \\nof the financial system in the country.\\nA simple diagrammatic representation of how a security is raised or originated in \\nthe financial market is attempted in Fig.'),\n",

Let us analyse the functioning of this primary \\nmarket.\\nPrimary Market/New Issues Market\\nWhen a new company is floated, its shares are issued to the public in the primary \\nmarket as an Initial Public Offer (IPO). If the company subsequently decides to include \\ndebt in its capital structure by issuing bonds or debentures, these may also be floated in \\nthe primary market. Similarly, when a company decides to expand its activities using either \\nequity finance or bond finance, the additional shares or bonds may be floated in the primary \\nmarket.\\nThe primary market or new issues market (NIM) does not have a physical structure \\nor form. All the agencies which provide the facilities and participate in the process of selling \\nnew issues to the investors constitute the NIM.\\nThe NIM has three functions to perform. They are:\\n1. Origination\\n2. Underwriting\\n3. Distribution.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='32\\nOrigination\\nOrigination is the preliminary work in connection with the floatation of a new issue \\nby a company. It deals with assessing the feasibility of the project, technical, economic and \\nfinancial, as also making all arrangements for the actual floatation of the issue. As part of\\nthe origination work, decisions may have to be taken on the following issues: \\n1. Time of floating the issue\\n2. Type of issue\\n3. Price of the issue.\\nTiming of the issue is crucial for its success. The floatation of the issue should \\ncoincide with the buoyant mood in the investment market to ensure proper support and \\nsubscription to the issue. The type of issue whether equity, preference, debentures or \\nconvertible securities, has to be properly analysed at the time of origination work. Pricing of \\nthe issue is a sensitive matter, as the public support to a new issue will depend on the price \\nof the issue to a large extent. In the primary market, the price of the security is determined \\nby the issuer and not by the market. New issues are made either at par or at premium. Well- \\nestablished companies may be able to sell their shares at a premium at the time of a new \\nissue. Further, the pricing of new issues is also regulated by the guidelines on capital issues \\nissued by SEBI.\\nThe origination function in the NIM is now being carried out by merchant bankers. \\nIn the 1980s, commercial banks in India created special divisions called merchant banking \\ndivisions to perform the origination function for floatation of new issues. But now there are \\nseparate institutions registered with SEBI as merchant bankers.\\nUnderwriting\\nThe second function performed by NIM is underwriting which is the activity \\nof providing a guarantee to the issuer to ensure successful marketing of the issue. An \\nunderwriter is an individual or institution which gives an undertaking to the stock issuing \\ncompany to purchase a specified number of shares of the company in the event of a shortfall \\nin subscription to the new issue. The stock issuing company can thus ensure full subscription \\nto the new issue through underwriting agreements with different underwriters, even if there \\nis no proper response to the new issue from the investors. Underwriting activity in the NIM \\nis performed by large financial institutions such as LIC, UTI, IDBI, IFCI, general insurance \\ncompanies, commercial banks and also by brokers. The underwriters earn commission \\nfrom the issuing company for this activity.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='33\\nDistribution\\nThe new issue market performs a third function besides the functions of origination \\nand underwriting. This third function is that of distribution of shares. The distribution \\nfunction is carried out by brokers, sub-brokers and agents. New issues have to be publicised \\nby using different mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, radio, Internet, \\netc. New issues are also publicized by mass mailing. It has become a general practice to \\ndistribute prospectus, application forms and other literature regarding new issues among \\nthe investing public.\\nMethods of Floating New Issues\\nThe methods by which new issues of shares are floated in the primary market in India are:\\n1. Public issue\\n2. Rights issue\\n3. Private placement.\\nPublic Issue\\nPublic issue involves sale of securities to members of the public. The issuing company \\nmakes an offer for sale to the public directly of a fixed number of shares at a specific price. \\nThe offer is made through a legal document called Prospectus. Thus a public issue is an \\ninvitation by a company to the public to subscribe to the securities offered through a \\nprospectus. Public issues are mostly underwritten by strong public financial institutions. \\nThis is the most popular method for floating securities in the new issue market, but it \\ninvolves an elaborate process and consequently it is an expensive method. The company \\nhas to incur expenses on various activities such as advertisements, printing of prospectus, \\nbanks’ commissions, underwriting commissions, agents’ fees, legal charges, etc.\\nRights Issue\\nThe rights issue involves selling of securities to the existing shareholders in proportion \\nto their current holding. As per section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956, when a company \\nissues additional equity capital it has to be offered first to the existing shareholders on a \\npro rata basis. However, the shareholders may forfeit this special right by passing a special \\nresolution and thereby enable the company to issue additional capital to the public through \\na public issue. Rights issue is an inexpensive method of floatation of shares as the offer is \\nmade through a formal letter to the existing shareholders.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='34\\nPrivate Placement\\nA private placement is a sale of securities privately by a company to a selected group \\nof investors. The securities are normally placed, in a private placement, with the institutional \\ninvestors, mutual funds or other financial institutions. The terms of the issue are negotiated \\nbetween the company and the investors. A formal prospectus is not necessary in the case of \\nprivate placement. Underwriting arrangements are also not required in private placement, \\nas the sale is directly negotiated with the investors. This method is useful to small companies \\nand closely held companies for issue of new securities, because such companies are unlikely \\nto get good response from the investing public for their public issues. They can avoid the \\nexpenses of a public issue and also have their shares sold.\\nPrincipal Steps in Floating a Public Issue\\nIn a public issue, investors are allowed to subscribe to the shares being issued by the \\ncompany during a specified period ranging from a minimum of three days to a maximum \\nof ten days. The issue remains open during this period for subscription by the public. This \\nis the principal activity in the process of a public issue. Before the issue is opened for public \\nsubscription, several activities/ legal formalities have to be completed. These are the pre-\\nissue steps or obligations. Similarly, after the issue is closed, several activities are to be \\ncarried out to complete the process of public issue. These activities may be designated as \\nthe post-issue tasks. Thus, we can identify three distinct stages in the successful completion \\nof a public issue.\\n1. Pre-issue tasks\\n2. Opening and closing of the issue\\n3. Post-issue tasks.\\nPre-Issue Tasks\\nThese are the preparatory obligations to be complied with before the actual opening \\nof the issue.\\nDrafting and finalisation of the prospectus Prospectus  is an essential document in \\na public issue. The Companies Act 1956 defines a prospectus as: “ Any document described \\nor issued as a prospectus and includes any notice, circular, advertisement or other document \\ninviting deposits from the public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or \\npurchase of any shares in or debentures of a body corporate” . It is the offer document which \\ncontains all the information pertaining to the company which will be useful to the investors '),\n",

It is a communication \\nfrom the issuer to the investor. The prospectus contains detailed information about the \\ncompany, its activities, promoters, directors, group companies, capital structure, terms of \\nthe present issue, details of proposed project, details regarding underwriting arrangements, \\netc. SEBI has issued guidelines regarding the contents of the prospectus and these have to \\nbe complied with by the company.\\nThe draft prospectus has to be approved by the Board of Directors of the company. \\nThe draft prospectus has also to be filed with SEBI and the Registrar of companies. The \\nfinal prospectus has to be prepared as per the suggestions of SEBI and filed with SEBI and \\nthe Registrar of companies.\\nSelecting the intermediaries and entering into agreements with them  Several \\nintermediaries are involved in the process of a public issue. These intermediaries have to be \\nregistered with SEBI. Important categories of intermediaries are the following:\\n1. Merchant Banker:  Merchant banker is any person or institution which is engaged \\nin the business of issue management either as manager, consultant, adviser, or by \\nrendering corporate advisory service in relation to such issue management. Merchant \\nbankers play an important role in the process of managing a public issue. It is the \\nduty of the merchant bankers to ensure correctness of the information furnished \\nin the prospectus as well as to ensure compliance with SEBI rules, regulations and \\nguidelines regarding public issue of securities. Merchant bankers are registered with \\nSEBI in four categories, with different eligibility criteria for each category.\\n2. Registrar to an Issue:  Registrar to an issue is any person or institution entrusted \\nwith the following functions in connection with a public issue:\\n(a) Collecting applications from investors.\\n(b) Keeping a record of applications and monies received from investors\\n(c) Assisting the stock issuing company in determining the basis of allotment of \\nsecurities in consultation with the stock exchange.\\n(d) Finalising the list of persons entitled to allotment of securities.\\n(e) Processing and despatching allotment letters, refund orders, certificates and \\nother related documents.\\n3. Share Transfer Agent:  Share transfer agent is a person or institution which maintains \\nthe records of holders of securities of a company on behalf of that company. The \\nshare transfer agent is authorised to effect the transfer of securities as well as the \\nredemption of securities wherever applicable.'),\n",

BANKER TO AN ISSUE:  Banker to an issue is a scheduled bank entrusted with the \\nfollowing activities in connection with a public issue:\\n(a) Acceptance of application and application monies\\n(b) Acceptance of allotment or call monies\\n(c) Refund of application monies\\n(d) Payment of dividend or interest warrants.\\nThe intermediaries are service providers possessing professional expertise in the \\nrelevant areas of operation. The market regulator, SEBI, regulates the various intermediaries \\nin the primary market through its regulations for these intermediaries. \\nSEBI has defined the role of each category of intermediary, the eligibility criteria for \\ngranting registration, their functions and responsibilities, and the code of conduct to which \\nthey are bound.\\nThe stock issuing company has to select the intermediaries such as merchant banker, \\nregistrar to the issue, share transfer agent, banker to the issue, underwriters, etc. and sign \\nseparate agreements with each of them to engage them for the public issue.\\nAttending to Other Formalities  \\nThe prospectus and application forms have to be printed and despatched to all \\nintermediaries and brokers for wide circulation among the investing public. An initial \\nlisting application has to be filed with the stock exchange where the issue is proposed to be \\nlisted. An abridged version of the prospectus along with the issue opening and closing dates \\nhas to be published in newspapers.\\nOpening and Closing of The Issue  \\nThe public issue is open for subscription by the public on the pre-announced \\nopening date. The application forms and application monies are received at the branches of \\nthe bankers to the issue and forwarded by these bankers to the Registrar to the issue. Two \\nclosing dates are prescribed for the closing of the public issue. \\nThe first of these is the ‘earliest closing date’ which should not be less than three days \\nfrom the opening date. If sufficient applications are received by the company, the company \\nmay choose to close the issue on the earliest closing date itself. The other closing date is the \\nfinal or latest closing date which shall not exceed ten days from the opening date.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='37\\nPost-Issue Tasks\\nAfter closing of the public issue, several activities are to be carried out to complete \\nthe process of public issue. They are:\\n1. All the application forms received have to be scrutinised, processed and tabulated.\\n2. When the issue is not fully subscribed to, it becomes the liability of the underwriters \\nto subscribe to the shortfall. The liability of each underwriter has to be determined.\\n3. When the issue is oversubscribed, the basis of allotment has to be decided in \\nconsultation with the stock exchange.\\n4. Allotment letters and share certificates have to be despatched to the allottees. Refund \\norders have to be despatched to the applicants whose applications are rejected.\\n5. Shares have to be listed in the stock exchange for trading. For this purpose. the \\nissuing company has to enter into a listing agreement with the stock exchange.\\nBook Building\\nCompanies may raise capital in the primary market by way of public issue, rights \\nissue or private placement. A public issue is the selling of securities to the public in the \\nprimary market. The usual procedure of a public issue is through the fixed price method \\nwhere securities are offered for subscription to the public at a fixed price. An alternative \\nmethod is now available which is known as the book building process. Although book \\nbuilding has been a common practice in most of the developed countries, the concept is \\nrelatively new in India. SEBI announced guidelines for the book building process, for the \\nfirst time, in October 1995.\\nUnder the book building process, the issue price is not fixed in advance. It is \\ndetermined by the offer of potential investors about the price which they are willing to pay \\nfor the issue. The price of the security is determined as the weighted average at which the \\nmajority of investors are willing to buy the security. Thus, under the book building process, \\nthe issue price of a security is determined by the demand and supply forces in the capital \\nmarket.\\nSEBI guidelines define book building as: “ A process undertaken by which a demand \\nfor the securities proposed to be issued by a body corporate is elicited and built up and the \\nprice for such securities is assessed for the determination of the quantum of such securities \\nto be issued by means of a notice, circular, advertisement, document or information \\nmemoranda or offer document” .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='38\\nBook building is a process of price discovery. It puts in place a pricing mechanism \\nwhereby new securities are valued on the basis of the demand feedback following a period \\nof marketing. It is an alternative to the existing system of fixed pricing.\\nA public issue of securities may be made through the fixed price method, the book \\nbuilding method, or a combination of both. In case the issuing company chooses to issue \\nsecurities through the book building route, then as per SEBI guidelines the issuer company \\ncan select any of the following methods:\\n1. 100 per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process.\\n2. Seventy-five per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process \\nand twenty-five per cent through the fixed price method at the price determined \\nthrough book building.\\n3. Ninety per cent of the offer to the public through the book building process and ten \\nper cent through the fixed price method.\\nThe issue of the fixed price portion is conducted like a normal public issue after the \\nbook built portion is issued.\\nThe steps involved in the process of book building may be listed out as follows:\\n1. The issuer appoints a merchant banker as the lead manager and book runner to the \\nissue.\\n2. The book runner forms a syndicate of underwriters. The syndicate consists of book \\nrunner, lead manager, joint lead managers, advisors, co-managers and underwriting \\nmembers.\\n3. A draft prospectus is submitted to SEBI without a price or price band. The draft \\nprospectus is then circulated among eligible investors with a price band arrived at \\nby the book runner in consultation with the issuer. Such a prospectus is known as a \\nRed Herring prospectus.\\n4. The book runner conducts awareness campaigns, which include advertising, road \\nshows and conferences.\\n5. Investors place their orders with syndicate members. These members collect orders \\nfrom their clients on the amount of securities required by them as well as the price \\nthey are willing to pay.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='39\\n6. The book runner builds up a record known as Book after receiving orders from \\nmembers of the syndicate. He maintains detailed records in this regard. The book \\nis thus built up to the size of the portion to be raised through the book building \\nprocess. When the book runner receives substantial number of orders, he announces \\nclosure of the book. A book should remain open for a minimum of three working \\ndays. The maximum period for which the bidding process may be allowed is seven \\nworking days.\\n7. On the basis of the offers received, the book runner and the issuer company then \\ndetermines the price at which the securities shall be sold.\\n8. The book runner finalises the allocation to syndicate members. Procurement \\nagreements are signed between issuer and the syndicate members for the subscription \\nto be procured by them.\\nThe final prospectus along with the procurement agreements is then filed with the \\nRegistrar of companies within two days of the determination of the offer price.\\n9. The book runner collects from the institutional buyers and the underwriters the \\napplication forms along with the application monies to the extent of the securities \\nproposed to be allotted to them/subscribed by them.\\nBook building is a process wherein the issuer of securities asks investors to bid for \\ntheir securities at different prices. These bids should be within an indicative price band \\ndecided by the issuer. Here investors bid for different quantity of shares at different prices. \\nConsidering these bids, issuer determines the price at which the securities are to be allotted. \\nThus, the issuer gets the best possible price for his securities as perceived by the market or \\ninvestors.\\nRole of Primary Market\\nPrimary market is the medium for raising fresh capital in the form of equity and \\ndebt. It mops up resources from the public (investors) and makes them available for meeting \\nthe long-term capital requirements of corporate business and industry. The primary \\nmarket brings together the two principal constituents of the market, namely the investors \\nand the seekers of capital. The savings or surplus funds with the investors are converted \\ninto productive capital to be used by companies for productive purposes. Thus, capital \\nformation takes place in the primary market. The economic growth of a country is possible \\nonly through a robust and vibrant primary market.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='40\\nIn the secondary market, shares already purchased by investors are traded among \\nother investors. Operations in the secondary market do not result in the accretion of capital \\nresources of the country, but indirectly promotes savings and investments by providing \\nliquidity to the investments in securities, i.e. the investors have the facility to liquidate their \\ninvestments in securities in the secondary market.\\nRegulation of Primary Market\\nFor companies, raising capital through the primary market is time consuming and \\nexpensive. The issuer has to engage the services of a number of intermediaries and comply \\nwith complex legal and other formalities. The investor faces much risk while operating \\nin the primary market. Fraudulent promoters may try to dupe the investors who opt to \\ninvest in a new issue. Investors in the primary market need protection from such fraudulent \\noperators.\\nUp to 1992, the primary market was controlled by the Controller of Capital Issues \\n(CCI) appointed under the Capital Issues Control Act, 1947. During that period, the pricing \\nof capital issues was regulated by CCI. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \\nwas formed under the SEBI Act, 1992, with the prime objective of protecting the interests \\nof investors in securities as well as for promoting and regulating the securities market. \\nAll public issues since January 1992 are governed by the rules, regulations and guidelines \\nissued by SEBI.\\nSEBI has been instrumental in bringing greater transparency in capital issues. It \\nhas issued detailed guidelines to standardise disclosure obligations of companies issuing \\nsecurities. Companies floating pubic issues are now required to disclose all relevant \\ninformation affecting investors’ interests. SEBI constantly reviews its guidelines to make \\nthem more market friendly and investor friendly.\\nSuccessful floatation of a new issue in the primary market requires careful planning, \\nproper timing and comprehensive marketing efforts. The services of specialised institutions \\nsuch as merchant bankers, registrars to the issue, underwriters, etc. are available to the \\nissuer company to handle the task. There is effective regulation of SEBI at every stage of a \\npublic issue. There are also regulations to ensure fair practice by the intermediaries in the \\nmarket.\\n****'),\n",

Secondary market is the market in which securities \\nalready issued by companies are subsequently traded among investors. A person with funds \\nfor investment in securities may purchase the securities either in the primary market (from \\nthe issuing company at the time of a new issue of securities) or from the secondary market \\n(from other investors holding the desired securities). Securities can be purchased in the \\nprimary market only at the time of issue of the security by the company, whereas in the \\nsecondary market securities can be purchased throughout the year. As a result, trading \\nin a particular security in the primary market is an intermittent event depending upon \\nthe frequency of new issues of the security by the company, but trading in that security in \\nthe secondary market is continuous. The secondary market where continuous trading in \\nsecurities takes place is the stock exchange. In this chapter we shall examine the functioning \\nof stock exchanges in the country.\\nWhat is a Stock Exchange\\nThe stock exchanges were once physical market places where the agents of \\nbuyers and sellers operated through the auction process. These are being replaced with \\nelectronic exchanges where buyers and sellers are connected only by computers over a \\ntelecommunications network. Auction trading is giving way to “screen-based” trading, \\nwhere bid prices and offer prices (or ask prices) are displayed on the computer screen. Bid \\nprice refers to the price at which an investor is willing to buy the security and offer price \\nrefers to the price at which an investor is willing to sell the security. Alternatively, a dealer \\nin securities may declare the bid price and the offer price of a security, suggesting the price \\nat which he is prepared to buy the security (bid price) and also the price at which he is \\nprepared to sell the security (offer price). The bid-offer spread, the difference between the \\nbid price and the offer price constitutes his margin or profit.\\nSecurities of a company first become available on an exchange after the company \\nconducts its Initial Public Offering (IPO). During the IPO, a company sells it securities \\nto an initial set of investors in the primary market. These securities can then be sold and \\npurchased in the stock exchanges. The exchange tracks the flow of orders for each security, \\nand this flow of supply and demand for the security sets the price of the security.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='42\\nA stock exchange may be defined or described in different ways. A simple description \\nof a stock exchange is as follows: “ A centralised market for buying and selling stocks where \\nthe price is determined through supply-demand mechanisms” .\\nA somewhat similar description of a stock exchange is the following: “ An organisation \\nthat provides a facility for buyers and sellers of listed securities to come together to make \\ntrades in these securities” .\\nIn a stock exchange, the trading in listed securities is carried out by qualified members \\nwho may act either as agents for customers or as principals for their own accounts. \\nStock exchanges may, therefore, be described as “ Associations of brokers and dealers \\nin securities who transact business together” .\\nA more descriptive definition of a stock exchange is: “ An organised market place for \\nsecurities featured by the centralisation of supply and demand for the transaction of orders \\nby member brokers for institutional and individual investors” .\\nAccording to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which is the main law \\ngoverning stock exchanges in India, “stock exchange means any body of individuals, whether \\nincorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or controlling the \\nbusiness of buying, selling or dealing in securities” .\\nFunctions of Stock Exchanges\\nA stock exchange has an important role to fulfil in the economic development of a \\ncountry. It is essential for the smooth functioning of the private sector corporate economy. \\nIn the process of capital formation and in’raising resources for the corporate sector, the \\nstock exchange performs four essential functions.\\nFirstly, it provides a market place for purchase and sale of securities such as shares, \\nbonds, debentures, etc. Investors desirous of buying securities would be able to buy securities \\nin the primary market only occasionally, that is, at the time of issue of such securities by the \\ncompany, whereas they would be able to buy securities in the stock exchanges at any time, \\nas trading in stock exchanges is continuous. Similarly, holders of securities who are desirous \\nof selling the securities would be able to sell them only in the stock exchanges, as the issuing \\ncompanies do not ordinarily buy back the shares. Thus, stock exchanges provide the facility \\nfor continuous trading in securities.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='43\\nSecondly, stock exchanges provide liquidity to the investments in securities, that \\nis, it gives the investors a place to liquidate their holdings. This is essentially the basis for \\nthe joint stock enterprise system. Investors would not be interested to invest in corporate \\nsecurities without the assurance provided by the stock exchanges to the owners of corporate \\nsecurities that these securities can be sold in the stock exchanges at any time.\\nThirdly, the stock exchanges help in the valuation of securities by providing the \\nmarket quotations of the prices of securities. The market quotations represent the collective \\njudgement on the value of the securities arrived at simultaneously by many sellers and \\nbuyers in the market. The value of shares is influenced by macro economic factors as well \\nas micro economic factors, long-term economic trends as well as short-term fluctuations \\nin economic variables. Speculative forces in the securities market also influence share \\nvaluations. Market quotations of share prices provide valuable information to prospective \\ninvestors as well as shareholders regarding the value of shares traded in the stock exchanges.\\nFourthly, stock exchanges play the role of a barometer, namely, an indicator of the \\nstate of health of the nation’s economy as a whole. The shares of a large number of companies \\nare listed for trading in the important stock exchanges of the country. The market quotations \\nof individual shares represent their current valuation. The trend of price movements in the \\nmarket is indicated by calculating stock market indices which represent the weighted average \\nof prices of selected shares representing all the important industries. These stock market \\nindices are used to represent the share market as a whole. Their movements and levels are \\nindicative of the economic health of the nation to a great extent because movements of \\nprices of shares are influenced by macro economic factors such as growth of GDP , financial \\nand monetary policies, tax changes, political environment, etc.\\nThe stock exchanges provide the linkage between the savings in the household sector \\nand the investments in the corporate sector. They indirectly help in mobilising savings and \\nchannelising them into the corporate sector as securities.\\nStock Market in India\\nThe Indian securities market has become one of the most dynamic and efficient \\nsecurities market in Asia today. The Indian market now conforms to international standards \\nin terms of operating efficiency. In this context, it would be informative to understand the \\norigin and growth of the Indian stock market.\\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, shares of companies used to be floated in \\nIndia occasionally. There were share brokers in Bombay who assisted in the floatation of '),\n",

A small group of stock brokers in Bombay joined together in 1875 to \\nform an association called Native Share and Stockbrokers Association. The association drew \\nup codes of conduct for brokerage business and mobilised private funds for investment in \\nthe corporate sector. It was this association which later became the Bombay Stock Exchange, \\nwhich is the oldest stock exchange in Asia. This exchange is now known as The Stock \\nExchange, Mumbai, or BSE.\\nAhmedabad was a major centre of cotton textile industry. After 1880, many new cotton \\ntextile mills were started in and around Ahmedabad. As new cotton textile enterprises were \\nfloated, the need for a stock exchange at Ahmedabad was strongly felt. Accordingly, in 1894, \\nthe brokers of Ahmedabad formed The Ahmedabad Share and Stockbrokers Association, \\nwhich later became the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange, the second stock exchange of the \\ncountry.\\nDuring the 1900s Kolkata became another major centre of share trading on account \\nof the starting of several indigenous industrial enterprises. As a result, the third stock \\nexchange of the country was started by the Kolkata stockbrokers at Kolkata in 1908. As \\nindustrial activity in the country gained momentum, existing enterprises in cotton textiles, \\nwoollen textiles, tea, sugar, paper, steel, engineering goods, etc. began to undertake \\nexpansion activities and new ventures were also floated. Y et another stock exchange was \\nstarted in 1920 at Chennai. However, by 1923, it ceased to exist. Later, in 1937, the Madras \\nStock Exchange was revived as many new cotton textile mills and plantation companies were \\nfloated in South India. Three more stock exchanges were established before independence, \\nat Indore in Madhya Pradesh in 1930, at Hyderabad in 1943 and at Delhi in 1947. Thus, at \\nthe time of independence, seven stock exchanges were functioning in the major cities of the \\ncountry.\\nThe number of stock exchanges virtually remained unchanged for nearly three \\ndecades from 1947 to 1977, except for the establishment of the Bangalore Stock Exchange \\nin 1957. During the 1980s, however, many stock exchanges were established. \\nSome of them were:\\n1. Cochin Stock Exchange (1978)\\n2. Uttar Pradesh Stock Exchange (at Kanpur, 1982)\\n3. Pune Stock Exchange (1982)\\n4. Ludhiana Stock Exchange (1983)\\n5. Gauhati Stock Exchange (1984)'),\n",

Vadodara Stock Exchange (at Baroda, 1990).\\nThus, from seven stock exchanges in 1947, the number of stock exchanges in the \\ncountry increased to eighteen by 1990. Along with the increase in the number of stock \\nexchanges, the number of listed companies and the capital of the listed companies has also \\ngrown, especially after 1985. Two more stock exchanges were set up at Coimbatore and \\nMeerut during the 1990s, taking the total to twenty.\\nOver the Counter Exchange of India ( OTCEI )\\nThe traditional trading mechanism (floor trading using open outcry system), which \\nprevailed in the Indian stock exchanges, resulted in much functional inefficiency such \\nas absence of liquidity, lack of transparency, undue delay in settlement of transactions, \\nfraudulent practices, etc. With the objective of providing more efficient services to investors, \\nthe country’s first electronic stock exchange which facilitates ringless, scripless trading \\nwas set up in 1992 with the name Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI). It was \\nsponsored by the country’s premier financial institutions such as UTI, ICICI, IDBI, SBI \\nCapital Markets, IFCI, GIC and its subsidiaries and Canbank Financial services.\\nThe exchange was set up to aid enterprising promoters in raising finance for new \\nprojects in a cost effective manner and to provide investors with a transparent and efficient \\nmodel of trading. The OTCEI had many novel features. It introduced screen based trading \\nfor the first time in the Indian stock market. Trading takes place through a network of \\ncomputers of over the counter (OTC) dealers located at several places, linked to a central \\nOTC computer using telecommunication links. All the activities of the OTC trading process \\nare fully computerised. \\nMoreover, OTCEI is a national exchange having a country-wide reach. OTCEI has \\nan exclusive listing of companies, that is, it does not ordinarily list and trade in companies \\nlisted in any other stock exchanges. For being listed in OTCEI the companies have to be \\nsponsored by members of OTCEI. It was the first exchange in the country to introduce \\nthe practice of market making, that is, dealers in securities providing two-way quotes (bid \\nprices and offer prices of securities).'),\n",

The \\nhigh powered committee on stock exchanges known as Pherwani Committee recommended, \\nin 1991, the setting up of a new stock exchange as a model exchange and to function as \\na national stock exchange. It was envisaged that the new exchange should be completely \\nautomated in terms of both trading and settlement procedures. \\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the Pherwani committee, a new stock \\nexchange was promoted by the premier financial institutions of the country, namely 1DB!, \\nICICI, IFCI, all insurance corporations, selected commercial banks and others. The new \\nexchange was incorporated in 1992 as the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It started \\nfunctioning in June 1994.\\nThe purpose of setting up the new exchange was to create a world-class exchange \\nand use it as an instrument of change in the Indian stock market through competitive \\npressure. Technology has been the backbone of NSE. It chose to harness technology in \\ncreating a new market design. Its trading system, called National Exchange for Automated \\nTrading (NEAT), is a state-of-the-art client-server based application. The NSE also uses \\nsatellite communication technology for trading. Its trading system has shifted the trading \\nplatform from the trading hall in the premises of the exchange to the computer terminals \\nat the premises of the trading members located at different geographical locations in the \\ncountry. It has been instrumental in bringing about many changes in the trading system \\nsuch as reduction of settlement cycle, dematerialisation and electronic transfer of securities, \\nestablishment of clearing corporations, professionalisation of trading members, etc.\\nAll the stock exchanges in the country, starting with the Bombay Stock Exchange, \\nhave shifted to the new computerised trading system which facilitates screen-based trading. \\nAs a consequence, the stock market today uses the state-of-the-art information technology \\ntools to provide an efficient and transparent trading, clearing and settlement mechanism \\nat par with international standards. The National Stock Exchange has played a leading role \\nas a change agent in transforming the Indian stock market to its present form. Since its \\ninception, the NSE has been playing the role of a catalytic agent in reforming the stock \\nmarket and evolving the best market practices. The NSE has brought about unparalleled \\ntransparency, speed and efficiency, safety and market integrity. In this process the NSE has \\nbecome the largest stock exchange in the country, relegating the Bombay Stock Exchange \\nto the second place.'),\n",

Automated screen-based trading, rolling settlement \\non T + 2 cycle, dematerialisation of securities with electronic transfer of securities, etc. \\ncompletely transformed the market structures and procedures. Gradually, the two national \\nstock exchanges, BSE and NSE dominated the scene with practically all trading being routed \\nthrough either of these exchanges. The regional stock exchanges became irrelevant as they \\ncould not compete with the breadth and depth of these two stock exchanges, and there was \\nvirtually no trading at any of the nineteen regional centres. \\nThe members of the regional stock exchanges of the country started investing large \\namounts of money in automating their trading, clearing and settlement systems on account \\nof regulatory compulsions. This situation prompted the regional stock exchanges to devise \\nsome way of reviving their fortunes. It was decided to evolve an ipter-connected market \\nsystem by pooling the resources of the regional stock exchanges. Fourteen regional stock \\nexchanges (excluding Calcutta, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Ludhiana and Pune stock exchanges) \\njoined together and promoted a new organisation called Inter-connected Stock Exchange \\nof India Ltd. (ISE) in 1998. The ISE was recognised as a stock exchange by SEBI and it \\ncommenced trading in February, 1999. It then began to function as a national level stock \\nexchange.\\nThe objective of setting up ISE was to optimally utilise the existing infrastructure \\nand other resources of participating stock exchanges which were until now underutilised. \\nThe ISE aims to provide cost-effective trading linkage/ connectivity to all the members of \\nthe participating exchanges on a national level. This will help to widen the market for the \\nsecurities listed on the regional stock exchanges. \\nThrough ISE an attempt is made to make the regional markets vibrant and liquid \\nthrough the use of the state of the art technology and networking. The trading settlement \\nand funds transfer operations of the ISE are completely automated. However, ISE has not \\nsucceeded in becoming a competitive market force to BSE and NSE. This is mainly because \\nthe participating regional stock exchanges did not close down their regional segments.\\nAt present there are twenty-three stock exchanges in the country. Four of them can \\nbe considered as national level exchanges, namely, NSE, BSE, OTCEI and ISE; the remaining \\nnineteen are regional stock exchanges (RSEs) located in important cities of the country. But \\nit may be noted that most of the trading in securities in the country are transacted through \\nthe two largest stock exchanges, namely the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Stock '),\n",

Even in these \\nexchanges, even though there are a large number of companies listed, active daily trading \\ntakes place only in the securities of a limited number of companies. The large volume of \\ntrading is accounted for by limited number of securities. For the vast majority of securities \\nof listed companies, the stock exchanges fail to provide liquidity.\\nOrganisation, Membership and Management of Stock Exchanges\\nBasically, a stock exchange is an organised market for trading securities. It is also \\ncalled a bourse. It is an association or organisation of individuals which is governed by \\ncertain rules and regulations. The manner of organisation and the rules of membership are \\nimportant features of stock exchanges as also the governance system of the organisation.\\nOver the years, stock exchanges in the country have been organised in various forms \\nsuch as voluntary non-profit making association, public limited company and company \\nlimited by guarantee. In India, the earliest stock exchanges were organised as voluntary \\nnon-profit making associations of persons. Later on, stock exchanges began to be organised \\nas companies.\\nThe membership of stock exchanges initially comprised of individuals and \\npartnership firms. It was the stock brokers who became members of stock exchanges either \\nin their individual capacity or by forming partnership firms. Later on companies were also \\nallowed to become members of stock exchanges. Thus, stock exchanges now have both \\nindividual and institutional membership. Membership in stock exchanges is restricted \\nand limited. It is acquired by paying the prescribed entrance fee/share value. Members are \\nalso supposed to make security deposit and pay annual subscription to the exchange. The \\nquantum of entrance fee/share value, security deposit and annual subscription vary from \\nexchange to exchange.\\nThe management of each stock exchange is vested in a Governing Board which is \\nthe apex body deciding the policies of the exchange as also regulating the affairs of the \\nexchange. The composition of the governing board is of a heterogeneous nature. It usually \\nconsists of elected directors (mostly from the broking community), SEBI nominees and \\npublic representatives. The governing board is usually presided over by an executive director \\nor president. The executive director/ president as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the \\nexchange is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the exchange. The governing \\nboard may constitute executive committees of its members to supervise and monitor specific \\nfunctions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='49\\nThe BSE governing board has twenty members consisting of nine elected directors, \\nthree SEBI nominees, six public representatives, an executive director (CEO), and a non- \\nexecutive chairman. The governing board of the National Stock Exchange comprises senior \\nexecutives from promoter institutions, eminent professionals in the fields of law, economics, \\naccountancy, finance, taxation, etc., public representatives, nominees of SEBI and one full- \\ntime executive of the exchange.\\nThe governing board of an exchange has wide powers for the management and \\nadministration of the stock exchange concerned. These powers include wide ranging \\ndiscretionary powers also. \\nThe important powers of the governing body are:\\n1. Manage and control the functioning of the exchange.\\n2. Regulate trading in securities.\\n3. Admit, fine, suspend or expel members and take such disciplinary action as it deems \\nfit.\\n4. Settle disputes, if any, amongst the members and between members and nonmembers.\\n5. Make or amend any rules, by-laws or regulations or suspend their operations with \\nthe approval of the government.\\n6. Interpret the rules, by-laws and regulations. The stock exchanges have to comply \\nwith the directions of the SEBI.\\nListing of Securities\\nFor the securities of a company to be traded on a stock exchange, they have to be \\nlisted in that stock exchange. Listing is the process of including the securities of a company \\nin the official list of the stock exchange for the purpose of trading.\\nAt the time of issue of securities, a company has to apply for listing the securities \\nin a recognised stock exchange. The Securities Contracts Regulation Act and rules, SERI \\nguidelines, and the rules and regulations of the exchange prescribe the statutory requirements \\nto be fulfilled by a company for getting its shares listed in a stock exchange. Important \\ndocuments such as memorandum of association, articles of association, prospectus, directors’ \\nreport, annual accounts, agreement with underwriters, etc. and detailed information about \\nthe company’s activities, its capital structure, distribution of shares, dividends and bonus \\nshares issued, etc. have to be submitted to the stock exchange along with the application for \\nlisting.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='50\\nThe stock exchange examines whether the company satisfies the criteria prescribed \\nfor listing. When the stock exchange finds that a company is eligible for listing its securities \\nat the exchange, the company would be required to execute a listing agreement with the \\nstock exchange. This listing agreement contains the obligations and restrictions imposed \\non the company as a result of listing. The company is also required to pay the annual listing \\nfees every year.\\nThe purpose of the listing agreement is to compel the company to keep the \\nshareholders and investors informed about the various activities which are likely to affect \\nthe share prices of the company. A company whose securities are listed in a stock exchange \\nis obliged to keep the stock exchange fully informed about all matters affecting the company. \\nMoreover, the company has to forward copies of its audited annual accounts to the stock \\nexchange as soon-as they are issued.\\nThe securities of companies listed on a stock exchange may be classified into different \\ngroups. For instance, the securities listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have been \\nclassified into A, B1, B2, F , G and Z groups. The equity shares listed in the exchange have \\nbeen grouped under three groups, namely A, BI and B2, based on certain qualitative and \\nquantitative parameters which include number of trades, value traded, etc. The F group \\nrepresents the fixed income securities. The G group includes Government securities for \\nretail investors. The Z group includes companies which have failed to comply with the \\nlisting requirements of the exchange or have failed to resolve investor complaints or have \\nnot made arrangements with the depositories for dematerialisation of their securities.\\nPermitted Securities\\nThe securities of companies which have signed listing agreement with an exchange \\nare traded at the exchange as listed securities. A stock exchange sometimes permits trading \\nin certain securities which are not listed at the exchange but are actively traded in other \\nstock exchanges. Such securities are known as permitted securities. This facility is provided \\nto help market participants to trade in certain actively traded securities even though they \\nare not formally listed at the exchange. Thus, a stock exchange may have certain listed \\nsecurities and certain permitted securities, and trading may take place in these securities \\nregularly.\\nRegulation of Stock Exchanges\\nThe stock exchanges play a very vital and sensitive role in the functioning of the \\neconomy, especially the private sector of the economy. The functioning of the exchanges, '),\n",

This is ensured through proper \\nregulation of the working of stock exchanges. There are Acts, rules, regulations, by-laws \\nand guidelines governing the functioning of secondary markets or stock exchanges in the \\ncountry. There is also a regulator in the form of the Securities and Exchange Board of \\nIndia (SEBI) to oversee and monitor the functioning of both the primary and secondary \\nsecurities markets in India.\\nThe Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, and the rules made under the \\nAct, namely the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, constitute the main laws \\ngoverning stock exchanges in India. The preamble to the Act states that it is “an act to \\nprevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business of dealing therein” . \\nThis Act provides for the direct and indirect control of virtually all aspects of securities \\ntrading and the functioning of stock exchanges.\\nThe provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, were formerly \\nadministered by the Central Government. However, since the enactment of the Securities \\nand Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the Board established under this Act has been \\nauthorised to administer almost all the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) \\nAct. The various provisions of the Act deal with recognition of stock exchanges, submission \\nof relevant documents, approval of by-laws and rules made by stock exchanges, listing of \\nsecurities in stock exchanges and such other matters relating to the trading of securities and \\nthe functioning of stock exchanges.\\nTaking into consideration the fact that the securities market in India had shown \\ntremendous growth, the government decided to set up a separate board for the regulation \\nand orderly functioning of the securities market in the country, in the model of the Securities \\nand Investment Board (SIB) of UK and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of \\nUSA.\\nInitially, the Securities and Exchange Board of India was constituted as an interim \\nadministrative body in 1988. SEBI was given a statutory status on 30th January 1992 by an \\nordinance to provide for the establishment of SEBI. Later, in April 1992, the Securities and \\nExchange Board of India Act was passed. In this Act it is stipulated that it shall be the duty \\nof the Board to protect the interests of investors in the securities market and to promote the \\ndevelopment of and to regulate the securities market.\\nThus, the SEBI has been constituted to promote orderly and healthy development \\nof the securities market and to ensure adequate protection to the investors in the securities \\nmarket. The Board plays a dual role, namely a regulatory role and a developmental role.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='52\\nThe SEBI is constituted with six members, including the chairman of the Board. \\nTwo members are officials of the central government ministries of Finance and Law, one \\nmember is an official of the Reserve Bank of India and two members are professionals having \\nexperience or special knowledge relating to securities markets and are appointed by the \\ncentral government. The Board is empowered to regulate the business in stock exchanges, \\nto register and regulate the working of stock market intermediaries such as stock brokers, \\nsub-brokers, share transfer agents, bankers to an issue, trustees of trust deeds, registrars to \\nan issue, merchant bankers, underwriters, etc. \\nThe Board is also authorised to prevent and prohibit fraudulent and unfair trade \\npractices in the market. It makes regulations and issues guidelines regarding the various \\naspects of the working of stock exchanges, and constantly monitors the activities in the \\nsecurities market to ensure just and fair dealings. Transparency and equal opportunity to \\nall market participants have been the goals of all developmental and regulatory activities of \\nSEBI.\\nA stock exchange has the power to make by-laws for the regulation and control of \\ncontracts entered into by members and also for the regulation of trading in the exchange. \\nHowever, these by-laws have to be approved by SEBI before implementation. Amendments \\nto the by-laws should also be similarly approved.\\nThe Depositories Act, 1996, is another important legislation affecting the functioning \\nof stock exchanges. This Act provides for the setting up of depositories for electronic \\nrecording and transfer of securities. The paper-based securities and their transfer often \\nresulted in delay in the settlement and transfer of securities and also led to bad delivery, \\ntheft, forgery, etc. The Depositories Act, 1996, was passed to change over to the electronic \\nmode of security transfer through security depositories so as to improve the efficiency of \\nthe system.\\nThe securities market in India is properly regulated to ensure that it functions \\nefficiently and effectively. There are strict laws governing the functioning of stock exchanges; \\nthere is a vigilant regulator who oversees the implementation of these laws. As a result, \\ninvestors now have confidence in the efficiency and robustness of the Indian stock market.\\nTrading System in Stock Exchange\\nA stock exchange is a market for trading in securities. But it is not an ordinary market; \\nit is a market with several peculiar features. In a stock exchange, buyers and sellers do not \\ndirectly meet and interact with each other for making their trades. The investors (buyers '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='53\\nand sellers of securities) trade through brokers who are members of a stock exchange. In \\nstock exchanges, trading procedures are fully automated and member brokers interact and \\ntrade through a networked computer system. Trading in a stock exchange takes place in two \\nphases; in the first phase, the member brokers execute their buy or sell orders on behalf of \\ntheir clients (or investors) and, in the second phase, the securities and cash are exchanged. \\nFor the exchange of securities and cash between the traders, the services of two other \\nagencies are required, namely the clearing house (corporation) of the stock exchange and \\nthe depositories. Further, unlike other ordinary markets, stock exchanges are markets where \\nthe prices of the items traded (namely, securities) fluctuate constantly. This fluctuation in \\nsecurity prices leads to speculative activities in the stock exchanges.\\nWe need to understand clearly the trading system in stockexchanges, how the trades \\nare settled through exchange of securities and cash, the role of the clearing corporation and \\nthe depositories, etc. We also need to understand the different types of speculative activities \\ntaking place in a stock exchange. The information about the prices of securities traded in a \\nstock exchange is useful in understanding the behaviour of the stock markets.\\nTrading System\\nThe system of trading prevailing in stock exchanges for many years was known as \\nfloor trading. In this system, trading took place through an open outcry system on the \\ntrading floor or ring of the exchange during official trading hours.\\nIn floor trading , buyers and sellers transact business face to face using a variety \\nof signals. Under this system, an investor desirous of buying a security gets in touch with \\na broker and places a buy order along with the money to buy the security. Similarly, an \\ninvestor intending to sell a security gets in touch with a broker, places a sell order and hands \\nover the share certificate to be sold. \\nAfter the completion of a transaction at the trading floor between the brokers acting \\non behalf of the investors, the buyer investor would receive the share certificate and the \\nseller investor would receive the cash through their respective brokers.\\nIn the new electronic stock exchanges, which have a fully automated computerised \\nmode of trading, floor trading is replaced with a new system of trading known as screen- \\nbased trading. In this new system, the trading ring is replaced by the computer screen \\nand distant participants can trade with each other through the computer network. The \\nmember brokers can install trading terminals at any place in the country. A large number '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='54\\nof participants, geographically separated from each other, can trade simultaneously at high \\nspeeds from their respective locations. The screen-based trading systems are of two types\\n1. Quote driven system\\n2. Order driven system.\\nUnder the quote driven system, the market-maker, who is the dealer in a particular \\nsecurity, inputs two-way quotes into the system, that is, his bid price (buying price) and \\noffer price (selling price). The market participants then place their orders based on the bid- \\noffer quotes. These are then automatically matched by the system according to certain rules.\\nUnder the order driven system, clients place their buy and sell orders with the brokers. \\nThese are then fed into the system. The buy and sell orders are automatically matched by the \\nsystem according to predetermined rules.\\nTypes of Orders\\nAn investor can have his buy or sell orders executed either at the best price prevailing \\non the exchange or at a price that he determines. Accordingly, an investor may place two \\ntypes of orders, namely, market order or limit order.\\nMarket Orders \\nIn a market order, the broker is instructed by the investor to buy or sell a stated \\nnumber of shares immediately at the best prevailing price in the market. In the case of a buy \\norder, the best price is the lowest price obtainable; in the case of a sell order, it is the highest \\nprice obtainable. When placing a market order, the investor can be fairly certain that the \\norder will be executed, but he will be uncertain of the price until after the order is executed.\\nLimit Orders \\nWhile placing a limit order, the investor specifies in advance the limit price at which \\nhe wants the transaction to be carried out. In the case of a limit order to buy, the investor \\nspecifies the maximum price that he will pay for the share; the order has to be executed \\nonly at the limit price or a lower price. In the case of a limit order to sell shares, the investor \\nspecifies the minimum price he will accept for the share and hence, the order has to be \\nexecuted only at the limit price or a price higher to it. Thus for limit orders to purchase \\nshares the investor specifies a ceiling on the price, and for limit orders to sell shares the \\ninvestor specifies a floor price.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='55\\nLimit orders are generally placed “away from the market” which means that the limit \\nprice is somewhat removed from the prevailing market price. In the case of a limit order \\nto buy, the limit price would be below the prevailing price and in the case of a limit order \\nto sell, the limit price would be above the prevailing market price. The investor placing \\nlimit orders believes that his limit price will be reached and the order executed within a \\nreasonable period of time. But the limit order may remain unexecuted.\\nThere are certain special types of orders which may be used by investors to protect \\ntheir profits or limit their losses. Two such special kinds of orders are stop orders (also \\nknown as stop loss orders) and stop limit orders.\\nStop Orders \\nA stop order may be used by an investor to protect a profit or limit a loss. For a stop \\norder, the investor must specify what is known as a stop price. If it is a sell order, the stop \\nprice must be below the market price prevailing at the time the order is placed. If it is a buy \\norder, the stop price must be above the market price prevailing at the time of placing the \\norder. If, subsequently, the market price reaches or passes the stop price, the stop order will \\nbe executed at the best available price. Thus, a stop order can be viewed as a conditional \\nmarket order, because it becomes a market order when the market price reaches or passes \\nthe stop price.\\nExamples will help to clarify the working of stop orders. Suppose an investor has \\n100 shares of a company which were purchased at ` 35 per share. The current market price \\nof the share is ` 75. The investor thus has earned a profit of ` 40 per share on his share \\nholdings. He would very much like to protect this profit without foregoing the opportunity \\nof earning more profit if the price moves still upwards. This can be achieved by placing a \\nstop sell order at a price below the, current market price of ` 75, for example at ` 70. Now, \\nif the price subsequently falls to ` 70 or below, the stop sell order becomes a market order \\nand it will be executed at the best price prevailing in the market. Thus, the investor will be \\nable to protect the profit of around ` 35 per share. On the contrary, if the market price of \\nthe share moves upwards, the stop sell order will not be executed and the investor retains \\nthe opportunity of earning higher profits on his holding.\\nStop orders can also be used to minimise loss in trading. Suppose that a share is \\ncurrently selling for ` 125 and an investor expects a fall in the price of the share. He may \\nplace an order for sale of the share at the current market price of ` 125 hoping to cover up \\nhis position by purchasing the share at a lower price and thus make a profit on the deal. This \\ntype of a transaction is known as a short sale. If price of the share falls as anticipated by the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content='56\\ninvestor, he would make a profit. There is a possibility that the price may move upwards \\nand in that case the investor has to purchase the share at a higher price to cover up his \\nposition and meet his sales commitment. This will result in a loss to the investor. This loss \\ncan be minimised by placing a stop buy order at a price above the current price of ` 125, for \\nexample at ` 130. \\nNow, if the price of the share rises to ` 130 or above, the stop buy order will become \\na market order and will be executed at the best price available in the market. Suppose that \\nthe stop buy order was executed at ` 131, then the loss of the investor is limited to ` 6 per \\nshare, that is, the difference between the selling price of ` 125 and the buying price of ` 131 \\nper share.\\nOne disadvantage of the stop orders is that the actual price at which the order is \\nexecuted is uncertain and may be some distance away from the stop price.\\nStop Limit Orders \\nThe stop limit order is a special type of order designed to overcome the uncertainty \\nof the execution price associated with a stop order. The stop limit order gives the investor \\nthe opportunity of specifying a limit price for executing the stop orders: the maximum price \\nfor a stop buy order and the minimum price for a stop sell order. With a stop limit order, the \\ninvestor specifies two prices, a stop price and a limit price. When the market price reaches \\nor passes the stop price, the stop limit order becomes a limit order to be executed within the \\nlimit price. Hence, a stop limit order can be viewed as a conditional limit order.\\nLet us consider two examples. Consider a share that is currently selling at ` 60. An \\ninvestor who holds the share may place a stop limit order to sell with stop price of ` 55 and \\nlimit price of ` 52. If the market price declines to ` 55 or lower, a limit order to sell the share \\nat the limit price of ` 52 or higher would be activated. Here the order will be executed only \\nif the share is available at ` 52 or above. Thus a stop limit order may remain unexecuted.\\nConsider an investor who desires to make a short sale of a particular share at its \\ncurrent market price of ` 85. That is, he intends to sell the share without owning it but \\nhoping to buy it later from the market at a lower price. He may also place a stop limit order \\nto buy the share to minimise his loss in case the share price moves upwards contrary to his \\nexpectations. He may specify a stop price of ` 90 and a limit price of ` 93 for his stop limit \\norder to buy. If the price moves up to ` 90 or above, then a limit order to buy the share with \\nlimit price of ` 93 would be activated.

The stop \\norder results in certain execution at an uncertain price, while a stop limit order results in \\nuncertain execution within a specified price limit.\\nTrading in stock exchanges takes place continuously during the official trading hours. \\nStock exchanges are open five days a week, from Monday through Friday. An investor may \\nplace orders for trade through his broker at any time during the official trading hours, but \\nhe needs to specify the time limit for the validity of the order. The time limit on an order is \\nessentially an instruction to the broker about the time within which he should attempt to \\nexecute the order.\\nDay Orders A day order is an order that is valid only for the trading day on which the \\norder is placed. If the order is not executed by the end of the day, it is treated as cancelled. \\nAll orders are ordinarily treated as day orders unless specified as other types of orders.\\nWeek Orders These are orders that are valid till the end of the week during which \\nthe orders are placed. They expire at the close of the trading session on Friday of the week, \\nunless they are executed by then.\\nMonth Orders These are orders that are valid till the end of the month during which \\nthe orders are placed. Month orders expire at the close of the trading session on the last \\nworking day of the month.\\nOpen Orders Open orders are orders that remain valid till they are executed by the \\nbrokers or specifically cancelled by the investor. They are also known as good till cancelled \\norders or GTC orders. However, brokers generally seek periodic confirmation of open \\norders from the investors.\\nFill or Kill Orders These orders are also known as FoK orders. These orders are \\nmeant to be executed immediately. If not executed immediately, they are to be treated as \\ncancelled.\\nSettlement\\nTrading in stock exchanges is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the \\nexecution of the orders submitted by clients takes place between brokers acting on behalf of \\nthe clients or investors. Buy orders are matched with sell orders. In the automated system, \\ntrading is carried out in an anonymous environment and the orders are matched by the \\ncomputer system.'),\n",

This process of transfer of security and cash is done in the second phase which is \\nknown as the settlement of the trade. The settlement process involving delivery of securities \\nand payment of cash is carried out through a separate agency known as the clearing house \\nwhich functions in each stock exchange. The clearing house acts as the counter party for \\neach trade. Member-brokers who sell securities have to deliver the securities to the clearing \\nhouse and will receive cash from the clearing house. Similarly, the member- brokers \\nwho buy securities will have to pay cash to the clearing house and receive the securities \\nfrom the clearing house. The stock exchanges now follow a settlement procedure known \\nas Compulsory Rolling Settlement (CRS) as mandated by SEBI. The earlier procedure of \\nsettlement was “account period settlement” wherein all trades carried out or executed \\nduring an account period of a week or fortnight were settled on the last day of the account \\nperiod. The account period used to vary from exchange to exchange.\\nUnder the rolling settlement system, the trades executed on a particular day are \\nsettled after a specified number of business days or working days. Initially, a T + 5 settle -\\nment cycle was introduced, which was subsequently reduced to a T + 3 cycle. Currently, a \\nT + 2 settlement cycle is adopted by the stock exchanges. This means that the settlement \\nof transactions done on T, that is, the trade day, has to be done on the second business day \\nafter the trade day. The pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities has to take place on the \\nsecond business day after the day of trade. For example, for an order executed on Tuesday of \\na week, the settlement (delivery of security and payment of cash) has to be done on Thurs -\\nday. The pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities are marked through the clearing house.\\nOn the first business day (T + 1) after the trade day (T), the exchange generates \\ndelivery and receive orders for transactions done by member-brokers. These provide the \\nrelevant information regarding the securities to be delivered /received by the member- \\nbrokers through the clearing house. Similarly, a money statement showing the details of \\npayments/ receipts of monies by the member-brokers is also prepared by the exchange. The \\nDelivery/ Receive orders and the Money Statement can be downloaded by the member- \\nbrokers.\\nOn the second business day (T + 2) after the day of trade, the member-brokers are \\nrequired to submit the pay-in instructions to the depositories for transfer of securities to \\nthe clearing house in the case of demat securities. In the case of securities in physical form, \\nthe certificates have to be delivered to the clearing house. For pay-in of funds by member- \\nbrokers, the bank accounts of member-brokers maintained with the authorised clearing \\nbanks are directly debited through the computerised system.'),\n",

A person may be interested in getting a good rate of return, earned \\non a rather consistent basis, for a relatively long period of time. For this he will choose the \\nshares of a company which is fundamentally strong and has the potential for growth in the \\nfuture. \\nSuch a person is a genuine investor who invests his money in securities for long-term \\nreturns. There may be other persons who have a short-term perspective on their trading \\nactivities on the stock exchanges. A person may be interested in making a quick short-term \\nprofit from the fluctuations in the prices of securities in the stock market. Such a person is \\nknown as a speculator. Speculators are traders who intend to make high returns within a \\nshort span of time, making use of the short-term fluctuations in security prices.\\nSpeculators constantly monitor the movement of share prices in the market. On the \\nbasis of their analysis of share price movements and on the basis of the evaluation of various \\ninformation regarding the performance of companies, the speculative traders speculate on \\nthe future course of prices. They believe that mispricing of securities occurs periodically \\nin the market. Sometimes, some securities may be overpriced (that is, their price may be \\nhigher than their intrinsic value) and at other times some securities may be underpriced. \\nSpeculators attempt to exploit such mispricing of securities, because it is presumed that the \\nmispricing would be corrected by the market eventually.'),\n",

The \\nspeculator in this case is said to take a long position with respect to that security. He is not \\ninterested in taking delivery of the security, but intends to sell it off as quickly as possible to \\ngain some profit. Hence, he would not like to hold his long position for an extended period. \\nHe would like the mispricing to be corrected at the earliest, preferably, on the same day. \\nSuch kind of a speculative activity is known as long buy.\\nShort Sale\\nOn the contrary, if a speculator estimates that a security is overpriced and its price \\nis likely to decline shortly, he would like to sell the security at the current price and buy \\nit sometime later when the price declines so as to deliver the security sold at the time \\nof settlement of the trade. Ordinarily, a person sells securities which he owns. Here, the \\nspeculator is selling a security which he does not own or possess in the hope that he would \\nbe able to deliver the security on the due date ‘by buying it at a lower price within a short \\nperiod of time. He hopes to gain some profit in the transaction. The speculator in this case \\nis taking a “short position” with respect to the security by engaging in a ‘short sale’ . \\nFundamentally, a short sale is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller \\nat the time of the transaction. A short seller has to cover up his position or eliminate the \\ndeficiency by buying the security sometime in the near future. He will be able to make a \\nprofit out of the short sale transaction only if he is able to buy the security at a lower price. \\nIf the price of a security moves up against his anticipations, he will suffer a loss.\\nSpeculation involves high amount of risk. The speculators take long or short \\npositions on the basis of their estimation or speculation about the future movement of \\nprices. If the prices of securities do not move in the expected directions within a short time, \\nthe speculators suffer losses.\\nTypes of Speculators\\nTraders engaged in speculative activity in the stock market are described by different \\nnames based on the type of activity they generally engage in. The prominent among them \\nare hulls, bears, stag and lame duck.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='61\\nBull\\nA trader who expects a rise in prices of securities is known as a bull. He, therefore, \\ntakes a long position with respect to securities. He engages in long buy anticipating a rise in \\nprices of securities. The bulls will be able to make profit only if the prices rise as anticipated; \\notherwise they will suffer losses. When there is an overbought condition in the market, that \\nis, the purchases made by speculators exceed the sales made by them; the bulls begin to \\nspread good rumours about companies so as to raise the price of their shares. This activity \\nis called a bull campaign.\\nWhen the prices of securities are generally rising in the market, resulting in buoyancy \\nand optimism in the stock market, the market is said to be in a bullish phase.\\nBear\\nA bear is a pessimist who expects a decline in the prices of securities. He, therefore, \\ntakes a ‘short position’ on securities by engaging in short sales. He attempts to cover up his \\nshort position by buying the securities at lower prices when prices decline. He may engage \\nin a bear raid so as to bring down the prices of securities. Spreading unfavourable rumours \\nabout companies with the intention of creating a decline in their share prices is known as \\na bear raid. The bear will suffer a loss if the prices of securities rise after he takes a short \\nposition on securities. When there is a general decline in prices of securities in the stock \\nmarket, the market is said to be bearish.\\nLame Duck \\nA lame duck is a bear who has made a short sale but is unable to meet his commitment \\nto deliver the securities sold by him on account of rise in prices of securities subsequent to \\nthe short sale. He is said to be struggling like a lame duck.\\nStag\\nA stag is a trader who applies for shares in the new issues market just like a genuine \\ninvestor. A stag is an optimist like the bull and expects a rise in the prices of securities that \\nhe has applied for. He anticipates that when the new shares are listed in the stock exchange \\nfor trading, they would be quoted at a premium, that is, above their issue price. As soon \\nas the stag receives the allotment of shares, he would sell them at the stock exchange at \\nthe higher price and make a profit. A stag is said to be a premium hunter. The stag will, \\nhowever, suffer a loss if prices of the new shares do not rise as anticipated when they are \\nlisted for trading.'),\n",

Other investors may use borrowed funds for buying \\nsecurities when there is a good opportunity to buy some securities but ready cash may not \\nbe available. \\nBorrowing money from the bank or the broker for purchasing securities is known as \\nmargin trading. The investor pays a part of the value of the securities to be purchased; the \\nbalance is provided by the broker or the banker. The cash paid by the investor is the margin. \\nFor example, if an investor places buy orders for purchase of securities worth ` 50,000 and \\npays as cash ` 30,000 to the broker, the investor’s margin is 60 per cent of the value of the \\nsecurities. The balance amount is supplied by the broker.\\nIn margin trading, the investor has to pay interest on the money borrowed to finance \\nthe securities transaction. Thus profit or gain from the transaction would be reduced to that \\nextent. Even if there is no gain from the securities transaction, interest on the borrowed \\nfunds has to be paid. Margin trading is thus a risky venture.\\nDepositories\\nFinancial securities such as equity shares, bonds and debentures are issued by \\ncompanies to the investors who purchase them. They used to be issued in the form of \\ncertificates specifying the name of the holder, the number of securities comprised in each \\ncertificate, the face value of the security, etc. When the securities are subsequently traded \\nbetween investors, the seller of the security hands over the certificate to the buyer through \\nthe stock exchange clearing house. The buyer then forwards the certificate to the issuing \\ncompany or its authorised transfer agents to get his name entered in the certificate as the \\nholder of the security. In this practice, the security has a physical form, namely that of a \\npaper certificate.\\nThe physical form of securities is giving way to electronic form of securities wherein \\na security is represented by an entry in a depository account opened by the investor for the \\npurpose. The transfer of securities on sale of a security is effected through a debit entry \\nin the depository account of the seller and a credit entry in the depository account of the \\nbuyer. The securities are issued, held and transferred in dematerialised form or ‘demat \\nmode’ . For the demat mode of shareholding, depositories play the most important role. Let \\nus understand what depositories are and how they function.'),\n",

A bank holds cash for customers and \\nprovides services related to transactions of cash. For this a customer opens an account in \\nany of the branches of the bank. A depository holds securities for investors in electronic \\nform and provides services related to transactions of securities. A depository interacts \\nwith clients through depository participants (DPs) which are organisations affiliated to \\na depository. An investor has to open a demat account with a depository participant to \\navail depository services of holding securities and transferring securities. There are two \\ndepositories in India namely:\\n1. National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)\\n2. Central Depositories Services (of India) Limited (CDSL)\\nNSDL was India’s first depository which started functioning on November 6, 1996. \\nCDSL was inaugurated on July 15, 1999. The functioning of these depositories is supervised \\nand regulated by SEBI. Each depository has several depository participants affiliated to it.\\nSEBI has now made it compulsory for trades in almost all listed securities to be \\nsettled in demat mode. For this purpose, registered members of stock exchanges open \\nclearing member accounts or pool accounts with depositories. These pool accounts are \\nused by member-brokers to hold securities from clients and deliver them to the clearing \\ncorporation. These accounts are also similarly used to receive securities from the clearing \\ncorporation for onward distribution to clients.\\nThe demat accounts opened by investors with depository participants are known \\nas beneficiary accounts. When an investor has sold a security through a member-broker, \\nhe has to deliver the security to the member-broker who, in turn, has to deliver it to the \\nclearing corporation. The investor has to authorise his DP to transfer the security from his \\nbeneficiary account to the clearing member’s pool account. Accordingly, the beneficiary \\naccount of the investor would be debited and the pool account of the clearing member would \\nbe credited. The clearing member gives authorisation to his DP to deliver the securities to \\nthe clearing corporation.\\nWhen an investor has purchased securities through member-brokers he has to receive \\nthe securities from the member-brokers. In the first instance, the clearing corporation will \\ninstruct its depository to credit the securities to the pool accounts of member-brokers who \\nare entitled to receive them on pay-out day. The member-broker then instructs his DP to \\ndebit his pool account and credit the beneficiary account of the client with the securities to \\nbe transferred to the client.'),\n",

This is done by the DP on a request from the investor. \\nSecurities in demat form (or electronic form) may again be converted back to the physical \\nform (certificates), if desired. This process is known as rematerialisation. At the time of \\nissue of new securities by a company, the securities allotted to an investor can be directly \\ncredited to his demat account.\\nAccording to the Depositories Act, 1996, an investor has the option to hold securities \\neither in physical form or in dematerialised form. But holding securities in demat form has \\nseveral advantages. It is safe and also convenient to hold securities in demat form. Transfer \\nof securities in physical form involves despatching of certificates through the postal service. \\nThis may result in delay, loss of certificate in transit, theft of certificate, damage to the \\ncertificate, etc. In demat form, transfer of securities is instantaneous and effortless. Much \\npaper work is done away with in demat mode.\\nStock Market Quotations and Indices\\nIn stock exchanges, continuous trading in securities takes place and these trades \\noccur at different prices. As a result, even on a single day, prices of securities may fluctuate. \\nOn any trading day, four prices can be easily identified, namely, opening price, closing price, \\nthe highest price of the day and the lowest price of the day. Apart from these short-term \\nintra-day fluctuations, prices of securities exhibit certain secular trends when considered \\nover a fairly long period of time. Prices may gradually increase over a long-term period; or \\nthey may decline over the long-term period. Ordinarily, prices move in a cyclical fashion, \\nalternatively showing increasing and declining tendencies.\\nThe short-term as well as long-term fluctuations in prices of securities are indicators \\nof the variations in the underlying economic variables. Hence, it is necessary to closely \\nobserve and monitor the movement of prices in the securities market. Price information \\nbecomes quite valuable for this purpose. Price quotations of traded securities are available \\nfrom the stock exchanges and are being published daily by most of the newspapers. Financial \\ndailies give very detailed price quotations (opening and closing prices, highest and lowest \\nprices, 52-week high and low prices, etc.), including the data on volume of daily trading.\\nIn addition to the price quotations of individual ‘securities, stock exchanges make \\navailable stock market indices, which are useful in understanding the level of prices and '),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='73\\nEconomy Analysis\\n The performance of a company depends on the performance of the economy. If the \\neconomy is booming, incomes rise, demand for goods increases, and hence the industries \\nand companies in general tend to the prosperous. On the other hand, if the economy is in \\nrecession, the performance of companies will be generally bad.\\nInvestors are concerned with those variables in the economy which affect the \\nperformance of the company in which they intend to invest. A study of these economic \\nvariables would give an idea about future corporate earnings and the payment of dividends \\nand interest part of his fundamental analysis.\\nGrowth Rates of National Income\\n The rate of growth of the national economy is an important variable to be considered \\nby an investor. GNP (gross national product), NNP (net national product) and GDP (gross \\ndomestic product) are the different measures of the total income or total economic output \\nof the country as a whole. The growth rates of these measures indicate the growth rate of \\nthe economy. The estimates of GNP , NNP and GDP and their rates are made available by \\nthe government from time to time.\\nThe estimated growth rate of the economy would be a pointer towards the prosperity \\nof the economy. An economy typically passes through different phases of prosperity known \\nas the different stages of the economic or business cycle. The four stages of an economic \\ncycle are depression, recovery, boom and recession. The stage of the economic cycle through \\nwhich a country passes has a direct impact on the performance of industries and companies.\\nDepression is the worst of the four stages. During a depression, demand is low and \\ndeclining. Inflation is often high and so are interest rates. Companies are forced to reduce \\nproduction, shut down plant and lay off workers. During the recovery stage, the economy \\nbegins to revive after a depression. Demand picks up leading to more investments in the \\neconomy. Production, employment and profits are on the increase.\\nThe boom phase of the economic cycle is characterized by high demand. Investments \\nand production are maintained at a high level to satisfy the high demand. Companies \\ngenerally post higher profits. The boom phase gradually slows down. The economy slowly \\nbegins to experience a downturn in demand, production, employment, etc. The profits of \\ncompanies also start to decline. This is the recession stage of the business cycle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='74\\nWhile analyzing the growth rate of the economy, an investor would do well to \\ndetermine the stage of the economic cycle through which the economy is passing and \\nevaluate its impact on his investment decision.\\nInflation\\n Inflation prevailing in the economy has considerable impact on the performance of \\ncompanies. Higher rates of inflation upset business plans, lead to cost escalation and result \\nin a squeeze on profit margins. \\n On the other hand, inflation leads to erosion of purchasing power in the hands of \\nconsumers. This will result in lower demand for products. Thus, high rates of inflation in \\nan economy are likely to affect the performance of companies adversely. Industries and \\ncompanies prosper during times of low inflation.\\n Inflation is measured both in terms of wholesale prices through the wholesale price \\nindex (WPI) and in terms of retail prices through the consumer price index (CPI). These \\nfigures are available on weekly or monthly basis. As part of the fundamental analysis, an \\ninvestor should evaluate the inflation rate prevailing in the economy currently as also the \\ntrend of inflation likely to prevail in the future.\\nInterest Rates\\n Interest rates determine the cost and availability of credit for companies operating in \\nan economy. A low interest rate stimulates investment by making credit available easily and \\ncheaply. Moreover, it implies lower cost of finance for companies and thereby assures higher \\nprofitability. On the contrary, higher interest rates result in higher cost of production which \\nmay lead to lower profitability and lower demand.\\nThe interest rates in the organized financial sector of the economy are determined \\nby the monetary policy of the government and the trends in money supply. These rates are \\nthus controlled and vary within certain ranges. \\nBut the interest rates in the unorganized financial sector are not controlled and may \\nfluctuate widely depending upon the demand and supply of funds in the market. Further, \\nlong-term interest rates differ from short-term interest rates.\\nAn investor has to consider the interest rates prevailing in the different segments of \\nthe economy and evaluate their impact on the performance and profitability of companies.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='75\\nGovernment Revenue, Expenditure and Deficits\\n As the government is the largest investor and spender of money, the trends in \\ngovernment revenue, expenditure and deficits have a significant impact on the performance \\nof industries and companies. Expenditure by the government stimulates the economy by \\ncreating jobs and generating demand. Since a major portion of demand in the economy \\nis generated by government spending, the nature of government spending is of great \\nimportance in determining the fortunes of many an industry.\\nHowever, when government expenditure exceeds its revenue, there occurs a deficit. \\nThis deficit is known as budget deficit. All developing countries suffer from budget deficits \\nas government spend large amount of money to build up infrastructure. But budget deficit is \\nan important determinant of inflation, as it leads to deficit financing which fuels inflation.\\nExchange Rates\\n The performance and profitability of industries and companies that are major \\nimporters or exporters are considerably affected by the exchange rates of the rupee against \\nmajor currencies of the world. A depreciation of the rupee improves the competitive position \\nof Indian products in foreign markets, thereby stimulating exports. But it would also make \\nimports more expensive. A company depending heavily on imports may find devaluation of \\nthe rupee affecting its profitability adversely.\\n The exchange rates of the rupee are influenced by the balance of trade deficit, the \\nbalance of payments deficit and also the foreign exchange reserves of the country. The \\nexcess of imports over exports is called balance of trade deficit. The balance of payments \\ndeficit represents the net difference payable on account of all transactions such as trade, \\nservices and capital transaction. If these deficits increase, there is a possibility that the \\nrupee may depreciate in value.\\n A country needs foreign exchange reserves to meet several commitments such as \\npayment for imports and servicing of foreign debts. Balance of payment deficit typically \\nleads to decline in foreign exchange reserves as the deficit has to be met from the reserve. \\nThe size of the foreign exchange reserve is a measure of the strength of the rupee on external \\naccount. Large foreign exchange reserves help to increase the value of the rupee against \\nother currencies.\\n The exchange rates of the rupee against the major currencies of the world are \\npublished daily in the financial press. An investor has to keep track of the trend in exchange '),\n",

An analysis of the balance of trade deficit, balance of payments deficit and \\nthe foreign exchange reserves will help to project the future trends in exchange rates.\\nInfrastructure\\n The development of an economy depends very much on the infrastructure available. \\nIndustry needs electricity for its manufacturing activities, roads and railways to transport \\nraw materials and finished goods, communication channels to keep in touch with suppliers \\nand customers.\\n The availability of infrastructural facilities such as power, transportation and \\ncommunication systems affects the performance of companies. Bad infrastructure leads to \\ninefficiencies, lower productivity, wastage and delays. An investor should assess the status \\nof the infrastructural facilities available in the economy before finalizing has investment \\nplans.\\nMonsoon\\n The Indian economy is essentially an agrarian economy and agriculture forms a  \\nvery important sector of the Indian economy. Because of the strong forward and back -\\nward linkages between agriculture and industry, performance of several industries and  \\ncompanies are dependent on the performance of agriculture. Moreover, as agricultural  \\nincomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will be good and industry \\nwill prosper.\\n But the performance of agriculture to a very great extent depends on the monsoon. \\nThe adequacy of the monsoon determines the success or failure of the agricultural activities \\nin India. Hence, the progress and adequacy of the monsoon becomes a matter of great \\nconcern for an investor in the Indian context.\\nEconomic and Political Stability\\n A stable political environment is necessary for steady and balanced growth. No \\nindustry or company can grow and prosper in the midst of political turmoil. Stable long-\\nterm economic policies are what are needed for industrial growth. Such stable policies \\ncan emanate only from stable political systems as economic and political factors are inter-\\nlinked. A stable government with clear cut long – term economic policies will be conducive \\nto good performance of the economy. '),\n",

But as investment is a future-oriented activity, \\nthe investor is more interested in the expected future performance of the overall economy \\nand its various segments. For this, forecasting the future direction of the economy becomes \\nnecessary. Economic forecasting thus becomes a key activity in economy analysis.\\nThe central theme in economic forecasting is to forecast the national income with its \\nvarious components. Gross national product or GNP is a measure of the national income. It \\nis the total value of the final output of goods and services produced in the economy. It is a \\nmeasure of the total economic activities over a specified period of time and is an indicator \\nof the level and rate of growth of economic activities. An investor would be particularly \\ninterested in forecasting the various components of the national income, especially those \\ncomponents that have a bearing on the particular industries and companies that he is \\nanalysing.\\nForecasting Techniques\\n Economic forecasting may be carried out for short-term periods (up to three years), \\nintermediate term periods (three to five years) and long-term periods (more than five years). \\nAn investor is more concerned about short-term economic forecasts for periods ranging \\nfrom a quarter to three years. Some of the techniques of short-term economic forecasting \\nare discussed below:\\nAnticipatory Surveys\\nMuch of the activities in government, business, trade and industry are planned in \\nadvance and stated in the form of budgets. Consumers also plan for their major spending \\nin advance. To the extent that institutions and people plan and budget for expenditures in \\nadvance, surveys of their intentions can provide valuable input to short-term economic \\nforecasting.\\nAnticipatory surveys are the surveys of intentions of people in government, \\nbusiness, trade and industry regarding their construction activities, plant and machinery \\nexpenditures, level of inventory, etc. Such surveys may also include the future plans of \\nconsumers with regard to their spending on durables and non-durables. Based on the results \\nof these surveys, the analyst can form his own forecast of the future state of the economy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='78\\nThe greatest shortcoming of the anticipatory surveys is that there is no guarantee \\nthat the intentions surveyed will certainly materialise. The forecast based on anticipatory \\nsurveys or surveys of intentions will be valid only to the extent that the intentions are \\ntranslated into action. Hence, the analyst cannot rely solely on these surveys.\\nBarometric or Indicator Approach\\n In this approach to economic forecasting, various types of indicators are studied to \\nfind out how the economy is likely to perform in the future. These indicators are time series \\ndata of certain economic variables. The indicators are classified into leading, coincidental \\nand lagging indicators.\\n The leading indicators are those time series data that reach their high points (peaks) \\nor their low points (troughs) in advance of the high points and low points of total economic \\nactivity. The coincidental indicators reach their peaks and troughs at approximately the \\nsame time as the economy, while the lagging indicators reach their turning points after the \\neconomy has already reached its own turning points. In this method, the indicators1 act as \\nbarometers to indicate the future level of economic activity. However, careful examination \\nof historical data of economic series is necessary to ascertain which economic variables \\nhave led, lagged behind or moved together with the economy.\\n The US Department of Commerce, through its Bureau of Economic Analysis, has \\nprepared a short list of the different indicators. Some of them are given below for illustrative \\npurpose.\\nLeading Indicators\\n Average weekly hours of manufacturing production workers\\n Average weekly initial unemployment claims\\nContracts and orders for plant and machinery\\nNumber of new building permits issued\\nIndex of S and P 500 stock prices\\nMoney supply (M2)\\n Change in sensitive materials prices\\nChange in manufactures’ unfilled orders (durable goods industries)\\nIndex of consumer expectations'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='79\\nCoincidental Indicators\\n Employees on non-agricultural pay rolls\\n Personal income less transfer payments\\n Index of industrial production\\n Manufacturing and trade sales\\nLagging Indicators\\n Average duration of unemployment\\n Ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to sales\\n Average prime rate\\n Commercial and industrial loans outstanding\\n Change in consumer price index for services\\nOf the three types of indicators, leading indicators are more useful for economic \\nforecasting because they measure something that foreshadows a change in economic activity. \\n The indicator approach has its own limitations. It is useful in forecasting the direction \\nof the change in aggregate economic activity, but it does not indicate the magnitude or \\nduration of the change. Further, the leading indicators may give false signals. Moreover, \\ndifferent leading indicators may give conflicting signals. The indicator approach becomes \\nuseful for economic forecasting only if data collection and presentation are done quickly. \\nAny delay in presentation of data defeats the purpose of the indicators. \\nEconometric Model Building\\n This is the most precise and scientific of the different forecasting techniques. This \\ntechnique makes use of Econometrics, which is a discipline that applies mathematical and \\nstatistical techniques to economic theory.\\nIn the economic field we find complex interrelationships between the different \\neconomic variables. The precise relationships between the dependent and independent \\nvariables are specified in a formal mathematical manner in the form of equations. The \\nsystem of equations is then solved to yield a forecast that is quite precise.\\nIn applying this technique, the analyst is forced to define learly and precisely the \\ninterrelationships between the economic variables. The accuracy of the forecast derived '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='80\\nfrom this technique would depend on the validity of the assumptions made by the analyst \\nregarding economic interrelationships and the quality of his input data.\\nEconometric models used for economic forecasting are generally complex. Vast \\namounts of data are required to be collected and processed for the solution of the model. \\nThis may cause delay in making the results available. Undue delay may render the results \\nobsolete for purpose of forecasting.\\nOpportunistic Model Building\\n This is one of the most widely used forecasting techniques. It is also known as GNP \\nmodel building or sectoral analysis.\\nInitially, an analyst estimates the total demand in the economy, and based on this he \\nestimates the total income or GNP for the forecast period. This initial estimate takes into \\nconsideration the prevailing economic environment such as the existing tax rates, interest \\nrates, rate of inflation and other economic and fiscal policies of the government. \\nAfter this initial forecast is arrived at, the analyst now begins building up a forecast of \\nthe GNP figure by estimating the levels of various components of GNP . For this, he collects \\nthe figures of consumption expenditure, gross private domestic investment, government \\npurchase of goods and services and net exports. He adds these figures together to arrive at \\nthe GNP forecast.\\nThe two GNP forecasts arrived at by two different methods will be compared and \\nnecessary adjustments will be made to bring the two forecasts into line with each other.\\nThe opportunistic model building approach makes use of other forecasting \\ntechniques to build up the various components. A vast amount of judgement and ingenuity \\nis also applied to make the overall forecast reliable.\\nEconomic forecasting is an extremely complex and difficult process. No method is \\nexpected to give accurate results. The investor must evaluate all economic forecasts critically \\nbefore making his investment decision.\\nEconomy analysis is an important part of fundamental analysis. It gives the investor \\nan overall picture of the expected performance of the economy in the near future. This is a \\nvaluable input to investment decision-making.\\n****'),\n",

For the convenience of the investors, the broad \\nclassification of the industry is given in financial dailies and magazines. Companies are \\ndistinctly classified to give a clear picture about their manufacturing process and products. \\nThe table gives the industry wise classification given in Reserve Bank of India Bulletin.\\nIndustry Groups\\nIndustries\\n1 Food Products\\n2 Beverages, Tobacco and Tobacco products\\n3 Textiles\\n4 Wood and wood products\\n5 Leather and leather products\\n6 Rubber and plastic products\\n7 Chemical and chemical products\\n8 Non-metallic mineral products\\n9 Basic metals, alloys and metal products\\n10 Machinery and Machine tools\\n11 Transport equipment and parts\\n12 Other Miscellaneous manufacturing industries\\n The table shows that each industry is different from the other. Textile industry is \\nentirely different from the steel industry or the power industry in its product and process.\\n These industries can be classified on the basis of the business cycle i.e., classified \\naccording reactions to the different phases of the business cycle. They are classified into \\ngrowth, cyclical, defensive and cyclical growth industry. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='82\\nGrowth Industry\\n The growth industries have special features of high rate of earnings and growth \\nin expansion, independent of the business cycle. The expansion of the industry mainly \\ndepends on the technological change. For instance, inspite of the recession in the Indian \\neconomy in 1997-98, there was a spurt in the growth of information technology. It defied \\nthe business cycle and continued to grow. Like wise in every phase of the history certain \\nindustries like colour televisions, pharmaceutical and telecommunication industries have \\nshown remarkable growth.\\nCyclical Industry\\n The growth and the profitability of the industry move along with the business cycle. \\nDuring the boom period they enjoy growth and during depression they suffer a set back. \\nFor example, the white goods like fridge, washing machine and kitchen range products \\ncommand a good market in the boom period and the demand for them slackens during the \\nrecession\\nDefensive Industry\\n Defensive industry defies the movement of the business cycle. For example, food and \\nshelter are the basic requirements of humanity. The food industry withstands recession and \\ndepression. The stocks of the defensive industries can be held by the investor for income \\nearning purpose. They expand and earn income in the depression period too, under the \\ngovernment’s umbrella of protection and are counter cyclical in nature.\\nCyclical Growth Industry\\n This is new type of industry that is cyclical and at the same time growing. For \\nexample, the automobile industry experiences periods of stagnation, decline but they \\ngrow tremendously. The change in technology and introduction of new models help the \\nautomobile industry to resume their growth path.\\nIndustry Life Cycle\\n The industry life cycle theory is generally attributed to Julius Grodensky. The life \\ncycle of the industry is separated into four well defined stages such as\\n  ➢ Pioneering stage\\n  ➢ Rapid growth stage'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='83\\n  ➢ Maturity and stabilization stage\\n  ➢ Declining stage\\nPioneering Stage\\n The prospective demand for the product is promising in this stage and the technology \\nof the product is low. The demand for the product attracts many producers to produce the \\nparticular product. There would be severe competition and only fittest companies survive \\nthis stage. The producers try to develop brand name, differentiate the product and create \\na product image. This would lead to non-price competition too. The severe competition \\noften leads to the change of position of the firms in terms of market shares and profit. In \\nthis situation, it is difficult to select companies for investment because the survival rate is \\nunknown.\\nRapid Growth Stage\\n This stage starts with the appearance of surviving firms from the pioneering stage. \\nThe companies that have withstood the competition grow strongly in market share and \\nfinancial performance. The technology of the production would have improved resulting in \\nlow cost of production and good quality products. The companies have stable growth rate \\nin this stage and they declare dividend to the share holders. It is advisable to invest in the \\nshares of these companies. The pharmaceutical industry has improved its technology and \\nthe top companies in this sector are giving dividend to the shareholders. Likewise power \\nindustry and telecommunication industry can be cited as examples of expansion stage. In \\nthis stage the growth rate is more than the industry’s average growth rate.\\nMaturity and Stabilization Stage\\n \\n In the stabilization stage, the growth rate tends to moderate and the rate of growth \\nwould be more or less equal to the industrial growth rate or the gross domestic product \\ngrowth rate. Symptoms of obsolescence may appear in the technology. The keep going, \\ntechnological innovations in the production process and products should be introduced. \\nThe investors have to closely monitor the events that take place in the maturity stage of the \\nindustry.\\nDeclining Stage\\n In this stage, demand for the particular product and the earnings of the companies \\nin the industry decline. Now-a-days very few consumers demand black and white T.V . '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='84\\ninnovation of new products and change in consumer preferences lead to this stage. The \\nspecific feature of the declining stage is that even in the boom period; the growth of the \\nindustry would be low and decline at a higher rate during the recession. It is better to avoid \\ninvesting in the shares of the low growth industry even in the boom period. Investment in \\nthe shares of these types of companies leads to erosion of capital\\nFactors to be Considered\\n Apart from industry life cycle analysis, the investor has to analyse some other factors \\ntoo. They are as listed below\\n  ➢ Growth of the industry\\n  ➢ Cost structure and profitability\\n  ➢ Nature of the product\\n  ➢ Nature of the competition\\n  ➢ Government policy\\n  ➢ Labour\\n  ➢ Research and development\\nGrowth of the Industry\\n The historical performance of the industry in terms of growth and profitability \\nshould be analysed. Industry wise growth is published periodically by the Centre for \\nMonitoring Indian Economy. The past variability in return and growth in reaction to macro \\neconomic factors provide an insight into the future. Even though history may not repeat \\nin the exact manner, looking into the past growth of the industry, the analyst can predict \\nthe future. The information technology industry has witnessed a tremendous growth in the \\npast so also the scrip prices of the IT industry. With the Y2K millennium bug creating a \\nhuge business opportunity even beyond the year 2000, the sector is expected to maintain its \\ngrowth momentum.\\nCost Structure and Profitability\\n The cost structure, that is the fixed and variable cost, affects the cost of production \\nand profitability of the firm. In the case of oil and natural gas industry and iron and steel \\nindustry the fixed cost portion is high and the gestation period is also lengthy. Higher the \\nfixed cost component, greater sales volume is required to reach the firm’s breakeven point. \\nOnce the breakeven point is reached and the production is on the track, the profitability can '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='85\\nbe increased by utilizing the capacity to full. Once the maximum capacity is reached, again \\ncapital has to invest in the fixed equipment. Hence, lower the fixed cost, adjustability to the \\nchanging demand and reaching the break even points are comparatively easier.\\nNature of the Product\\n The products produced by the industries are demanded by the consumers and other \\nindustries. If industrial goods like pig iron, iron sheet and coils are produced, the demand \\nfor them depends on the construction industry. Likewise, textile machine tools industry \\nproduces tools for the textile industry and the entire demand depends upon the health of \\nthe textile industry. Several such examples can be cited. The investor has to analyse the \\ncondition of related goods producing industry and the end user industry to find out the \\ndemand for industrial goods. \\n In the case of consumer goods industry, the change in the consumers’ preference, \\ntechnological innovations and substitute products affect the demand. A simple example \\nis that the demand for the ink pen is affected by the ball point pen with the change in the \\nconsumer preference towards the easy usage of pen.\\nNature of the Competition\\n Nature of competition is an essential factor that determines the demand for the \\nparticular product, its profitability and the price of the concerned company scrips. The \\nsupply may arise from indigenous producers and multinationals. In the case of detergents, \\nit is produced by indigenous manufactures and distributed locally at a competitive price. \\nThis poses a threat to the company made products. The multinational are also entering \\ninto the field with sophisticated product process and better quality product. Now the \\ncompanies’ ability to withstand the local as well as the multinational competition counts \\nmuch. If too many firms are present in the organized sector, the competition would be \\nsevere. The competition would lead to a decline in the price of the product. The investor \\nbefore investing in the scrip of a company should analyse the market share of the particular \\ncompany’s product and should compare it with the top five companies.\\nGovernment Policy\\n The government policies affect the very nerve of the industry and the effects \\ndiffer from industry to industry. Tax subsidies and tax holidays are provided for export \\noriented products. Government regulates the size of the production and the pricing of \\ncertain products. The sugar, fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries are often affected '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content='86\\nby the inconsistent government polices. Control and decontrol of sugar price affect the \\nprofitability of the sugar industry. In some cases entry barriers are placed by the government. \\nIn the airways, private corporate are permitted to operate the domestic flights only. When \\nselecting an industry, the government policy regarding the particular industry should be \\ncarefully evaluated. Liberalization and delicensing have brought immense threat to the \\nexisting domestic industries in several sectors.\\nLabor\\n The analysis of labor scenario in a particular industry is of great importance. The \\nnumber of trade unions and their operating mode has impact on the labour productivity and \\nmodernization of the industry. Textile industry is known for its militant trade unions. If the \\ntrade unions are strong and strikes occur frequently, it would lead to fall in the production. \\nIn an industry of high fixed cost, the stoppage of production may lead to loss. \\n When trade unions oppose the introduction of automation, in the product market the \\ncompany may stand to lose with high cost of production. The unhealthy labour relationship \\nleads to loss of customers’ goodwill too.\\n Skilled labour is needed for certain industries. In the case of Indian labour market, \\neven in computer technology or in any other industry skilled and well-qualified labour is \\navailable at a cheaper rate. This is one of the many reasons attracting the multinationals to \\nset up companies in India.\\nResearch and Development\\n For any industry to survive the competition in the national and international \\nmarkets, product and production process have to be technically competitive. This depends \\non the R & D in the particular company or industry. Economies of scale and new market \\ncan be obtained only through R & D. the percentage of expenditure made on R & D should \\nbe studied diligently before making an investment.\\nPollution Standards\\n Pollution standards are very high and strict in the industrial sector. For some \\nindustries it may be heavier than others; for example, in leather, chemical and pharmaceutical \\nindustries the industrial effluents are more.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='87\\nSWOT Analysis  \\n The above mentioned factors themselves would become strength, weakness, \\nopportunity and threat (SWOT) for the industry. Hence, the investor should carry out \\na SWOT analysis for the chosen industry. Take for instance, increase in demand for the \\nindustry’s product becomes its strength, presence of numerous players in the market, i.e. \\ncompetition becomes the threat to a particular company in the respective industry. The \\nprogress in the research and development in that particular industry is an opportunity and \\nentry of multinationals in the industry and cheap imports of the particular products are \\nthreat to that industry. In this way the factors have to be arranged and analysed. To make the \\nindustry analysis more explanatory it has been carried out on the pharmaceutical industry \\nand SWOT analysis results are also given.\\nPharmaceutical Industry\\nGrowth of the Industry \\n The industry has witnessed healthy growth in the recent past and investment in \\npharmaceutical industry is continuing. The product output is also increasing and operational \\nand business management efficiency also seem to have improved.

The process is very complex in nature. The processes are classified into primary \\nand secondary. The primary process requires uninterrupted power supply, maintaining of \\nconditions under which the molecules react and yield a new product, excellent manufacturing \\nconditions and well-trained personnel. Specific plants costs less but, they have the risk of '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='88\\nobsolescence. Multipurpose plants are expensive and have no risk of obsolescence but, they \\nhave the risk of cross contamination. The secondary process is the conver sion of bulk drugs \\ninto formulations. The secondary process is not much technology intensive and has low \\ncapital cost. Hence, there are many players in the market.\\nNature of the Product \\nThe products of the pharmaceutical industry are broadly classified into bulk \\ndrugs, formulations and intravenous fluids. Bulk drugs are like Ciproflaxacin, Ibuprofen, \\nRanitidine, Ethanbutol, etc. The major manufactures of the products are Ranbaxy, Cipla, \\nCadilla, Dr.Reddys’ Lab and Lupin. Some companies manufacture formulations from bulk \\ndrugs and market them under brands. Companies also manufacture formulations for \\nother companies. Some of the companies in the formulation segment are Ranbaxy, Cipla, \\nWockhardt, Lupin etc.\\nIntravenous fluids are preparations which aid in quick replenishment of body fluids. \\nBulk drugs and formulations companies produce intravenous fluids also. The formulations \\nare produced by firms from all over the country. Andhra Pradesh stands first in the \\nproduction of bulk drugs.\\nDemand for the Product \\nThe Indian pharmaceutical market which was worth Rs90 billion in 1997, is growing \\nat 13.7% rate. But only three out of ten Indians have access to allopathic drug. Even in this \\nsegment vast majority of them belong to urban area. Investments in medical and public \\nhealth declined from 2% of the total capital outlay in the sixth five year plan to 1.75% in the \\nEighth five year plan. In the year 1996-97, the portion in the annual budget was of 1.7%.\\nThe less than 15 age segment of the population is expected to grow at 0.5% but the \\nfastest growth is expected in the 50-59 groups. This has led to a shift in the demand from \\nthe life saving drugs to life enhancing drugs. It is referred to as a shift from age old diseases \\nto old age diseases.\\nCompetition \\nThe industry is having 2400 players within the organised sector and around 15,000 \\nin small-scale sector.

If the market share is high, the company would \\nbe able to meet the terms of sales in 1997. While analyzing the market share, the size of the \\ncompany also should be considered because the smaller companies may find it difficult to \\nsurvive in the future. The leading companies of today’s market will continue to lead at least \\nin the near future. The companies in the market should be compared with like product \\ngroups otherwise, the results will be misleading. A software company should be compared \\nwith other software companies to select the best in that industry.\\nGrowth of Sales \\nThe company may be a leading company, but if the growth in sales in comparatively \\nlower than another company, it indicates the possibility of the company losing the leadership. \\nThe rapid growth in sales would keep the shareholder in a better position than one with the \\nstagnant growth rate. The company of large size with inadequate growth in sales will not \\nbe preferred by the investors. Growth in sales is usually followed by the growth in profits. \\nInvestor generally prefers size and the growth in sales because the larger size companies \\nmay be able to withstand the business cycle rather than the company of smaller size.\\n The growth in sales of the company is analysed both in rupee terms and in physical \\nterms. Physical term is very essential because it shows the growth in real terms. The rupee \\nterm is affected by the inflation. Companies with diversified sales are compared in rupee \\nterms and percentage of growth over time.\\nStability of Sales \\nIf a firm has stable sales revenue, other things being remaining constant, will have \\nmore stable earning and wide variations in capacity utilization, financial planning and \\ndividend. Periodically all the financial newspapers provide information about the market \\nshare of different companies in an industry. The fall in the market share indicates the \\ndeclining trend of the company, even if the sales are stable in absolute terms. Hence, the \\nstability of sales also should be compared with its market share and the competitors’ market \\nshares.'),\n",

For this purpose, forecast of sales has to be done. He can forecast \\nthe sales in different ways.\\n1. The investor can fit a trend line either linear or nor linear whichever is suitable.\\n2. Historical percentage of company sales to the industry sales can be analysed. Even \\nsimple least square technique could be used to find out the function Cs = f (I) i.e. \\nCs – company sales; I – Industry sales.\\n3. The sales growth can be compared with the macro-economic variables like gross \\ndomestic product, per capita income and population growth.\\n4. The different components of demand for the company’s product have to be analysed \\nbecause the demand may arise from different sources. For some product the demand \\nmay be from the consumers as well as from the industries. For example, steel and \\npetroleum products are demand by consumers and industries.\\n5. The demand for the substitutes and competitors’ product also should be analysed \\nusing least square techniques.\\nEarnings of the Company\\nSales alone do not increase the earnings but the costs and expenses of the company \\nalso influence the earnings of the company. Further, earnings do not always increase with \\nthe increase in sales. The company’s sales might have increased but its earnings per share \\nmay decline due to the rise in costs. The rate of change in earnings differs from the rate \\nof change of sales. Sales may increase by 10% in a company but earnings per share may \\nincrease only by 5%. Even though there is a relationship between sales and earnings, it is not \\na perfect one. Sometimes, the volume of sales may decline but the earnings may improve \\ndue to the rise in the unit price of the article. Hence, the investor should not depend only \\non the sales, but should analyse the earnings of the company.\\nThe income for the company is generated through operating sources and non-\\noperating sources. The sources of operating income vary from industry to industry. For \\nthe service industry no tangible product is involved and income is generated through \\nsales of services. Take the case of commercial bank, its income is the interest on loans and \\ninvestments. Interest income is referred to operating income. But in the case of industries \\nproducing tangible goods earnings arise from the sale of goods.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='94\\nThe companies, in addition to the revenue from sales, may get revenue from other \\nsources too. The non-operating income may be generated from interest from bonds, rentals \\nfrom lease, dividends from securities and sale of assets. The investor should analyse the \\nincome source diligently whether it is from the sale of assets or it is from investments. \\nSometimes earning per share may seem to be attractive in a particular year but in actual \\ncase the revenue generated through sales may be comparatively lower than in the previous \\nyear. The earnings might have been generated through the sale of assets. \\nThe investor should be aware that income of the company may vary due to the \\nfollowing reasons.\\n  ➢ Change in sales\\n  ➢ Change in costs\\n  ➢ Depreciation method adopted\\n  ➢ Depletion of resources in the case of oil, mining, forest products, gas etc.\\n  ➢ Inventory accounting method\\n  ➢ Replacement cost of inventories\\n  ➢ Wages, salaries and fringe benefits\\n  ➢ Income taxes and other taxes.\\nCapital Structure\\nThe equity holders’ return can be increased manifold with the help of financial \\nleverage, i.e., using debt financing along with equity financing. The effect of financial \\nleverage is measured by computing leverage ratios. The debt ratio indicates the position of \\nthe long term and short term debts in the company finance. The debt may be in the form of \\ndebentures and term loans from financial institutions.\\nPreference Shares\\nIn the early days the preference share capital was never a significant source of capital. \\nAt present, many companies resort to preference shares. The preference shares induct some \\ndegree of leverage in finance. The leverage effect of the preference shares is comparatively \\nlesser than the debt because the preference share dividends are not tax deductible. If the \\nportion of preference share in the capital is larger, it tends to create instability in the earnings \\nof the equity shares when the earnings of the company fluctuate. Sometimes the preference \\nshare may be convertible preference share; in that case it dilutes the earnings per share. So \\nthe investor should look into the preference share component of the capital structure.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 98}, page_content='95\\nDebt \\nLong term debt is an important source of finance. It has the specific benefit of \\nlow cost of capital because interest is tax deductible. The leverage effect of debt is highly \\nadvantageous to the equity holders. During the boom period the positive side of the leverage \\neffect increases the earnings of the share holders. At the same time, during recession the \\nleverage effect inducts instability in earnings per share and can lead to bankruptcy. Hence, \\nit is important to limit the debt component of the capital to a reasonable level. The limit \\ndepends on the firm’s earning capacity and its fixed assets.\\ni) Earnings Limit of Debt\\nThe earnings determine whether the debt is excessive or not. The earnings indicate \\nthe probability of insolvency. The ratio used to find out the limit of the debts is the interest \\ncoverage ratio i.e., the ratio of net income after taxes to interest paid on debt. The ratio \\nshows the firm’s ability to pay the interest charges, the number of times interest is covered \\nby earnings.\\nii) Assets Limit to Debt\\nThis asset limit is found out by fixed assets to debt ratio. The financing of fixed assets \\nby the debt should be within a reasonable limit. For industrial units the recommended ratio \\nlevel is below 0.5.\\nManagement\\nGood and capable management generates profit to the investors. The management \\nof the firm should efficiently plan, organize, actuate and control the activities of the \\ncompany. The basic objective of management is to attain the stated objectives of company \\nare achieved, investors will have a profit. A management that ignores profit does more harm \\nto the investors than one that over emphasizes it.\\n The good management depends on the qualities of the manager. Koontz and \\nO’Donnell suggest the following as a special trait of an able manager:\\n  ➢ Ability to get along with people\\n  ➢ Leadership\\n  ➢ Analytical competence'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='96\\n  ➢ Industry\\n  ➢ Judgement\\n  ➢ Ability to get things done\\nSince the traits are difficult to measure, managerial performance is evaluated \\nagainst setting and accomplishing a verifiable objective. If the investor needs greater proof \\nof excellence of management, he has to analyse management ability. The analysis can be \\ncarried out on the following ways:\\na) The background of managerial personnel contributes much to the success of the \\nmanagement. The manager’s age, educational background, advancement within the \\ncompany, levels of responsibility achieved and the activities in the social sphere can \\nbe studied.\\nb) The record of management over the past years has to be reviewed. For several \\ncompanies what the top management have done during its tenure in office are given \\nin the financial weeklies and monthlies along with critical comments. This gives an \\ninsight into the ability of the top management.\\nc) The management’s skill to have market share ahead of others is a proof of managerial \\nsuccess. The investor can rely on this type of management and choose the stock.\\nd) The next criterion the investor should analyse is the company’s strength to expand. A \\nfirm may expand from within and diversify products in the known lines. Sometimes \\nit may acquire an other company to expand its market. The horizontal or vertical \\nexpansion of the production is a health sign of an efficient management.\\ne) The management’s ability to maintain efficient production by proper utilization or \\nplant and machinery has to be analysed. Suitable inventory planning and scheduling \\nhave to be drafted and worked out by the management.\\nf) The management’s capacity to finance the company adequately has to be studied. \\nAccomplishing the financial requirement is a direct reflection of managerial ability. \\nThe management should adopt a realistic dividend policy in relation to earnings. A \\nrealistic dividend policy boosts the image of the company’s stock in the market.\\ng) The functional ability of management to work with employees and union is another \\narea of concern. A union poses a threat to the smooth functioning of the firm. In this \\ncontext the management should be able to maintain harmonious relationship with \\nthe employees and unions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='97\\nh) The management’s adaptability to scientific management and quality control \\ntechniques should be analysed. The management should be able to give due weightage \\nto maintain technical competence.\\nAfter analyzing the above mentioned factors, the investor should select companies \\nthat possess excellent management and maintain the competitive position of the company in \\nthe market. The investor should also remember that the individual traits of a single manager \\nalone cannot make the company profitable and there should be a strong management system \\nto do so.\\nOperating Efficiency\\nThe operating efficiency of a company directly affects the earnings of a company. An \\nexpanding company that maintains high operating efficiency with a low break-even point \\nearns more than the company with high break-even point. If a firm has stable operating \\nratio, the revenues also would be stable. \\nEfficient use of fixed assets with raw materials, labour and management would lead \\nto more income from sales. This leads to internal fund generation for the expansion of the \\nfirm. A growing company should have low operating ratio to meet the growing demand for \\nits product.\\nOperating Leverage\\nIf the firm’s fixed cost is high in the total cost the firm is said to have a high degree \\nof operating leverage. Leverage means the use of a lever to raise a heavy object with a small \\nforce. High degree of operating leverage implies, other factors being held constant, relatively \\nsmall change in sales result in a large change in return on equity. This can be explained with \\nthe help of the following example.\\n Let us take firm A and B. The firm A has relatively small amount of fixed charges \\nsay, ` 40,000. Firm A would not have much automated equipment, so its depreciation and \\nmaintenance costs are low. The variable cost per cent is higher than it would be if the firm \\nused more automated equipment, In the other case firm B has high fixed costs, ` 1,20,000. \\n Here the firm uses automated equipment (with which one operator can turn out \\nmany units at the same labour cost) to a much larger extent. The break-even occurs at \\n40,000 units in firm A and 60,000 units in firm B. The selling price (P) is ` 4; the variable \\ncost is ` 3 for firm A and ` 2 for firm B percent.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='98\\nThe break-even occurs when ROE (return on equity) = 0, and hence, when earnings \\nbefore interest and taxes (EBIT) = 0.\\nEBIT = 0 = PQ – VQ – F\\nHere P is the average sales price per unit of output, Q is units of output, V is the vari -\\nable cost per unit, and F is the fixed operating costs. The break-even quantity is = F / (P-V)\\nFor Firm A = ` 40,000     = 40,000 units\\n  ` 4 – ` 3\\nFirsm B = ` 2,20,000  = 60,000 units\\n  ` 4 – ` 2\\nTo a large extent, operating leverage is determined by technology. For example, \\ntelephone companies, iron and steel companies and electric utilities have heavy investments \\nin fixed assets leading to high fixed costs and operating leverage. On the other hand \\ncosmetics companies, and consumer goods producing companies may need significantly \\nlower fixed costs, and hence lower operating leverage.\\nThe investor should understand the operating leverage of the firm because the \\nfirm with high operating leverage is affected much by the cyclical decline. The operating \\nefficiency of the firm determines the profit expectation of the company.\\nFinancial Analysis\\nThe best source of financial information about a company is its own financial \\nstatements. This is a primary source of information for evaluating the investment prospects \\nin the particular company’s stock. Financial statement analysis is the study of a company’s \\nfinancial statement from various viewpoints. The statement gives the historical and current \\ninformation about the company’s operations.

Financial ratio \\nprovides numerical relationship between two relevant financial data. Financial ratios are \\ncalculated from the balance sheet and loss account. The relationship can be either expressed \\nas a percent or as a quotient. Ratios summarise the data for easy understanding, comparison \\nand interpretation. Financial ratios may be divided into six groups. \\nThey are listed below: \\n  ➢ Liquidity Ratios\\n  ➢ Turnover Ratios\\n  ➢ Leverage Ratios\\n  ➢ Profit Margin Ratios\\n  ➢ Return on Investment Ratios\\n  ➢ Valuation Ratios\\nLiquidity Ratio\\nLiquidity means the ability of the firm to meet its short term obligations. Current \\nratio and acid test ratio are the most popular ratios used to analyse the liquidity. The liquidity \\nratio indicates the liquidity in a rough fashion and the adequacy of the working capital. '),\n",

Compared to that the liquidity \\nposition of Sky Ltd. is favourable. The acid test ratio of 1.06 shows that the company is able \\nto meet current liabilities. Y et, the company has to work out plans to reduce the inventory \\nlevel a little below the present level.\\nTurnover Ratios\\nThe turnover ratios show how well the assets are used the extent of excess inventory, \\nif any. These ratios are also known as activity ratios or asset management ratios. Commonly \\ncalculated ratios are sales to current assets, sales to fixed assets, sales to inventory, receivable \\nto sales and total assets to turnover. Each ratio has a specific application. Sales to current \\nasset ratio shows the utilization of the current assets and sales to fixed asset ratio indicates \\nthe fixed asset utilization. The sales to inventory management.

The \\ndifference between the two ratios is caused by financial leverage. When both the ratios \\nare compared, the ROE is greater than ROA. It indicates that the Sky Ltd has employed \\nborrowed funds efficiently to lever the rate of return to the advantage of shareholders.\\nValuation Ratios\\nThe shareholders are interested in assessing the value of the shares. The value of the \\nshare depends on the performance of the firm and the market factors. The performance \\nof the firm in turn depends on a host of factors. Hence, the valuation ratios provide a \\ncomprehensive measure of the performance of the firm itself. In the subsequent section, \\nsome of the valuation ratios are dealt in detail.\\nBook Value Per Share\\nThis ratio indicates the share of equity shareholders after the company has paid \\nall its liabilities, creditors, debenture holders and preference shareholders. At the time of \\nliquidation, the shareholders can know what remains after making all the payments. In \\nordinary time also it helps the shareholder to find out his real position in the company.\\n Book value per share     =  Eqity share capital + Reserve\\n     Total number of equity shares outstanding\\n OR\\n        =      Networth – Preference share capital\\n     Total number of equity shares outstanding\\n        =    50000 (Rs in lakhs)\\n     2000 (number in lakhs)\\n        = ` 25'),\n",

When \\nthe book value of the share is higher than the par value, it is a healthy sign. The profits and \\naccumulated reserves lead to high book value. Book value may be less for firms having long \\ngestation period and when there are accumulated losses.\\n When the book value of the share is high, companies may issue bonus shares to the \\nexisting shareholders out of the reserves. Right issues also can bring down the book value \\nof the share.\\nDividend to Market Price\\nDividend is the regular income received by the shareholder. The shareholder would \\nlike to know the relationship between the market price and the dividend. Suppose “ A ” \\ncompany pays ` 4 per share and the market value is ` 50. Then\\n Dividend yield  =    Dividend per share      x  100\\n     Market price per share\\n      =  4 x 100 = 8%\\n     50\\n Even though the “ A ” company provides 40 percent dividend its actual yield is low \\nbecause of the high market price. Whenever companies plough back their profits to settle \\nthe loans or for expansion program, the yield would be low. At the same time, if the company \\ndistributes profits to shareholders the yield may be high. This may not be proper indicator. \\nThe earnings per share is treated as a better guide in investment decisions.\\nEarnings Per Share\\nEarnings per share is the earnings after tax divided by the number of common shares \\noutstanding.\\n EPS =     E A T\\n   Number of shares outstanding\\n \\n Lerner and Carleton have given a model for the EPS.\\n EPS =   (I – T) [R + (R – 1) L/E] E\\n   Number of common shares outstanding '),\n",

Most of the news \\npapers along with the stock price quotations give the P/E ratio too. The P/E ratio is the \\nmultiplying factor that the market is willing to offer to the company’s future earnings. In the \\n“ A ” company’s earnings per share is ` 6 and price ` 50, then:\\n Price – Earnings Ratio  = Market price per share\\n         Earnings per share\\n     = ` 50 =   8.33 times\\n      ` 6\\n The P/E of 8.33 means that the market is prepared to pay ` 8.33 for every rupee of \\nfuture earnings. The past performance is the base for the estimate. High P/E ratio indicates \\nhigh expectation of the market regarding the growth of future earnings of the company. The \\nP/E ratio has links with other financial parameters like dividend payout, dividend growth \\nrate and the cost of company’s funds. Large dividend payouts, high dividend growth rates \\nand low cost of funds will result in high P/E ratios.\\n The investors generally compare the P/E ratio of the company with that of the \\nindustry and market. A P/E ratio lower than industry means that the stock is underpriced. \\nInvestors should be careful n comparing the scrip’s P/E with the industry’s P/E because \\nsometimes, the industry P/E may be high due to overheated market. In such a situation, the \\nindustry’s P/E should be moderated to acceptable levels. The investor can also forecast the \\nfuture P/E ratio and compare it with the present P/E to assess the extent of under pricing \\nof the particular share. Forecast can be done by studying fundamental factors and applying \\nstatistical techniques using past P/E data. The comparison of the estimated P/E ratio with \\nthe actual P/E ratio leads to one of these three conclusions given below:\\n1. If the current P/E ratio is larger than the E (P/E) ratio, the stock is overpriced. It is \\nbetter to sell the shares before the fall in price.\\n2. If the current P/E ratio is smaller than the E (P/E) ratio, the stock is underpriced and \\nit could be a best buy with the expectation of the rise in price.\\n3. If the current P/E ratio equals the E(P/E) ratio, the stock is correctly priced. No \\nsignificant changes in prices are likely to occur.'),\n",

The dividend payout \\nhas increased. The earnings per share fluctuates. It has declined from 1997 and showed \\nslight improvement in the year 1999. \\n In spite of the dividends paid, the share prices languished around Ra 50. The specific \\ninformation that reveals the reason is the rate of return on assets. The rate of return on \\nassets has declined from 18.1 % in 1996 to 13.2% in 1999.\\nThe return on assets is the end result of the mixture of events that take place within \\nthe firm. The greater the return on assets, the higher the market value for the firm’s share, \\nother things remaining constant. Every firm tries to maximise the return on the assets, \\nbecause funds are employed in the farm of assets. The return on assets depends on the \\nturnover of assets into sales or intensity of utilization of assets in creating sales. Further, the \\nreturn on assets indicates the productivity of funds.\\nThe margin on sales has declined over the years.

Fundamental approach analyses the \\nshare prices on the basis of economic, industry and company statistics. If the price of the \\nshare is lower than its intrinsic value, investor buys it. But, if he finds the price of the \\nshare higher than the intrinsic value he sells and gets profit. The technical analyst mainly \\nstudies the stock price movement of the security market. If there is an uptrend in the price \\nmovement investor may purchase the scrip. With the onset of fall in price he may sell it and \\nmove from the scrip. Basically, technical analysts and the fundamental analysts aim at good \\nreturn on investment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 131}, page_content='128\\nTechnical Analysis\\nIt is a process of identifying trend reversals at an earlier stage to formulate the buying \\nand selling strategy. With the help of several indicators they analyzed the relationship \\nbetween price - volume and supply-demand for the overall market and the individual stock. \\nVolume is favorable on the upswing i.e. the number of shares traded is greater than before \\nand on the downside the number of shares traded dwindles If it is the other way round, \\ntrend reversals can be expected.\\nAssumptions\\n1) The market value of the scrip is determined by the interaction of supply and demand.\\n2) The market discounts everything. The price of the security quoted represents the \\nhopes, fears and inside information received by the market players. Inside information \\nregarding the issuing of bonus shares and right issues may support the prices. The \\nloss of earnings and information regarding the forthcoming labour problem may \\nresult in fall in price. These factors may cause a shift in demand and supply, changing \\nthe direction of trends.\\n3) The market always moves in trend. Except for minor deviations, the stock prices \\nmove in trends. The price may create definite patterns too. The trend may lie either \\nincreasing or decreasing. The trend continues for some time and then it reverses.\\n4) Any layman knows the fact that history repeats itself. It is true to the stock market \\nalso. In the rising market investors’ psychology have tip beats and they purchase \\nthe shares in greater volumes, driving the prices higher. At the same time, in the \\ndown trend they may be very eager to get out of the market by selling them and thus \\nplunging the share price further. The market technicians assume that past prices \\npredict the future.\\nHistory of Technical Analysis\\nThe technical analysis is based on the doctrine given by Charles H. Dow in 1884, in \\nthe Wall Street Journal. He wrote a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal A.J. Nelson, a \\nclose friend of Charles Dow formalized the Dow Theory for economic forecasting. \\nThe analysts used charts of individual stocks and moving averages in the early \\n1920’s. Later on, with the aid of calculators and computers, sophisticated techniques came \\ninto vogue.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='129\\nTechnical Tools\\nGenerally used technical tools are Dow Theory, volume of trading, short selling, odd \\nlot trading, bars and line charts, moving averages and oscillators. In this section some of the \\nabove mentioned tools are analyzed.\\nDow Theory\\nDow developed his theory to explain the movement of the indices of Dow Jones \\nAverages. He developed the theory on the basis of certain hypotheses. The first hypothesis \\nis that, no single individual or buyer can influence the major trend of the market. \\nHowever, an individual investor can affect the daily price movement by buying or \\nselling huge quantum of particular scrip. The intermediate price movement also can be \\naffected to a lesser degree by an investor.\\nHis second hypothesis is that the market discounts everything. Even natural \\ncalamities such as earthquake, plague and fire also get quickly discounted in the market. \\nThe Pokhran blast affected the share market for a short while and then the market returned \\nback to normalcy.\\nHis third hypothesis is that the theory is not infallible. It is not a tool to beat the \\nmarket but provides a way to understand it better. \\nThe theory According to Dow Theory the trend is divided into primary, intermediate \\nand short term trend. The primary trend may be the broad upward or downward movement \\nthat may last for a year or two. The intermediate trends are corrective movements, which \\nmay last for three weeks to three months. The primary trend may be interrupted by the \\nintermediate trend. The short term trend refers to the day to day price movement. It is also \\nknown as oscillators or fluctuations. These three types of trends are compared to tide, waves \\nand ripples of the sea.\\nTrend\\nTrend is the direction of movement. The share prices can either increase or fall or \\nremain flat. The three directions of the share price movements are called as rising, falling \\nand flat trends. The point to be remembered is that share prices do not rise or fall in a straight \\nline. Every rise or fall in price experiences a counter move. If a share price is increasing, the \\ncountermove will be a fall in price and vice-versa. The share prices move in zigzag manner.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='130\\nThe trend lines are straight lines drawn connecting either the tops or bottoms of the \\nshare price movement. To draw a trend line, the technical analyst should have at least two \\ntops or bottoms. The following figure shows the trend lines.\\nTrend Reversal \\nThe rise or fall in share price cannot go on forever. The share price movement may \\nreverse its direction. Before the change of direction, certain pattern in price movement \\nemerges. The change in the direction of the trend is shown by violation of the trend line. \\nViolation of the trend line means the penetration of the trend line. \\nIf a scrip price cuts the rising trend line from above, it is a violation of trend line \\nand signals the possibility of fall in price. Like – wise if the scrip pierces the trend line from \\nbelow this signal the rise in price.\\nPrimary Trend \\nThe security price trend may be either increasing or decreasing. When the market \\nexhibits the increasing trend, it is called bull market. The bull market shows three clear \\ncut peaks. Each peak is higher than the previous peak. The bottoms are also higher than \\nthe previous bottoms. The reactions following the peak used to halt before the previous \\nbottoms. \\nThe phases leading to the three peaks are revival, improvement in corporate profit \\nand speculation. The revival period encourages more and more investors to buy scrip’s their \\nexpectations about the future being high. In the second phase, increased profits of corporate \\nwould result in further price rise. In the third phase, prices advance due to inflation and \\nspeculation. The figure gives the three phases of bull market. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 134}, page_content='131\\nThe reverse is true with the bear market. Here, the first phase of fall starts with \\nthe abandonment of hopes. The chances of prices moving back to the previous high level \\nseemed to be low. This would result in the sale of shares. In the second phase, companies are \\nreporting lower profits and dividends. This would lead to selling pressure. \\nThe final phase is characterized 1’ the distress sale of shares. During the bear phase \\nof 1996, in the Bombay Stock Exchange more than 2/3 of stocks were inactive. Most of the \\nscrip’s were sold below their par values. The figure gives the bear market. Here the tops \\nand bottoms are lower than the previous ones. The bull and bear phases of the Indian stock \\nmarket are given in Figure.\\nThe Secondary Trend\\nThe secondary trend or the intermediate trend moves against the main trend and \\nleads to correction. In the bull market the secondary trend would result in the fall of \\nabout 33-66% of the earlier rise. In the bear market, the secondary trend carries the price '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 135}, page_content='132\\nupward and corrects the main trend. The correction ivu1d be 33% to 66% of the earlier fall. \\nIntermediate trend corrects the overbought and oversold condition. It provides the space \\nto the market. Compared to the time taken for the primary trend, secondary trend is swift \\nand quicker. \\nMinor Trends\\nMinor trends or tertiary moves are called random wriggles. They are simply the \\ndaily price fluctuations. Minor trend tries to correct the secondary trend movement. It \\nis better for the investors to concentrate on the primary or secondary trends than on the \\nminor trends. The chartist plots the scrip’s price or the market index each day to trace the \\nprimary and secondary trend.\\nSupport and Resistance Level\\nAnybody interested in the technical analysis should know the support and resistance \\nlevel. A support level exists at a price where considerable demand for that stock is expected \\nto prevent further fall in the price level. The fall in the price may be halted for the time \\nbeing or it may result even in price reversal. In the support level, demand for the particular \\nscrip is expected.\\nIn the resistance level, the supply of scrip would be greater than the demand and \\nfurther rise in price is prevented. The selling pressure is greater and the increase in price is \\nhalted for the time being.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 136}, page_content='133\\nSupport and resistance usually occur whenever the turnover of a large number of \\nshares tends to be concentrated at several price levels. When the stock touches a certain \\nlevel and then drops, this is called resistance and if the stock reaches down to certain level \\nand then rises there exists a support. The levels constantly switch from one to another i.e. \\nfrom support to resistance, or from resistance to support. The figures show the support and \\nresistance level.\\nThis can be explained numerically say, for example, if a scrip price hovers around \\n` 150 for some weeks then it may rise and reach ` 210. At this point the price halts and \\nthen falls back. The scrip keeps on falling back to around its original price ` 150 and halts. \\nThen it moves upward. In this case ` 150 becomes the support level. At this point, the scrip \\nis cheap and investors buy it and demand makes the price move upward. Whereas ` 210 \\nbecomes the resistance level, the price is high and there would be selling pressure resulting \\nin the decline of the price.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content='134\\nIf the scrip price reverses the support level and moves downward, it means that \\nthe selling pressure has overcome the potential buying pressure, signaling the possibility \\nof a further fall in the value of the scrip. It indicates the violation of the support level and \\nbearish market.\\nIf the scrip penetrates the previous top and moves above, it is the violation of \\nresistance level. At this point, buying pressure would be more than the selling pressure. \\nIf the scrip was to move above the double top or triple top formation, it indicates bullish \\nmarket.\\nThe support and the resistance level need not be formed only on tops or bottoms. \\nThey can be on the trend lines or gaps of the chart. Gaps are defined as those points or price \\nlevels where the scrip has not changed hands. In the rising or falling price level gaps are \\nformed. If the prices are in the upward move and the high of any day is lower than the next \\nday’s low, the gap is said to have occurred. \\nFor example, if the high price of the Instant Company’s scrip on March 1st is ` 200 \\nand on March 2nd low is 225, a gap is said to have occurred on the bar chart. This indicates \\nthat the stock is not traded between the level ` 200 and ` 225. This gap indicates further \\nrise in price level. Likewise in a falling price, a gap is formed if the low price on day 1 is \\nhigher than the high price of day 2. Suppose the low price on Monday is ` 150 and the high \\nprice on the Tuesday is ` 130, a gap is said to have occurred and indicates that there was no \\ntransaction between the level of ` 150 and ` 130.\\nIndicators\\nTechnical indicators are used to find out the direction of the overall market. The \\noverall market movements affect the individual share price. Aggregate forecasting is \\nconsidered to be more reliable than the individual forecasting. The indicators are price and \\nvolume of trade. The volume of trade is influenced by the behavior of price.\\nVolume of Trade \\nDow gave special emphasis on volume. Volume expands along with the bull market \\nand narrows down in the bear market. If the volume falls with rise in price or vice—versa, \\nit4s-a matter of concern for the investor and the trend may not persist for a longer time. \\nTechnical analyst used volume as an excellent method of confirming the trend. The market \\nis said to be bullish when small volume of trade and large volume of trade follow the fall in \\nprice and the rise in price.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 138}, page_content='135\\n Large rise in price or large fall in price leads to large increase in volume.\\nLarge volume with rise in price indicates bull market and the large volume with fall \\nin price indicates bear market.\\nIf the volumes decline for five consecutive days, then it will continue for another \\nfour days and the same is true in increasing volume.\\nThe Breadth of the Market\\nThe breadth of market is the term often used to study the advances and declines that \\nhave occurred in the stock market. Advances mean the number of shares whose prices have \\nincreased from the previous day’s trading. Declines indicate the number of shares whose \\nprices have fallen from the previous day’s trading.

Short sales refer to \\nthe selling of shares that are not owned. The bears are the short sellers who sell now in the \\nhope of purchasing at a lower price in the future to make profits. The short sellers have to \\ncover up their positions. Short positions of scrips are published in the business newspapers. \\nWhen the demand for a particular share increases, the outstanding short positions also \\nincrease and it indicates future rise of prices. These indications cannot be exactly correct, \\nbut they show the general situations.\\nShort sales of a particular month is selected and compared with the average daily \\nvolume of the preceding month. This ratio shows, how many days of trading it would take \\nto use up total short sales. If the ratio is less than 1, market is said to be weak or overbought \\nand a decline can be expected. The value between 1 and 0.5 shows neutral condition of the \\nmarket. Values above I indicate bullish trend and if it is above 2 the market is said to be \\noversold. At market tops, short selling is high and at market bottoms short selling is low.\\nOdd Lot Trading\\nShares are generally sold in a lot of hundred. Shares, sold in smaller lots, fewer than \\n100 are called odd lot. Such buyers and sellers are called odd lotters.Odd lot purchases to \\nodd lot sales (Purchase % Sales) is the odd lot index. The increase in odd lot purchase results \\nin an increase in the index. Relatively more selling leads to fall in the index. It is generally \\nconsidered that the professional investor is more informed and stronger than the odd lot -\\nters. When the professional investors dominate the market, the stock market is technically \\nstrong. If the odd lotters dominate the market, the market is considered to be technically \\nweak. The notion behind is that odd lot purchase is concentrated at the top of the market \\ncycle and selling at the bottom. High odd lot purchase forecasts fall in the market price and \\nlow purchases/sales ratios are presumed to occur toward the end of bear market.\\nSeveral studies have indicated that the odd lotters do not move into the market at \\nthe peak and move out at bottom. In October 1987, Newyork stock market crashed. During \\nthe weeks prior to the crash contrary to the odd lot theory, odd lotters were selling more \\nshares than they bought when market prices increased. After the crash, odd-lotters sensibly \\nbecame big buyers when stock prices were near their lows. These rational trading patterns \\ndefy the opinion about odd lot theory.'),\n",

The behavior of stock prices is studied with the \\nhelp of different methods such as fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental \\nanalysis seeks to evaluate the intrinsic value of securities by studying the fundamental \\nfactors affecting the performance of the economy, industry and companies. Technical \\nanalysis believes that the past behavior of stock prices gives an indication of the future \\nbehavior. It tries to study the patterns in stock price behavior through charts and predict the \\nfuture movement in prices. There is a third theory on stock price behavior which questions \\nthe assumptions of technical analysis.\\nThe basic assumption in technical analysis is that stock pie movement is quite orderly \\nand not random. The new theory questions this assumption. From the results of several \\nempirical studies on stock price movements, the advocates of the new theory assert that \\nshare price movements are random. The new theory came to be known as Random Walk \\nTheory because of its principal contention that share price movements represent a random \\nwalk rather than an orderly movement.\\nRandom Walk Theory\\nStock price behavior is explained by the theory in the following manner. A change \\noccurs in the price of a stock only because of certain changes in the economy, industry \\nor company. Information about these changes alters the stock prices immediately and \\nthe stock moves to a new level, either upwards or downwards, depending on the type of \\ninformation. This rapid shift to a new equilibrium level whenever new information is \\nreceived is recognition of the fact that all information which is known is fully reflected in \\nthe price of the stock. Further change in the price of the stock will occur only as a result \\nof some other new piece of information which was not available earlier. Thus, according \\nto this theory, changes in stock prices show independent behavior and are dependent on \\nthe new pieces of information that are received but within themselves are independent of \\neach other. Each price change is independent of other price changes because each change is \\ncaused by a new piece of information.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='157\\nThe basic premise in random walk theory is that the information on changes in the \\neconomy, industry and company performance is immediately and fully spread so that all \\ninvestors have full knowledge of the information. There is an instant adjustment in stock \\nprices either upwards or downwards. Thus, the current stock price fully reflects all available \\ninformation on the stock. Therefore, the price of a security two days ago can in no way \\nhelp in speculating the price two days later. The price of each day is independent. It may \\nbe unchanged, higher or lower from the previous price, but that depends on new pieces of \\ninformation being received each day.\\nThe random walk theory presupposes that the stock markets are so efficient \\nand competitive that there is immediate price adjustment. This is the result of good \\ncommunication system through which information can be spread almost anywhere in the \\ncountry instantaneously. Thus, the random walk theory is based on the hypothesis that \\nthe stock markets are efficient. Hence, this theory later came to be known as the efficient \\nmarket hypothesis (EMH) or the efficient market model.\\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis\\nThis hypothesis states that the capital market is efficient in processing information. \\nAn efficient capital market is one in which security prices equal their intrinsic values \\nat all times, and where most securities are correctly priced. The concept of an efficient \\ncapital market has been one of the dominant themes in academic literature since the 1960s. \\nAccording to Elton and Gruber, “when someone refers to efficient capital markets, they \\nmean that security prices fully reflect all available information” . ’ According to Eugene \\nFama,2 in an efficient market, prices fully reflect all available information. The prices of \\nsecurities observed at any time are based on correct evaluation of all information available \\nat that time.\\nThe efficient market model is actually concerned with the speed with which \\ninformation is incorporated into security prices. The technicians believe that past price \\nsequence contains information about the future price movements because they believe that \\ninformation is slowly incorporated in security prices. This gives technicians an opportunity \\nto earn excess returns by studying the patterns in price movements and trading accordingly.\\nFundamentalists believe that it may take several days or weeks before investors can \\nfully assess the impact of new information. As a consequence, the price may be volatile for a \\nnumber of days before it adjusts to a new level. This provides an opportunity to the analyst \\nwho has superior analytical skills to earn excess returns.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='158\\nThe efficient market theory holds the view that in an efficient market, new \\ninformation is processed and evaluated as it arrives and prices instantaneously adjust to \\nnew and correct levels. Consequently, an investor cannot consistently earn excess returns \\nby undertaking fundamental analysis or technical analysis. \\nForms of Market Efficiency\\nThe capital market is considered to be efficient in three different forms: the weak \\nform, semi-strong form and the strong form. Thus, the efficient market hypothesis has been \\nsubdivided into three forms, each dealing with a different type of information. The weak \\nform deals with the information regarding the past sequence of security price movements, \\nthe semi-strong form deals with the publicly available information, while the strong form \\ndeals with all information, both public and private (or inside).\\nThe different forms of efficient market hypothesis have been tested through several \\nempirical studies. The tests of the weak form hypothesis are essentially tests of whether all \\ninformation contained in historical prices of securities is fully reflected in current prices. \\nSemi-strong form tests of the efficient market hypothesis are tests of whether publicly \\navailable information is fully reflected in current stock prices. Finally, strong form tests of \\nthe efficient market hypothesis are tests of whether all information, both public and private \\n(or inside), is fully reflected in security prices and whether any type of investor is able to \\nearn excess returns.\\nEmpirical Tests of Weak Form Efficiency\\nThe weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) says that the current prices \\nof stocks already fully reflect all the information that is contained in the historical sequence \\nof prices. The new price movements are completely random. They are produced by new \\npieces of information and are not related or dependent on past price movements. Therefore, \\nthere is no benefit in studying the historical sequence of prices to gain abnormal returns \\nfrom trading in securities. This implies that technical analysis, which relies on charts of price \\nmovements in the past, is not a meaningful analysis for making abnormal trading profits.\\nThe weak form of the efficient market hypothesis is thus a direct repudiation of \\ntechnical analysis.\\nTwo approaches have been used to test the weak form of the efficient market hy -\\npothesis. One approach looks for statistically significant patterns in security price changes. \\nThe alternative approach searches for profitable short-term trading rules.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='159\\nSerial Correlation Test\\nSince the weak form EMH postulates independence between successive price changes, \\nsuch independence or randomness in stock price movements can be tested by calculating \\nthe correlation between price changes in one period and changes for the same stock in \\nanother period. The correlation coefficient can take on a value ranging from —1 to 1; a \\npositive number indicates a direct relation, a negative value implies an inverse relationship \\nand a value close to zero implies no relationship. Thus, if correlation coefficient is close to \\nzero, the price changes can be considered to be serially independent.\\nRun Test\\n The run test is another test used to test the randomness in stock price \\nmovements. In this test, the absolute values of price changes are ignored; oly the direction \\nof change is considered. An increase in price is represented by + signs. The decrease \\nis represented by – sign. When there is no change in prices, it is represented by ‘O’ . A \\nconsecutive sequence.of the same sign is considered as a run. \\nFor example, the sequence + + + — — — has two runs. In other words, a change of \\nsign indicates a new run. The sequence — — — + + 0 — — — + + + + has five runs; a run of \\nthree — ‘s, followed by a run of two + ‘s, another run of one 0, a fourth run of three — ‘s and \\na fifth run of four + ‘s. In a run test, the actual number of runs observed in a series of stock \\nprice movements is compared with the number of runs in a randomly generated number \\nseries. If no significant differences are found, then the security price changes are considered \\nto be random in nature.\\nFilter Tests\\nIf stock price changes are random in nature, it would be extremely difficult to develop \\nsuccessful mechanical trading systems. Filter tests have been developed as direct tests of \\nspecific mechanical trading strategies to examine their validity and usefulness.\\nIt is often believed that, as long as no new information enters the market, the price \\nfluctuates randomly within two barriers—one lower, and the other higher—around the \\nfair price. When new information comes into the market, a new equilibrium price will be \\ndetermined. If the news is favorable, then the price should move up to a new equilibrium \\nabove the old price. Investors will know that this is occurring when the price breaks through \\nthe old barrier. If investors purchase at this point, they will benefit from the price increase \\nto the new equilibrium level.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 163}, page_content='160\\nLikewise, if the news received is unfavorable, the price of the stock will decline to \\na lower equilibrium level. If investors sell the stock as it breaks the lower barrier, they will \\navoid much of the decline. Technicians set up trading strategies based on such patterns to \\nearn excess returns. \\nThe strategy is called a filter rule. The filter rule is usually stated in the following \\nway: Purchase the stock when it rises by x per cent from the previous low and sell it when \\nit declines by x per cent from the subsequent high. The filters may range from 1 per cent \\nto 50 per cent or more. The alternative to this active trading strategy is the passive buy and \\nhold strategy.\\nThe returns generated by trading according to the filter rule are compared with the \\nreturns earned by an investor following the buy and hold strategy. If trading with filters \\nresults in superior returns that would suggest the existence of patterns in price movements \\nand negate the weak form EMH.\\nDistribution Pattern\\nIt is a rule of statistics that the distribution of random occurrences will conform to \\na normal distribution. Then, if price changes are random, their distribution should also be \\napproximately normal. Therefore, the distribution of price changes can be studied to test \\nthe randomness or otherwise of stock price movements.\\nIn the 1960s the efficient market theory was known as the random walk theory. The \\nempirical studies regarding share price movements were testing whether prices followed a \\nrandom walk.\\nTwo articles by Roberts and Osborne, both published in 1959, stimulated a great \\ndeal of discussion of the new theory then called random walk theory.\\nRoberts’ study compared the movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an \\nAmerican stock market index) with the movement of a variable generated from a random \\nwalk process. He found that the random walk process produced patterns which were very \\nsimilar to those of the Dow Jones index.\\nOsborne’s study found a close resemblance between share price changes and the \\nrandom movement of small particles suspended in a solution, which is known in Physics \\nas the Brownian motion. Both the studies suggested that share price changes are random in \\nnature and that past prices had no predictive value.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 164}, page_content='161\\nDuring the 1960s there was an enormous growth in serial correlation testing. None \\nof these found any substantial linear dependence in price changes. Studies by Moore, Fama \\nand Hagerman and Richmond are some of the early studies in this area. Moore found an \\naverage serial correlation coefficient of — 0.06 for price changes measured over weekly \\nintervals. Fama’s study tested the serial correlation for the thirty stocks comprising the \\nDow Jones industrial average for the five years prior to 1962. The average serial correlation \\ncoefficient was found to be 0.03. Both the coefficients were not statistically different from \\nzero; thus both the studies supported the random walk theory.\\nFama also used run tests to measure dependency. The results again supported the \\nrandom walk theory. Many studies followed Moore’s and Fama’s work each of which used \\ndifferent databases. The results of these studies were much the same as those of Moore and \\nFama.\\nHagerman and Richmond conducted similar studies on securities traded in the \\n‘over- the-counter’ market and found little serial correlation. Serial correlation tests of \\ndependence have also been carried out in various other stock markets around the world. \\nThese have similarly revealed little or no serial correlation. \\nMuch research has also been directed towards testing whether mechanical trading \\nstrategies are able to earn above average returns. Many studies have tested the filter rules for \\nits ability to earn superior returns. Early American studies were those by Alexander, who \\noriginally advocated the filter strategy, and by Fama and Blume. There were similar studies \\nin the United Kingdom by Dryden and in Australia by Praetz. All these studies have found \\nthat filter strategies did not achieve above average returns. Thus, the results of empirical \\nstudies have been virtually unanimous in finding little or no statistical dependence and \\nprice patterns and this has corroborated the weak form efficient market hypothesis\\nEmpirical Tests of Semi-Strong Form Efficiency\\nThe semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis says that current prices \\nof stocks not only reflect all informational content of historical prices, but also reflect all \\npublicly available information about the company being studied. Examples of publicly \\navailable information are—corporate annual reports, company announcements, press \\nreleases, announcements of forthcoming dividends, stock splits, etc. The semi-strong \\nhypothesis maintains that as soon as the information becomes public the stock prices \\nchange and absorb the full information. In other words, stock prices instantaneously adjust \\nto the information that is received.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 165}, page_content='162\\nThe implication of semi-strong hypothesis is that fundamental analysts cannot \\nmake superior gains by undertaking fundamental analysis because stock prices adjust to \\nnew pieces of information as soon as they are received. There is no time gap in which \\na fundamental analyst can trade for superior gains. Thus, the semi-strong hypothesis \\nrepudiates fundamental analysis.\\nSemi-strong form tests deal with whether or not security prices fully reflect all \\npublicly available information. These tests attempt to establish whether share prices react \\nprecisely and quickly to new items of information. If prices do not react quickly and \\nadequately, then an opportunity exists for investors or analysts to earn excess returns by \\nusing this information. Therefore, these tests also attempt to find if analysts are able to earn \\nsuperior returns by using publicly available information.\\nThere is an enormous amount and variety of public information. Semi-strong form \\ntests have been performed with respect to many different types of information. Much of the \\nmethodology used in semi-strong form tests has been introduced by Fama, Fisher, Jensen \\nand Roll. Theirs was the first of the studies that were directly concerned with the testing \\nof the semi-strong form of EMH. Subsequent to their study, a number of refinements have \\nbeen developed in the test procedure.\\nThe general methodology followed in these studies has been to take an economic \\nevent and measure its impact on the share price. The impact is measured by taking the \\ndifference between the actual return and expected return on a security. The expected return \\non a security is generally estimated by using the market model (or single index model) \\nsuggested by William Sharpe. The model used for estimating expected returns is the \\nfollowing:\\n R i  =   ai + biRm + ei\\nWhere\\n R i =  Return on security i.\\n R m =  Return on a market index.\\n a i& bi =  Constants.\\n e i =  Random error.\\nThis analysis is known as Residual analysis. The positive difference between the \\nactual return and the expected return represents the excess return earned on a security. \\nIf the excess return is close to zero, it implies that the price reaction following the public '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='163\\nannouncement of information is immediate and the price adjusts to a new level almost \\nimmediately. Thus, the lack of excess returns would validate the semi-strong form EMH.\\nMajor studies on the impact of capitalization issues such as stock splits and stock \\ndividends have been conducted in the United States by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll \\nand Johnson, in Canada by Finn, and in the United Kingdom by Firth. All these studies \\nfound that the market adjusted share prices instantaneously and accurately for the new \\ninformation. Both Pettit and Watts have investigated the market’s reaction to dividend \\nannouncements. They both found that all the price adjustment was over immediately after \\nthe announcement and thus, the market had acted quickly in evaluating the information.\\nOther items of information whose impact on share prices have been tested include \\nannouncements of purchase and sale of large blocks of shares of a company, takeovers, \\nannual earnings of companies, quarterly earnings, accounting procedure changes, and \\nearnings estimates made by company officials. All these studies which made use of the \\nResidual analysis approach, showed the market to be relatively efficient.\\nBall and Brown tested the stock market’s ability to absorb the informational \\ncontent of reported annual earnings per share information. They found that companies \\nwith good earnings report experienced price increase in stock, while companies with bad \\nearnings report experienced decline in stock prices. But surprisingly, about 85 per cent \\nof the informational content of the earnings announcements was reflected in stock price \\nmovements prior to the release of the actual earnings figure. The market seems to adjust \\nto new information rapidly with much of the impact taking place in anticipation of the \\nannouncement.\\nJoy, Litzenberger and McEnally tested the impact of quarterly earnings \\nannouncements on the stock price adjustment mechanism. Some of their results, however, \\ncontradicted the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. They found that the \\nfavorable information contained in published quarterly earnings reports was not always \\ninstantaneously adjusted in stock prices. This may suggest that the market does not adjust \\nshare prices equally well for all types of information.\\nBy way of summary it may be stated that a great majority of the semi- strong \\nefficiency tests provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis; however, there have \\nbeen some contradictory results too. Most of the reported results show that stock prices do \\nadjust rapidly to announcements of new information and that investors are typically unable \\nto utilize this information to earn consistently above average returns.'),\n",

The \\nstrong form of the efficient market hypothesis maintains that the current security prices \\nreflect all information both publicly available information as well as private or inside \\ninformation. This implies that no information, whether public or inside, can be used to \\nearn superior returns consistently.\\nThe directors of companies and other persons occupying senior management \\npositions within companies have access to much information that is not available to the \\ngeneral public. This is known as inside information. Mutual funds and other professional \\nanalysts who have large research facilities may gather much private information regarding \\ndifferent stocks on their own. These are private information not available to the investing \\npublic at large.\\nThe strong form efficiency tests involve two types of tests. The first type of tests \\nattempt to find whether those who have access to inside information have been able to utilize \\nprofitably such inside information to earn excess returns. The second type of tests examine \\nthe performance of mutual funds and the recommendations of investment analysts to see \\nif these have succeeded in achieving superior returns with the use of private information \\ngenerated by them.\\nJaffe, Lorie and Niederhoffer studied the profitability of insider trading (i.e. the \\ninvestment activities of people who had inside information on companies). They found \\nthat insiders earned returns in excess of expected returns. Although there have been only \\na few empirical studies on the profitability of using inside information, the results show, as \\nexpected, that excess returns can be made. These results indicate that markets are probably \\nnot efficient in the strong form.\\nMany studies have been carried out regarding the performance of American mutual \\nfunds using fairly sophisticated evaluation models. All the major studies have found that \\nmutual funds did no better than randomly constructed portfolios of similar risk. Firth \\nstudied the performance of Unit Trusts in the United Kingdom during the period 1965— \\n75. He also found that unit trusts did not outperform the market index for their given \\nlevels of risk. A small research has been conducted into the profitability of investment \\nrecommendations by investment analysts. Such studies suggest that few analysts or firms of \\nadvisers can claim above average success with their forecasts.'),\n",

Inside information can be used to earn above average returns.\\n2. Mutual funds and investment analysts have not been able to earn superior returns by \\nusing their private information.\\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that the strong form hypothesis is invalid as regards \\ninside information, but valid as regards private information other than inside information.\\nEMH  Vs. Fundamental and Technical Analyses\\nThere are three broad theories concerning stock price movements. These are the \\nfundamental analysis, technical analysis and efficient market hypothesis. Fundamental \\nanalysts believe that by analyzing key economic and financial variables they can estimate \\nthe intrinsic worth of a security and then determine what investment action to take. \\nFundamental analysis seeks to identify under priced securities and overpriced securities. \\nTheir investment strategy consists in buying under priced securities and selling overpriced \\nsecurities, thereby earning superior returns.\\nA technical analyst maintains that fundamental analysis is unnecessary. He believes \\nthat history repeats itself. Hence, he tries to predict future movements in share prices by \\nstudying the historical patterns in share price movements.\\nThe efficient market hypothesis is expressed in three forms. The weak form of the \\nEMH directly contradicts technical analysis by maintaining that past prices and past price \\nchanges cannot be used to forecast future price changes because successive price changes \\nare independent of each other. The semi-strong form of the EMH contradicts fundamental \\nanalysis to some extent by claiming that the market is efficient in the dissemination and \\nprocessing of information and hence, publicly available information cannot be used \\nconsistently to earn superior investment returns.\\nThe strong form of the EMH maintains that not only is publicly available information \\nuseless to the investor or analyst but all information is useless.\\nEven though the EMH repudiates both fundamental analysis and technical analysis, \\nthe market is efficient precisely because of the organized and systematic efforts of thousands \\nof analysts undertaking fundamental and technical analysis. Thus, the paradox of efficient \\nmarket hypothesis is that both fundamental and technical analyses are required to make the \\nmarket efficient and thereby validate the hypothesis.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content='166\\nCompetitive Market Hypothesis\\nAn efficient market has been defined as one where share prices always fully reflect \\navailable information on companies. In practice, no existing stock market is perfectly \\nefficient. There are evident shortcomings in the pricing mechanism. Often, the complete body \\nof knowledge about a company’s prospects is not publicly available to market participants. \\nFurther, the available information would not be always interpreted in a completely accurate \\nfashion. The research studies on EMH have shown that price changes are random or \\nindependent and hence unpredictable. The prices are also seen to adjust quickly to new \\ninformation. Whether the price adjustments are correct and accurate, reflecting correctly \\nand accurately the meaning of publicly available information is difficult to determine. \\nAll that can be validly concluded is that prices are set in a very competitive market, \\nbut not necessarily in an efficient market. This competitive market hypothesis provides \\nscope for earning superior returns by undertaking security analysis and following portfolio \\nmanagement strategies. \\nMarket Inefficiencies\\nMany studies have proved the prevalence of the market efficiency. At the same \\ntime, several studies contradict the concept of market efficiency. For example, the studies \\nconducted Joy, Lichtenberger and Mc. Enally over the period of 1963-1968 gave different \\nresults. The authors have examined the quarterly earnings of the stock prices. The earning \\nof one quarter was compared with the same quarter of the previous year. If the current year’s \\nearnings were 40% or more than the earnings for the same quarter in the previous year, the \\nearnings were classified as good earnings than anticipated. If the current quarter’s earnings \\nwere below 40% of the previous year’s earnings, they are classified as bad than expected.\\nThen the abnormal returns were calculated from 13 weeks prior to the announcement \\nof the earnings to 26 weeks after the announcement of the earnings. The stocks whose earn -\\nings are substantially greater than anticipated gave positive abnormal returns. The stocks \\nwhose earnings are below the anticipated earnings generated negative abnormal returns.\\nThe author’s main claim is that after the announcement of the earnings, stocks \\nthat reported earnings substantially above those of the previous year continued to earn \\npositive abnormal returns. According to the study, the investors could have earned positive \\nabnormal returns of around 6.5 per cent over the next 26 weeks simply by buying stocks \\nthat have reported earnings 40% above the previous quarterly earnings. Meanwhile for \\nthose stocks with earnings substantially below the previous year, the cumulative average '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 170}, page_content='167\\nabnormal return remained relatively stable. This shows evidence against the semi-strong \\nmarket hypothesis because it states that when the information is made public the analyst \\ncould not earn abnormal profits. A study made by C.P . Jones, R. S. Randleman for the \\nperiod 1971-1980 had also given similar results to those of JLM.\\nLow PE effect many studies have provided evidences that stocks with low price \\nearnings ratios yield higher returns than stocks with higher PEs. This is known as low PE \\neffect. A study made by Basu in 1977 was risk adjusted return and even after the adjustment \\nthere was excess return in the low price-earnings stocks. If historical information of P/E \\nratios is useful to the investor in obtaining superior stock returns, the validity of the semi-\\nstrong form of market hypothesis is questioned. His results stated that low P/E portfolio \\nexperienced superior returns relative to the market and high P/E portfolio performed in \\nan inferior manner relative to the overall market. Since his result directly contradicts semi-\\nstrong form of efficient market hypothesis, it is considered to be important.\\nSmall firm effect the theory of the small firm effect maintains that investing in small \\nfirms (those with low capitalization) provides superior risk adjusted returns. Bans found \\nthat the size of the firm has been highly correlated with returns. Bans examined historical \\nmonthly returns of NYSE common stocks for the period 1931-1975. He formed portfolios \\nconsisting of 10 smallest firms and the 10 largest firms and computed the average return for \\nthese portfolios. The small firm portfolio has outperformed the large firm portfolio.\\nSeveral other studies have confirmed the existence of a small firm effect. The size \\neffect has given rise to the doubts regarding the risk associated with small firms. The risk \\nassociated with them is underestimated and they do not trade as frequently as the those \\nof the large firms. Correct measurement of risk and return of small portfolios tends to \\neliminate at least 50% of the small firm effect.\\nThe weekend effect French in his study had examined the returns generated by the \\nStandard and poor Index for each day of the week. Stock prices tend to rise all week long to \\na peak on Fridays. The stocks are traded on Monday at reduced prices, before they begin the \\nnext week’s price rise. Buying on Monday and selling on Friday from 1953 to 1977 would \\nhave generated average annual return 3.4% while simple buy and hold would have yielded \\n5.5% annual return. If the transaction costs are taken into account, the naive buy and hold \\nstrategy would have provided higher return. Y et the knowledge of the weekend effect is \\nstill of v Purchases planned on Thursday or Friday can be delayed until Monday, while sale \\nplanned for Monday can b delayed until the end of the week. The weekend effect is a small \\nbut significant deviation from perfectly random price movements and violates the weekly \\nefficient market hypothesis.'),\n",

The future return \\nexpected from a security is variable and this variability of returns is termed risk. It is rare \\nto find investors investing their entire wealth in a single security. This is because most \\ninvestors have an aversion to risk. It is hoped that if money is invested in several securities \\nsimultaneously, the loss in one will be compensated by the gain in others. Thus, holding \\nmore than one security at a time is an attempt to spread and minimize risk by not putting \\nall our eggs in one basket.\\nMost investors thus tend to invest in a group of securities rather than a single security. \\nSuch a group of securities held together as an investment is what is known as a portfolio. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content='172\\nThe process of creating such a portfolio is called diversification. It is an attempt to spread \\nand minimize the risk in investment. This is sought to be achieved by holding different \\ntypes of securities across different industry groups.\\nFrom a given set of securities, any number of portfolios can be constructed. A \\nrational investor attempts to find the most efficient of these portfolios. The efficiency of \\neach portfolio can be evaluated only in terms of the expected return and risk of the portfolio \\nas such. Thus, determining the expected return and risk of different portfolios is a primary \\nstep in portfolio management. This step is designated as portfolio analysis.\\nExpected Return of a Portfolio\\nAs a first step in portfolio analysis, an investor needs to specify the list of securities \\neligible for selection or inclusion in the portfolio.

For calculating the risk of a portfolio of securities, the \\nriskiness of each security within the context of the overall portfolio has to be considered. \\nThis depends on their interactive risk, i.e. how the returns of a security move with \\nthe returns of other securities in the portfolio and contribute to the overall risk of the \\nportfolio.\\nCovariance is the statistical measure that indicates the interactive risk of a security \\nrelative to others in a portfolio of securities. In other words, the way security returns vary \\nwith each other affects the overall risk of the portfolio.\\nThe covariance between two securities X and Y may be calculated using the following \\nformula:\\n                   [Rx – Rx][Ry - Ry] Covxy =          \\nN\\n    \\nWhere:\\n Cov xy =  Covariance between x and y. \\n R x =  Return of security x.\\n R y =  Return of security y\\n R x =  Expected or mean return of security x.\\n R y =  Expected or mean return of security y. \\n N  =  Number of observations.\\n  n\\n  ∑   i = 1'),\n",

Had \\nthey been negatively correlated, the portfolio risk would have continued to decline as \\nportfolio size increased. Thus, in practice, the benefits of diversification are limited.\\nThe total risk of an individual security comprises two components, the market \\nrelated risk called systematic risk and the unique risk of that particular security called \\nunsystematic risk. By combining securities into a portfolio the unsystematic risk specific \\nto different securities is cancelled out. Consequently, the risk of the portfolio as a whole \\nis reduced as the size of the portfolio increases. Ultimately when the size of the portfolio \\nreaches a certain limit, it will contain only the systematic risk of securities included in the \\nportfolio. The systematic risk, however, cannot be eliminated. Thus, a fairly large portfolio \\nhas only systematic risk and has relatively little unsystematic risk.

Portfolio means \\nthe group of assets an investor owns. The assets may vary from stocks to different types \\nof bonds. Some times the portfolio may consist of securities of different industries. When \\ndifferent assets are added to the portfolio, the total risk tends to decrease. In the case of \\ncommon stocks, diversification reduces the unsystematic risk or unique risk. Analysts \\nopine that if 15 stocks are added in a portfolio of the investor, the unsystematic risk can be \\nreduced to zero. But at the same time if the number exceeds 15, additional risk reduction \\ncannot be gained. But diversification cannot reduce systematic or undiversifiable risk.\\nThe naive kind of diversification is known as simple diversification.

The reason behind this \\nis that the unsystematic price fluctuations are not correlated with the market’s systematic \\nfluctuations.

The investor \\ngets more satisfaction or more utility in X + 1 rupees than from X rupee. \\nIf he is allowed to choose between two certain investments, he would always like to \\ntake the one with larger outcome. Thus, utility increases with increase in return.\\nThe utility function makes certain assumptions about an investors’ taste for risk. \\nThe investors are categorised into risk averse, risk neutral and risk seeking investor. All the \\nthree types can be explained with the help of a fair gamble.\\nIn a fair gamble which cost ` 1, the on are A and B events. A event will yield ` 2. \\nOccurrence of B event is a dead loss i.e 0. The chance of occurrence of both the events are \\n50% and 50%. \\nThe expected value of investment is (1/2) 2 + 1/2 (0) = Rel> the expected value of the \\ngamble is exactly equal to cost. Hence, it is a fair gamble. The position of the investor may, \\nbe improved or hurt by undertaking the gamble.\\nRisk avertor rejects a fair gamble because the disutility of the loss is greater for him \\nthan the utility of an equivalent gain. Risk neutral investor means that he is indifferent to \\nwhether a fair gamble is undertaken or not.\\nThe risk seeking investor would select a fair gamble i.e. he would choose to invest. \\nThe expected utility of investment is higher than the expected utility of not investing. These \\nthree different types of investors are shown in figure.\\nThe curves ABC are three different slopes of utility curves. The upward sloping \\ncurve A shows increasing marginal utility. The straight line B shows constant utility, and \\ncurve C shows diminishing marginal utility. The constant utility, a linear function means \\ndoubling of returns would double the utility and it indicates risk neutral situation. \\nThe increasing marginal utility suggests that the utility increases more than \\nproportion to increase in return and shows the risk lover.

The return from the risk free asset is \\ncertain and the standard deviation of the return is nil. The relationship between the rate of \\nreturn of the risk free asset and risky asset is zero. These types of assets are usually fixed \\nincome securities. But fixed income securities issued by private institutions have the chance \\nof default.

The process of blending together the broad asset classes so as to obtain optimum \\nreturn with minimum risk is called portfolio construction. Diversification of investments \\nhelps to spread risk over many assets. A diversification of securities gives the assurance of \\nobtaining the anticipated return on the portfolio. In a diversified portfolio, some securities \\nmay not perform as expected, but others may exceed the expectation and making the actual \\nreturn of the portfolio reasonably close to the anticipated one. Keeping a portfolio of single \\nsecurity may lead to a greater livelihood of the actual return somewhat different from that of \\nthe expected return. Hence, it is a common practice to diversify securities in the portfolio.\\nApproaches in Portfolio Construction\\nCommonly, there are t approaches in the construction of the portfolio of securities \\nviz, traditional approach and Markowitz efficient frontier approach. In the traditional \\napproach, investor’s needs in terms of income and capital appreciation re evaluated and \\nappropriate securities are selected to meet the needs of the investor. The common practice \\nin the traditional approach is to evaluate the entire financial plan of the individual. In the \\nmodem approach, portfolios are constructed to maximize the expected return for a given \\nlevel of risk. It views portfolio construction in terms of the expected return and the risk \\nassociated with obtaining the expected return.\\nThe Traditional Approach\\nThe traditional approach basically deals with two major decisions. They are:\\n(a)  Determining the objectives of the portfolio.\\n(b)  Selection of securities to be included in the portfolio.\\nNormally, this is carried out in four to six steps. Before formulating the objectives, the \\nconstraints of the investor should be analysed. Within the given frame work of constraints, \\nobjectives are formulated. Then based on the objectives, securities are selected. After that, \\nthe risk and return of the securities should be studied. The investor has to assess the major \\nrisk categories that he or she is trying to minimize. Compromise on risk and non-risk '),\n",

Finally relative portfolio weights are assigned to securities \\nlike bonds, stocks and debentures and then diversification is carried out. The flow chart 4.5 \\nexplains this\\nAnalysis of Constraints \\nThe constraints normally discussed are: income needs, liquidity time harizon, safety, \\ntax considerations and the temperament.\\nIncome Needs \\nThe income needs depend on the need for income in constant rupees and current \\nrupees. The need for income in current rupees arises from the investor’s need to meet all \\nor part of the living expenses. At the same time inflation may erode the purchasing power, \\nthe investor may like to offset the effect of the inflation and so, needs income in constant \\nrupees.\\nSteps In Traditional Approach\\nAnalysis of constraints\\nDetermination of Objectives\\nSelection of Portfolio\\nBond and Common Stock\\nAssessment of risk and return\\nDiversification\\n(a) Need for current\\n \\nIncome The investor should establish the income which the portfolio should \\ngenerate. The current income need depends upon the entire current financial plan of the \\ninvestor. The expenditure required to maintain a certain level of standard of living and \\nthe other entire income generating source should be determined. Once this information is \\narrived at, it is possible to decide how much income must be provided for the port1olio of \\nsecurities.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 213}, page_content='210\\n(b) Need for Constant Income \\nInflation reduces the purchasing power of the money. Hence, the investor estimates \\nthe impact of inflation on his estimated stream of income and tries to build a portfolio \\nwhich could offset the effect of inflation. Funds should be invested in such securities where \\nincome from them might increase at a rate that would offset the effect of inflation. The \\ninflation or purchasing power risk must be recognized but this does not pose a serious \\nconstraint on portfolio if growth stocks are selected.\\nLiquidity \\nLiquidity need of the investment is highly individualistic of the investor. If the \\ninvestor prefers to have high liquidity then funds should be invested in high quality short \\nterm debt maturity issues such as money market funds, commercial papers and shares that \\nare widely traded. Keeping, the funds in shares that are poorly traded or stocks in closely \\nheld business and real estate lack liquidity. The investor should plan his cash drain and the \\nneed for net cash inflows during the investment period.\\nSafety of the Principal \\nAnother serious constraint to be considered by the investor is the safety of the \\nprincipal value at the time of liquidation. Investing in bonds and debentures is safer than \\ninvesting in the stocks. Even among the stocks, the money should be invested in regularly \\ntraded companies of longstanding. Investing money in the unregistered finance companies \\nmay not provide adequate safety\\nTime Horizon \\nTime horizon is the investment-planning period of the individuals. This varies from \\nindividual to individual. Individual’s risk and return preferences are often described in \\nterms of his “life cycle” . The stages of the life cycle determine the nature of investment. The \\nfirst stage is the early career situation. At the career starting point assets are lesser than \\ntheir liabilities. More goods are purchased on credit. His house might have been built with \\nthe help of housing loan scheme. His major asset may be the house he owns. His priority \\ntowards investments may be in the form of savings for liquidity purposes. He takes life \\ninsurance for protecting him from unforeseen events like death and accidents and then he \\nthinks of the investments. The investor is young at this stage and has long horizon of life \\nexpectancy with possibilities of growth in income, he can invest in high-risk and growth \\noriented investments.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 214}, page_content='211\\nThe other stage of the time horizon is the mid-career individual. At this stage, his \\nassets are larger than his liabilities. Potential pension benefits are available to him. By this \\ntime he establishes his investment program. The time horizon before him is not as long as \\nthe earlier stage and he wants to protect his capital investment. He may wish to reduce the \\noverall risk exposure of the portfolio but, he may continue to invest in high risk and high \\nreturn securities.\\nThe final stage is the late career or the retirement stage. Here, the time horizon of \\nthe investment is very much limited. He needs stable income and once he retires, the size of \\nincome he needs from investment also increases. In this stage, most of his loans are repaid by \\nhim and his assets far exceed the liabilities. His pension and life insurance programmes are \\ncompleted by him. He shifts his investment to low return and low risk category investments, \\nbecause safety of the principal is given priority. Mostly he likes to have lower risk with \\nhigh interest or dividend paying component to be included in his portfolio. Thus, the time \\nhorizon puts restrictions on the investment decisions.\\nTax Consideration \\nInvestors in the income tax paying group consider the tax concessions they could \\nget from their investments. For all practical purpose, they would like to reduce the taxes. \\nFor income tax purpose, interests and dividends are taxed under the head “income from \\nother sources” . The capital appreciation is taxed under the head “capital gains” only when \\nthe investor sells the securities and realises the gain. The tax is then at a concessional rate \\ndepending on the period for which the asset has been held before being sold. From the tax \\npoint of view, the form in which the income is received i. e. interest, dividend, short term \\ncapital gains and long term capital gains are important. If the investor cannot avoid taxes, \\nhe can delay the taxes. Investing in government bonds and NSC can avoid taxation. This \\nconstraint makes the investor to include the items which will reduce the tax.\\nTemperament \\nThe temperament of the investor himself poses a constraint on framing his \\ninvestment objectives. Some investors are risk lovers or takers who would like to take up \\nhigher risk even for low return while some investors are risk averse, who may not be willing \\nto undertake higher level of risk even for higher level of return. The risk neutral investors \\nmatch the return and the risk. For example, if a stock is highly volatile in nature then the \\nstock may be selling in a range of ` l00 - 200 and returns may fluctuate. Investors who are \\nrisk averse would find it disturbing and do not have the temperament to invest in this stock. \\nHence, the temperament of the investor plays an important role in setting the objectives.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 215}, page_content='212\\nDetermination of Objectives\\nPortfolios have the common objective of financing present and future expenditures \\nfrom a large pool of assets. The return that the investor requires and the degree of risk he is \\nwilling to take depend upon the constraints. The objectives of portfolio range from income \\nto capital appreciation. The common objectives are stated below\\n => Current income\\n => Growth in income\\n => Capital appreciation\\n => Preservation of capital\\nThe investor in general would like to achieve all the four objectives; nobody \\nwould like to lose his investment. But, it is not possible to achieve all the four objectives \\nsimultaneously. If the investor aims at capital appreciator, he should include risky securities \\nwhere there is an equal likelihood of losing the capital. Thus, there is a conflict among the \\nobjectives.\\nSelection of Portfolio\\nThe selection of portfolio depends on the various objectives of the investor. The \\nselections of portfolio under different objectives are dealt subsequently.\\nObjectives and Asset Mix\\nIf the main objective is getting adequate amount of current income, sixty per cent of \\nthe investment is made on debts and 40 per cent on equities. The proportions of investments \\non debt and equity differ according to the individual’s preferences. Money is invested \\nin short term debt and fixed income securities. Here the growth of income becomes the \\nsecondary objective and stability of principal amount may become the third. Even within \\nthe debt portfolio, the funds invested in short term bonds depends on the need for stability \\nof principal amount in comparison with the stability of income. If the appreciation of capital \\nis given third priority, instead of short term debt the investor opts for long term debt. The \\nmaturity period may not be a constraint.\\nGrowth and Income and Asset Mix\\nHere the investor requires a certain percentage of growth in the e received from \\nhis investment. The investor’s portfolio may consist of 60 to 100 percent equities and 0 to '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 216}, page_content='213\\n40 percent debt instrument. The debt portion of the portfolio may consist of concession \\nregarding tax exemption. Appreciation of principal amount is given third priority. For \\nexample computer software, hardware and non-conventional energy producing company \\nshares provide good possibility of growth in dividend.\\nCapital Appreciation and Asset Mix\\nCapital appreciation and asset mix Capital appreciation means that the value of the \\noriginal investment increases over the years. Investment in real estate’s like land and house \\nmay provide a faster rate of capital appreciation but they lack liquidity. In the capital market, \\nthe values of the shares are much higher than their original issue prices. For example Satyam \\nComputers, share value was ` 306 in April 1998 but in October 1999 the value was ` 1658. \\nLikewise, several examples can be cited. The market capitalisation also has increased. Next \\nto real assets, the stock markets provide best opportunity for capital appreciation. If the \\ninvestor’s objective is capital appreciation, 90 to 100 per cent of his portfolio may consist of \\nequities and 0-10% of debts. The growth of income becomes the secondary objective.\\nSafety of Principal and Asset Mix \\nUsually, the risk averse investors are very particular about the stability of principal. \\nAccording to the life cycle theory, people in the third stage of life also give more importance \\nto the safety of the principal. All the investors have this objective in their mind. No one \\nlikes to lose his money invested in different assets. But, the degree may differ. The investor’s \\nportfolio may consist more of debt instruments and within the debt portfolio more would \\nbe on short term debts.\\nRisk and Return Analysis \\nThe traditional approach to portfolio building has some basic assumptions. First, \\nthe individual prefers larger to smaller returns from securities. To achieve this goal, the \\ninvestor has to take more risk. The ability to achieve higher returns is dependent upon \\nhis ability to judge risk and his ability to take specific risks. The risks are namely interest \\nrate risk, purchasing power risk, financial risk and market risk. The investor analyses the \\nvarying degrees of risk and constructs his portfolio. At first, he establishes the minimum \\nincome that he must have to avoid hardships under most adverse economic condition and \\nthen he decides risk of loss of income that can be tolerated. The investor makes a series \\nof compromises on risk and non-risk factors like taxation and marketability after he has \\nassessed the major risk categories, which he is trying to minimize.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 217}, page_content='214\\nDiversification\\n Once the asset mix is determined and the risk and return are analysed, the final \\nstep is the diversification of portfolio. Financial risk can be minimized by commitments \\nto top-quality bonds, but these securities offer poor resistance to inflation. Stocks provide \\nbetter inflation protection than bonds but are more vulnerable to financial risks. Good \\nquality convertibles may balance the financial risk and purchasing power risk. According to \\nthe investor’s need for income and risk tolerance level portfolio is diversified. In the bond \\nportfolio, the investor has to strike a balance between the short term and long term bonds. \\nShort term fixed income securities offer more risk to income and long term fixed income \\nsecurities offer more risk to principal. In the stock portfolio, he has to adopt the following \\nsteps which are shown in the following figure: \\nSelection of Industries\\nSelection of Companies in the Industry\\nDetermining the size of participation\\n The investor has to select the industries appropriate to his investment objectives. \\nEach industry corresponds to specific goals of the investor. The sales of some industries like \\ntwo wheelers and steel tend to move in tandem with the business cycle, the housing industry \\nsales move counter cyclically. If regular income is the criterion then industries, which resist \\nthe trade cycle should be selected. Likewise, the investor has to select one or two companies \\nfrom each industry. The selection of the company depends upon its growth, yield, expected \\nearnings, past earnings, expected price earning ratio, dividend and the amount spent \\non research and development. Selecting the best company is widely followed by all the \\ninvestors but this depends upon the investors’ knowledge and perceptions regarding the \\ncompany. The final step in this process is to determine the number of shares of each stock \\nto be purchased. This involves determining the number of different stocks that is required \\nto give adequate diversification. Depending upon the size of the portfolio, equal amount is \\nallocated to each stock. The investor has to purchase round lots to avoid transaction costs.\\nModern Approach\\n The traditional approach is a comprehensive financial plan for the individual. It \\ntakes into account the individual needs such as housing, life insurance and pension plans. \\nBut these types of financial planning approaches are not done in the Markowitz approach. \\nMarkowitz gives more attention to the process of selecting the portfolio. His planning can '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 218}, page_content='215\\nbe applied more in the selection of common stocks portfolio than the bond portfolio. The \\nstocks are not selected on the basis of need for income or appreciation. But the selection is \\nbased on the risk and return analysis. Return includes the market return and dividend. The \\ninvestor needs return and it may be either in the form of market return or dividend. They \\nare assumed to be indifferent towards the form of return.\\n From the list of stocks quoted at the Bombay Stock Exchange or at any other regional \\nstock exchange, the investor selects roughly some group of shares say of 10 or 15 stocks. \\nFor these stocks’ expected return and risk would be calculated. The investor is assumed to \\nhave the objective of maximizing the expected return and minimising the risk. Further, it \\nis assumed that investors would take up risk in a situation when adequately rewarded for \\nit. This implies that individuals would prefer the portfolio of highest expected return for \\na given level of risk. In the modern approach, the final step is asset allocation process that \\nis to choose the portfolio that meets the requirement of the investor. The risk taker i.e. \\nwho are willing to accept a higher probability of risk for getting the expected return would \\nchoose high risk portfolio. Investor with lower tolerance for risk would choose low level risk \\nportfolio. The risk neutral investor would choose the medium level risk portfolio.\\nManaging the Portfolio \\n After establishing the asset allocation, the investor has to decide how to manage \\nthe portfolio over time. He can adopt passive approach or active approach towards the \\nmanagement of the portfolio. In the passive approach the investor would maintain the \\npercentage allocation for asset classes and keep the security holdings within its place over \\nthe established holding period. In the active approach the investor continuously assess the \\nrisk and return of the securities within the asset classes and changes them. He would be \\nstudying the risks (1) market related (2) group related and (3) security specific and changes \\nthe components of the portfolio to suit his objectives.\\nConstruction of the Optimal Portfolio\\n After determining the securities to be selected, the portfolio manager should find \\nout how much should be invested in each security. The percentage of funds to be invested \\nin each security can be estimated as follows:\\n'),\n",

It is a model of linear general equilibrium return. In the \\nCAPM theory, the required rate return of an asset is having a linear relationship with asset’s \\nbeta value i.e. undiversifiable or systematic risk.\\nAssumptions\\n1. An individual seller or buyer cannot affect the price of a stock. This assumption is \\nthe basic assumption of the perfectly competitive market.\\n2. Investors make their decisions only on the basis of the expected returns, standard \\ndeviations and co variances of all pairs of securities.\\n3. Investors are assumed to have homogenous expectations during the decision-making \\nperiod.\\n4. The investor can lend or borrow any amount of funds at the riskless rate of interest. \\nThe riskless rate of interest is the rate of interest offered for the treasury bills or \\nGovernment securities.\\n5. Assets are infinitely divisible. According to this assumption, investor could buy any \\nquantity of share i.e. they can even buy ten rupees worth of Reliance Industry shares.\\n6. There is no transaction cost i.e. no cost involved in buying and selling of stocks.\\n7. There is no personal income tax. Hence, the investor is indifferent to the form of \\nreturn either capital gain or dividend.\\n8. Unlimited quantum of short sales is allowed. Any amount of shares an individual can \\nsell short.\\nLending and Borrowing \\n Here, it is assumed that the investor could borrow or lend any amount money at \\nriskless rate of interest. When this opportunity is given to the investors, they can mix \\nrisk free assets with the risky assets in a portfolio to obtain a desired rate of risk-return \\ncombination.\\nRp  = Portfolio return\\nXf  = the proportion of funds invested in risk free assets'),\n",

The capital asset pricing theory explains the return of the securities on the \\nbasis of their respective betas. According to the previous models, the investor chooses the \\ninvestment on the basis of expected return and variance. The alternative model developed \\nin asset pricing by Stephen Ross is known as Arbitrage Pricing Theory. The APT theory \\nexplains the nature of equilibrium in the asset pricing in a less complicated manner with \\nfewer assumptions compared to CAPM.\\nArbitrage\\n Arbitrage is a process of earning profit by taking advantage of differential pricing for \\nthe same asset. The process generates riskless profit. In the security market, it is of selling \\nsecurity at a high price and the simultaneous purchase of the same security at a relatively \\nlower price. \\n Since the profit earned through arbitrage is riskless, the investors have the incentive \\nto undertake this whenever an opportunity arises. In general, some investors indulge \\nmore in this type of activities than others. However, the buying and selling activities of \\nthe arbitrageur reduce and eliminate the profit margin, bringing the market price to the \\nequilibrium level.\\nThe Assumptions\\n1. The investors have homogenous expectations.\\n2. The investors are risk averse and utility maximisers.\\n3. Perfect competition prevails in the market and there is no transaction cost.\\n The APT theory does not assume (1) single period investment horizon, (2) no taxes \\n(3) investors can borrow and lend at risk free rate of interest and (4) the selection of the \\nportfolio is based on the mean and variance analysis. These assumptions are present in the \\nCAPM theory.'),\n",

He also likes to keep \\nthe risk at the same level. For example, the investor holds A, B and C securities and he wants \\nto change the proportion of the securities without any additional financial commitment. \\nNow the change in proportion of securities can be denoted by X A, XB, and XC. The increase \\nin the investment in security A could be carried out only if he reduces the proportion of \\ninvestment either in B or C because it has already stated that the investor tries to earn \\nmore income without increasing his financial commitment. Thus, the changes in different \\nsecurities will add up to zero. This is the basic requirement of an arbitrage portfolio. If X \\nindicates the change in proportion,\\n ΔX A + Δ XB + ΔXC = 0\\n The factor sensitivity indicates the responsiveness of a security’s return to a \\nparticular factor. The sensitiveness of the securities to any factor is the weighted average \\nof the sensitivities of the securities, weights being the changes made in the proportion. For \\nexample b A, bB and b are the sensitivities, in an arbitrage portfolio the sensitivities become \\nzero.\\n h AΔXA +bBΔXB +bcΔXc = 0\\n The investor holds the A, B and C stocks with the following returns and sensitivity \\nto changes in the industrial production.

Chen, Roll \\nand Ross have taken four macro economic variables and tested them. According to them \\nthe factors are inflation, the term structure of interest rates, risk premium and industrial \\nproduction. Inflation affects the discount rate or the required rate of return and the size \\nof the future cash flows.

The difference between the return on the high grade bonds and low grade (more \\nrisky) bonds indicates the market’s reaction to risk. The industrial production represents \\nthe business cycle. Changes in the industrial production have an impact on the expectations \\nand opportunities of the investor. The real value of the cash flow is also affected by it.\\n Burmeister and McElroy have estimated the sensitivities with some other factors. \\nThey are given below \\n  ➢ Default risk\\n  ➢ Time premium\\n  ➢ Deflation\\n  ➢ Change in expected sales\\n  ➢ The market returns not due to the first four variables.\\n The default risk is measured by the difference between the return on long term \\ngovernment bonds and the return on long terms bonds issued by corporate plus one-half \\nof one per cent. Lime premium is measured by the return on long term government bonds \\nminus one month Treasury bill rate one month ahead. \\n Deflation is measured by expected inflation at the beginning of the month minus \\nactual inflation during the month. According to then, the first four factors accounted 25% \\nof the variation in the Standard and 1or Composite Index and all the four co-efficient were \\nsignificant.\\n Salomon Brothers identified five factors in their fundamental factor model. Inflation \\nis the only common factor identified by others. The other factors are given below\\n  ➢ Growth rate in gross national product\\n  ➢ Rate of interest\\n  ➢ Rate of change in oil prices\\n  ➢ Rate of change in defence spending\\n All the three sets of factors have some common characteristics.

When only one factor is taken into consideration, the APT can be stated as:\\n R i = λ0 + bi λi\\nIt is similar to the capital market line equation\\n R  = R f + ß (R m —Rf)\\nWhich is similar to the CAPM model?\\n APT is more general and less restrictive than CAPM. In APT, the investor has no \\nneed to bold the market portfolio because it does not make use of the market portfolio \\nconcept. The portfolios are constructed on the basis of the factors to eliminate arbitrage \\nprofits. APT is based on the law of one price to hold for all possible portfolio combinations.\\n The APT model takes into account of the impact of numerous factors on the security. \\nThe macro economic factors are taken into consideration and it is closer to reality than \\nCAPM.\\n The market portfolio is well defined conceptually. In APT model, factors are not well \\nspecified. Hence the investor finds it difficult to establish equilibrium relationship. The well \\ndefined market portfolio is a significant advantage of the CAPM leading to the wide usage \\nof the model in the stock market.\\n The factors that have impact on one group of securities may not affect another group \\nof securities. There is a lack of consistency in the measurements of the APT model.\\n Further, the influences of the factors are not independent of each other.

The evaluation of the portfolio provides a feed back about the \\nperformance to evolve better management strategy. Even though evaluation of portfolio \\nperformance is considered to be the last stage of investment process, it is a continuous \\nprocess. The managed portfolios are commonly known as mutual funds. Various managed \\nportfolios are prevalent in the capital market. Their relative merits of return and risk criteria \\nhave to be evaluated.\\nMutual Fund\\n Mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools together funds from investors to \\npurchase stocks, bonds or other securities. An investor can participate in the mutual fund \\nby buying the units of the fund. Each unit is backed by a diversified pool of assets, where the \\nfunds have been invested. A closed-end fund has a fixed number of units outstanding. It is \\nopen for a specific period. During that period investors can buy it. The initial offer period \\nis terminated at the end of the pre-determined period. The closed-end schemes are listed \\nin the stock exchanges. The investor can trade the units in the stock markets just like other \\nsecurities. The prices may be either quoted at a premium or discount.\\n In the open-end schemes, units are sold and bought continuously. The investors can \\ndirectly approach the fund managers to buy or sell the units. The price of the unit is based \\non the net asset value of the particular scheme. The net asset value of the fund is the value \\nof the underlying securities of the scheme. The net asset value is calculated on a daily or \\nweekly basis. \\n The gain or loss made by the mutual fund is passed on to the investors after deducting \\nthe administrative expenses and investment management fees, The gains are distributed to \\nthe unit holder in the form of dividend or reinvested by the fund to generate further gains.\\n The mutual fund may be with or without a load factor. A commission or charge paid \\nby the investors while purchasing or selling the mutual fund is known as load factor. Front-\\nend load is charged when units are sold by the funds and back-end load is charged when \\nthe units are repurchased by the funds. The front-end load factor reduces the units when '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='253\\nthe investor buys it and the back-end load reduces the investor’s proceeds when he sells \\nthe units. Generally, the load factor ranges between 1 and 6 per cent of the net asset value. \\nSometimes, the fund may not charge both the loads.\\nAdvantages of Mutual Funds\\n The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), a non- profit organization serving \\nthe cause of mutual funds, has listed the following advantages to the investors in mutual \\nfunds.\\n1. Professional Management \\n Experienced fund managers supported by a research team, select appropriate \\nsecurities to the fund. The forecasting of the market is done effectively.\\n2. Diversification \\n Mutual funds invest in a diverse range of securities and over many industries. Hence, \\nall the eggs are not placed in one basket. Normally an investor has to have large sum of \\nmoney to achieve this objective, if he invests directly in the stock market. Through mutual \\nfunds, he can achieve diversification of portfolio at a fraction of the cost.\\n3. Convenient Administration \\n For the investors there is reduction in paper work and saving in time. It is also \\nvery convenient. Mutual funds help in overcoming the problems relating to bad deliveries, \\ndelayed payments and the like.\\n4. Return Potential \\n Medium and the long term mutual funds have the potential to provide high returns.\\n5. Low Costs \\n The funds handle the investments of a large number of people, they are in a position \\nto pass on relatively low brokerage and other costs. This is because the funds can take \\nadvantage of the economies of scale.'),\n",

In open-end schemes, the investor can get back \\nhis money at any time by selling back the units to the fund at NAV related prices. In closed-\\nend fund, he has the option to sell the units through the stock exchange.\\n7. Transparency \\n Mutual funds provide information on each scheme about the specific investments \\nmade there under and so on.\\n8. Flexibility \\n Currently most funds have regular investment plans, regular withdrawal plans and \\ndividend reinvestment schemes. A great deal of flexibility is assured in the process.\\n9.

Fluctuations that occur in the equity prices cause substantial \\ngain or loss to the investors. The investor should have competence and skill in the revision \\nof the portfolio. Normally the average investor dislikes to sell in the bull market with the \\nanticipation of further rise. Likewise, he is reluctant to buy in the bear market with the \\nanticipation of further fall.\\nThe portfolio management process needs frequent changes in the composition of \\nstocks and bonds. In securities, the type of securities to be held should be revised according \\nto the portfolio policy. If the policy of investor shifts from earnings to capital appreciation, \\nthe stocks should be revised accordingly. An investor can sell his shares if the price of \\nshares reaches the historic high prices. Likewise, if the security does not fulfill the investor’s \\nexpectation regarding return and growth, it is better to get rid of it. The investor should also \\nconsider the factors like risk, quality and tax concessions. If another stock offers a competitive \\nedge over the present stock, investment should be shifted to the other stock. Many investors \\nfind themselves inadequate in their ability to trade and earn profit. Mechanical methods are \\nadopted to earn better profit through proper timing. Such types of mechanical methods are \\nFormula Plans and Swaps.\\nPassive Management\\nPassive management is a process of holding a well diversified portfolio for a long \\nterm with the buy and hold approach. Passive management refers to the investor’s attempt \\nto construct a portfolio that resembles the overall market returns. The simplest form of \\npassive management is holding the Index fund that is designed to replicate a good and well \\ndefined index of the common stock such as BSE-Sensex or NSE-Nifty. The fund manager \\nbuys every stock in the index in exact proportion of the stock in that index. If Reliance \\nIndustry’s stock constitutes 5% of the index, the fund also invests 5% of its money in Reliance \\nIndustry stock.\\nThe problem in the index fund is the transaction cost. If it is NSE-Nifty, the manager \\nhas to buy all the 50 stocks in market proportion and cannot leave the stocks with smallest \\nweights to save the transaction costs. Further, the reinvestment of the dividends also poses '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 267}, page_content='264\\na problem. Here, the alternative is to keep the cash in hand or to invest the money in stocks \\nincurring transaction cost. Keeping away the stock of smallest weights and the money in \\nhand fail to replicate the index fund in the proper manner. The commonly used approaches \\nin constructing an index fund are as follows:\\n1. Keeping each stock in proportion to its representation in the index\\n2. Holding a specified number of stocks for example 20, which historically track the \\nindex in the best manner.\\n3. Holding a smaller set of stocks to match the index in a pre-specified set of \\ncharacteristics. This may be in terms of sector, industry and the market capitalisation.\\nActive Management\\nActive Management is holding securities based on the forecast about the future. \\nThe portfolio managers who pursue active strategy with respect to market components are \\ncalled ‘market timers’ . The portfolio managers vary their cash position or beta of the equity \\nportion of the portfolio based on the market forecast. The managers may indulge in ‘group \\nrotation’s. Here, the group rotation means changing the investment in different industries’ \\nstocks depending on the assessed expectations regarding their future performance.\\nStocks that seem to be best bets or attractive are given more weights in the portfolio \\nthan their weights in the index. For example, Information Technology or Fast Moving \\nConsumer Goods industry stocks may be given more weights than their respective weights \\nin the NSE-50. At the same time, stocks that are considered to be less attractive are given \\nlower weights compared to their weights in the index. \\nHere, the portfolio manager may either remain passive with respect to market and \\ngroup components but active in the stock selection process or he may be active in the \\nmarket, group and stock selection process.\\nThe Formula Plans\\nThe formula plans provide the basic rules and regulations for the purchase and sale \\nof securities. The amount to be spent on the different types of securities is fixed. The amount \\nmay be fixed either in constant or variable ratio. This depends on the investor’s attitude \\ntowards risk and return. The commonly used formula plans are rupee cost averaging, \\nconstant rupee value, the constant ratio and the variable ratio plans. The formula plans help \\nto divide the investible fund between the aggressive and conservative portfolios.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\1InvestmentandPortfolioManagement.pdf', 'page': 268}, page_content='265\\nThe aggressive portfolio consists more of common stocks which yield high return \\nwith high risk. The aggressive portfolio’s return is volatile because the share prices generally \\nfluctuate. The conservative portfolio consists of more bonds that have fixed rate of returns. \\nIt is called conservative portfolio because the return is certain and the risk is less. The \\nconservative portfolio serves as a cushion for the volatility of the aggressive portfolio. The \\ncapital appreciation in the conservative portfolio is rather slow and the fall in price of the \\nbond or debenture is also alike.\\nAssumptions of the Formula Plan\\n1. The first assumption is that certain percentage of the investor’s fund is allocated to \\nfixed income securities and common stocks. The proportion of money invested in \\neach component depends on the prevailing market condition. If the stock market is \\nin the boom condition lesser funds are allotted to stocks. Perhaps it may be a ratio of \\n80 per cent to bonds and 20 per cent to stocks in the portfolio. If the market is low, \\nthe proportion may reverse. In a balanced fund, 50 per cent of the fund is invested in \\nstocks and 50 per cent in bonds.\\n2. The second assumption is that if the market moves higher, the proportion of stocks in \\nthe portfolio may either decline or remain constant. The portfolio is more aggressive \\nin the low market and defensive when the market is on the rise.\\n3. The third assumption is that the stocks are bought and sold whenever there is a \\nsignificant change in the price. The changes in the level of market could be measured \\nwith the help of indices like BSE-Sensitive Index and NSE-Nifty.\\n4. The fourth assumption requires that the investor should strictly follow the formula \\nplan once lie chooses it. He should not abandon the plan but continue to act on the \\nplan.\\n5. The investors should select good stocks that move along with the market. They \\nshould reflect the risk and return features of the market. The stock price movement \\nshould be closely correlated with the market movement and the beta value should be \\naround 1.0. The stocks of the fundamentally strong companies have to be included \\nin the portfolio.\\nAdvantages of the Formula Plan\\n  ➢ Basic rules and regulations for the purchase and sale of securities are provided. \\n  ➢ The rules and regulations are rigid and help to overcome human emotion. \\n  ➢ The investor can earn higher profits by adopting the plans.'),\n",

The selection of the \\nsecurity has to be done either on the basis of the fundamental or technical analysis.\\n  ➢ It is strict and not flexible with the inherent problem of adjustment.\\n  ➢ The formula plan should be applied for long periods, otherwise the transaction cost \\nmay be high.\\n  ➢ Even if the investor adopts the formula plan, he needs forecasting. Market forecasting \\nhelps him to identify the best stocks.\\nRupee Cost Averaging\\nThe simplest and most effective formula plan is rupee cost averaging. First, stocks \\nwith good fundamentals and long term growth prospects should be selected. Such stocks’ \\nprices tend to be volatile in the market and provide maximum benefit from rupee cost \\naveraging. Secondly, the investor should make a regular commitment of buying shares at \\nregular intervals. Once he makes a commitment, he should purchase the shares regardless of \\nthe stock’s price, the company’s short term performance and the economic factors affecting \\nthe stock market.\\nIn the rupee cost averaging plan, the investor buys varying number of shares at \\nvarious points of the stock market cycle. In a way, it can be called time diversification. Let us \\nassume that an investor decides to buy Rs11000 worth of particular shares for four quarters \\nin one particular year, ignoring the transaction costs.

The constant rupee plan starts with a fixed amount of money invested in selected \\nstocks and bonds. When the price of the stocks increases, the investor sells sufficient amount \\nof stocks to return to the original amount of the investment in stocks. By keeping the value \\nof aggressive portfolio constant, remainder is invested in the conservative portfolio.\\nThe investor must choose action points or revaluation points. The action points \\nare the times at which the investor has to readjust the values of the stocks in the portfolio. \\nStocks’ values cannot be continuously the same and the investor has to be watchful of the \\nmarket price movements. Stocks’ value in the portfolio can be allowed to fluctuate to a \\ncertain extent. Percentage change in price like 5%, 10% or 20% can be fixed by the investor. \\nAllowing only small percentage change would result in a lot of transaction cost and would \\nnot be beneficial to the investor. If the action points are too large, the investor may not be \\nable get full benefit out of the price fluctuations.

He makes quarterly adjustment if the \\nstock portion falls or rises by 20%. In the third quarter, the stock prices fell by 20% initiating \\nthe action. He shifted ` 2000 from the bonds’ portion and bought 50 shares. This lifted the \\nvalue of stock portion again to ` 10,000.'),\n",

In this action point the investor disposes off the shares and shifts the money to \\nthe bond portion. By this the stock amount in the portfolio has remained constant but the \\ntotal portfolio value has increased. The investor stands to gain by the total portfolio value \\nappreciation.\\nThe major advantage of this plan is that purchase and sales are determined \\nautomatically. This facilitates the investor to earn capital gain by selling the stocks when the \\nprice increases and buying it at a relatively lower price. To make the plan operate effectively, \\nat the starting point, stocks should not be purchased either at high prices or at too low \\nprices. If the investor starts the purchase at the extreme price level, the stock fund\\nmay be either too small or too large.\\nConstant Ratio Plan\\nConstant ratio plan attempts to maintain a constant ratio between the aggressive and \\nconservative portfolios. The ratio is fixed by the investor. The investor’s attitude towards \\nrisk and return plays a major role in fixing the ratio. The conservative investor may like to \\nhave more of bond and the aggressive investor, more of stocks. Once the r$io is fixed, it is \\nmaintained as the market moves up and down. As usual, action points may be fixed by the \\ninvestor. It may vary from investor to investor. As in the previous example, when the stock \\nprice moves up or down by 10 to 20 per cent action would be taken. Here, 10 per cent is \\ntaken as action point.

But this approach does not eliminate the \\nnecessity of selecting individual security.\\nThe limitation of the plan is that the money is shifted from the stock portion to bond \\nportion. Bond is also a capital market instrument and responds to market pressures. Bond \\nand share prices may both rise and fall at the same time. In the downtrend both prices may \\ndecline and then gain.\\nVariable Ratio Plan\\nAccording to this plan, at varying levels of market price, the proportions of the \\nstocks and bonds change. Whenever the price of the stock increases, the stocks are sold and \\nnew ratio is adopted by increasing the proportion of defensive or conservative portfolio. \\nTo adopt this plan, the investor is required to estimate a long term trend in the price of the \\nstocks. Forecasting is very essential to this plan. When there is a wide fluctuation variable \\nratio plan is useful. The table explains the variable ratio plan.\\nVariable Ratio Plan\\nShare \\nprice \\n(`)\\nValue of Stock \\nportion ( `)\\nValue of \\nDefensive \\n(`)\\nTotal \\nPortfolio \\nvalue ( `)\\nStock as a \\nPercentage of \\nPortfolio ( `)\\nPortfolio \\nAdjustment\\nShares in \\nStock Portion \\n(`)\\n100 10,000 10,000 20,000 50.00 - 100\\n90 9,000 10,000 19,000 47.37 - 100\\n80 8,000 10,000 18,000 44.4 - 100\\n80 12,640 5,400 18,040 70.06 Bought 58 \\nshares 158\\n90 14,220 5,400 19,620 72.48 - 158\\n100 15,800 5,400 21,200 74.53 Sold 50 \\nshares 158\\n100 10,800 10,800 21,600 50.00 - 108\\nIn the above example, the portfolio is adjusted for every 20 per cent change in the \\nstock price. This adjustment criterion may be different for different investors depending \\nupon their attitude towards risk and return. The portfolio is divided into two equal portions \\nas in the case of other plans, with R,10,000 in each.

As the market \\nprice for the stock reaches a 20 per cent decline, that is to Rs,80, the adjustment action takes '),\n",

Once again, \\nwhen there is a 20 per cent change, the adjustment action is triggered. When the prices \\nhave increased to ` 100, the investor sells 50 shares and the stock portion in the portfolio is \\nreduced back to 50 per cent.\\nThe figure explains the variable ratio plan.\\nThe middle line is the trend line that represents the investor’s expectation about of \\nfuture course of prices. Zone 1 and 3 represent respectively of 10 and 20 per cent deviations \\nabove the expected trend, and zones 2 and 4 represent respectively 10 and 20 per cent \\ndeviations below the expected trend. Starting at ` 50, the portfolio’s bonds and stocks ratio \\nis 50:50. \\nAt point A, the portfolio is adjusted to the next proportion, in this case 60 per cent \\nbonds and 40 per cent stocks. At B, again it is 50:50. Below point C there would be more \\nstocks than bonds. Because of the decline in stock price, more stocks are purchased. Above \\nthe point D, it is again 50:50. The line moves closer to the trend line\\nAdvantages  \\nAutomatically, the investor tends to correct his portfolio portions according to the \\nprice changes. The investor is not emotionally affected by the price changes in the market. \\nWith accurate forecast the variable ratio plan takes greater advantage of price fluctuations \\nthan the constant ratio plan.'),\n",

The investor has to construct the appropriate zones and trend for alterations of the \\nproportions\\n2. The selection of security has to be done by the investor by analysing the merits of the \\nstock. The plan does not help in the selection of scrips.\\n3. If the zones are too small frequent changes have to be done and it would limit \\nportfolio performance. \\nRevision and the Cost\\nWith the passage of time the stocks which were attractive once may turn out to be \\nless attractive in terms of return. The investor’s attitude towards risk and return also may \\nchange and the forecast regarding the market also may undergo change. In this context, the \\nnecessary revision is thought of by the portfolio manager. In revision of traded volumes the \\nportfolio manager has to incur brokerage commission, price impact and bid-ask spread. \\nPrice impact means the effects on the price of stock. In simple terms, if the size of the trade \\nis heavy on the buying side, the prices of the stock may increase. The bid-ask spread is the \\ndifference between the price that the market maker is willing to buy and sell the stock. \\nThese costs may be higher in small size stocks and the benefits of revision may be nullified \\nby it. Usually revision is done with the view of either increasing the expected return of the \\nportfolio or to reduce the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio.\\nSW APS\\nSwap is a contract between two parties to exchange a set of cash flows over a pre-\\ndetermined period of time. The two parties are known as counter parties. In an equity \\nswap one counter party, say ‘ A ’ , agrees to pay cash based on the rate of return of an agreed \\nstock market index to the second counter party ‘B’ . Since the payments are based on the \\nmarket index, they vary according to index movements. The second counter party B agrees \\nto pay the fixed amount of cash payments based on the current interest rate to the first \\ncounterparty A. Thus, the payment depends upon the underlying security. This agreement \\nmeans that A has sold stocks and bought bonds while B has sold bonds and bought stocks. \\nHere, they have restricted their portfolios without the transaction costs, even though they \\nhave to pay the swap fee to the swap bank that set up the contract between the two parties.\\nThis can be explained with the help of an example.

Many of the more practical aspects of personal finance \\nwill change over time, as practices, technologies, intermediaries, customs, and laws \\nchange, but a fundamental awareness of ways to think well about solving financial \\nquestions can always be useful. Some of the more practical ideas may be obviously and \\nimmediately relevant— and some not— but decision-making and research skills are \\nlasting. \\nYou may be enrolled in a traditional two- or four-year degree program or may just be \\ntaking the course for personal growth. You may be of any age and may have already \\ndone more or less academic and experiential learning. You may be a business major, \\nwith some prerequisite knowledge of economics or level of accounting or math skills, or \\nyou may be filling in an elective and have no such skills. In fact, although they enhance \\npersonal finance decisions, such skills are not necessary. Software, downloadable \\napplications, and calculators perform ever more sophisticated functions with ever more \\napproachable interfaces. The emphasis in this text is on understanding the fundamental \\nrelationships behind the math and being able to use that understanding to make better \\ndecisions about your personal finances. \\nEntire tomes, both academic texts and trade books, have been and will be written about \\nany of the subjects featured in each chapter of this text. The idea here is to introduce you \\nto the practical and conceptual framework for making personal financial decisions in the \\nlarger context of your life, and in the even larger context of your individual life as part of \\na greater economy of financial participants. \\nStructure \\nThe text may be divided into five sections: \\n1. Learning Basic Skills, Knowledge, and Context (Chapter 1 \"Personal Financial \\nPlanning\"–Chapter 6 \"Taxes and Tax Planning\") \\n2. Getting What You Want (Chapter 7 \"Financial Management\"–Chapter 9 \"Buying \\na Home\") \\n3. Protecting What You’ve Got (Chapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: \\nInsurance\"–Chapter 11 \"Personal Risk Management: Retirement and Estate \\nPlanning\") \\n4. Building Wealth (Chapter 12 \"Investing\"–Chapter 17 \"Investing in Mutual Funds, \\nCommodities, Real Estate, and Collectibles\") \\n5. How to Get Started (Chapter 18 \"Career Planning\") '),\n",

Most of us start with nothing to trade but \\nlabor. We hope to sustain our desired lifestyle on the earnings from labor and to \\ngradually (or quickly) amass capital that will then provide additional earnings. \\n  \\nLearning Basic Skills, Knowledge, and Context (Chapter 1 \"Personal \\nFinancial Planning\"–Chapter 6 \"Taxes and Tax Planning\") \\nChapter 1 \"Personal Financial Planning\" introduces four of its major themes: \\n• Financial decisions are individual-specific (Section 1.1 \"Individual or “Micro” \\nFactors That Affect Financial Thinking\"). \\n• Financial decisions are economic decisions (Section 1.2 \"Systemic or “Macro” \\nFactors That Affect Financial Thinking\"). \\n• Financial decision making is a continuous process (Section 1.3 \"The Planning \\nProcess\"). \\n• Professional advisors work for financial decision makers (Section 1.4 \"Financial \\nPlanning Professionals\"). \\nThese themes emphasize the idiosyncratic, systemic, and continuous nature of personal \\nfinance, putting decisions within the larger contexts of an entire lifetime and an \\neconomy. \\nChapter 2 \"Basic Ideas of Finance\" introduces the basic financial and accounting \\ncategories of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and net worth as tools to understand \\nthe relationships between them as a way, in turn, of organizing financial thinking. It also \\nintroduces the concepts of opportunity costs and sunk costs as implicit but critical \\nconsiderations in financial thinking. \\nChapter 3 \"Financial Statements\" continues with the discussion of organizing financial \\ndata to help in decision making and introduces basic analytical tools that can be used to \\nclarify the situation portrayed in financial statements. \\nChapter 4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\" introduces the critical \\nrelationships of time and risk to value. It demonstrates the math but focuses on the role \\nthat those relationships play in financial thinking, especially in comparing and \\nevaluating choices in making financial decisions. \\nChapter 5 \"Financial Plans: Budgets\" demonstrates how organized financial data can be \\nused to create a plan, monitor progress, and adjust goals. \\nChapter 6 \"Taxes and Tax Planning\" discusses the role of taxation in personal finance \\nand its effects on earnings and on accumulating wealth. The chapter emphasizes the '),\n",

The chapter discusses its role both \\nas a living expense and an investment, as well as the financing and financial \\nconsequences of the purchase. \\n  \\nProtecting What You’ve Got (Chapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: \\nInsurance\"–Chapter 11 \"Personal Risk Management: Retirement and Estate \\nPlanning\") \\nChapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: Insurance\" introduces the idea of \\nincorporating risk management into financial planning. An awareness of the need for \\nrisk management often comes with age and experience. This chapter focuses on \\nplanning for the unexpected. It progresses from the more obvious risks to property to \\nthe less obvious risks, such as the possible inability to earn due to temporary ill health, \\npermanent disability, or death. \\nChapter 11 \"Personal Risk Management: Retirement and Estate Planning\" focuses on \\nplanning for the expected: retirement, loss of income from wages, and the subsequent \\ndistribution of assets after death. Retirement planning discusses ways to develop \\nalternative sources of income from capital that can eventually substitute for wages. \\nEstate planning also touches on the considerations and mechanics of distributing \\naccumulated wealth. \\n  \\nBuilding Wealth (Chapter 12 \"Investing\"–Chapter 17 \"Investing in Mutual \\nFunds, Commodities, Real Estate, and Collectibles\") '),\n",

Bryon is \\ngetting a degree in protective services and is thinking of going for certification as a fire \\nprotection engineer, which would cost an additional $4,500. With his protective services \\ndegree many other fields will be open to him as well— from first responder to game \\nwarden or correctional officer. Bryon will have to specialize immediately and wants a job \\nin his state that comes with some occupational safety and a lot of job security. \\nTomika is getting a Bachelor of Science degree in medical technology and hopes to \\nparlay that into a job as a lab technician. She has interviews lined up at a nearby \\nregional hospital and a local pharmaceutical firm. She hopes she gets the hospital job \\nbecause it pays a little better and offers additional training on site. Both Bryon and \\nTomika will need additional training to have the jobs they want, and they are already in \\ndebt for their educations. \\nTomika qualified for a Stafford loan, and the federal government subsidizes her loan by \\npaying the interest on it until six months after she graduates. She will owe about \\n$40,000 of principal plus interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.8 percent. Tomika plans to \\nstart working immediately on graduation and to take classes on the job or at night for as \\nlong as it takes to get the extra certification she needs. Unsubsidized, the extra training \\nwould cost about $3,500. She presently earns about $5,000 a year working weekends as \\na home health aide and could easily double that after she graduates. Tomika also \\nqualified for a Pell grant of around $5,000 each year she was a full-time student, which \\nhas paid for her rooms in an off-campus student co-op housing unit. Bryon also lives \\nthere, and that’s how they met. \\nBryon would like to get to a point in his life where he can propose marriage to Tomika \\nand looks forward to being a family man one day. He was awarded a service scholarship \\nfrom his hometown and received windfall money from his grandmother’s estate after \\nshe died in his sophomore year. He also borrowed $30,000 for five years at only 2.25 \\npercent interest from his local bank through a family circle savings plan. He has been \\nattending classes part-time year-round so he can work to earn money for college and \\nliving expenses. He earns about $19,000 a year working for catering services. Bryon \\nfeels very strongly about repaying his relatives who have helped finance his education \\nand also is willing to help Tomika pay off her Stafford loan after they marry. \\nTomika has $3,000 in U.S. Treasury Series EE savings bonds, which mature in two \\nyears, and has managed to put aside $600 in a savings account earmarked for clothes \\nand gifts. Bryon has sunk all his savings into tuition and books, and his only other asset '),\n",

For \\nboth Tomika and Bryon, having reliable transportation to their jobs is a concern. \\nTomika hopes to continue using public transportation to get to a new job after \\ngraduation. Both Bryon and Tomika are smart enough about money to have avoided \\ngetting into credit card debt. Each keeps only one major credit card and a debit card and \\nwith rare exceptions pays statements in full each month. \\nBryon and Tomika will have to find new housing after they graduate. They could look for \\nanother cooperative housing opportunity or rent apartments, or they could get married \\nnow instead of waiting. Bryon also has a rent-free option of moving in temporarily with \\nhis brother. Tomika feels very strongly about saving money to buy a home and wants to \\nwait until her career is well established before having a child. Tomika is concerned about \\ngetting good job benefits, especially medical insurance and family leave. Although still \\nyoung, Bryon is concerned about being able to retire, the sooner the better, but he has \\nno idea how that would be possible. He thinks he would enjoy running his own catering \\nfirm as a retirement business some day. \\nTomika’s starting salary as a lab technician will be about $30,000, and as a fire \\nprotection engineer, Bryon would have a starting salary of about $38,000. Both have the \\npotential to double their salaries after fifteen years on the job, but they are worried \\nabout the economy. Their graduations are coinciding with a downturn. Aside from \\nTomika’s savings bonds, she and Bryon are not in the investment market, although as \\nsoon as he can Bryon wants to invest in a diversified portfolio of money market funds \\nthat include corporate stocks and municipal bonds. Nevertheless, the state of the \\neconomy affects their situation. Money is tight and loans are hard to get, jobs are scarce \\nand highly competitive, purchasing power and interest rates are rising, and pension \\nplans and retirement funds are at risk of losing value. It’s uncertain how long it will be \\nbefore the trend reverses, so for the short term, they need to play it safe.

How will larger economic factors affect the decisions Bryon and Tomika make \\nand the outcomes of those decisions? \\nYou will make financial decisions all your life. Sometimes you can see those decisions \\ncoming and plan deliberately; sometimes, well, stuff happens, and you are faced with a \\nmore sudden decision. Personal financial planning is about making deliberate decisions \\nthat allow you to get closer to your goals or sudden decisions that allow you to stay on \\ntrack, even when things take an unexpected turn. \\nThe idea of personal financial planning is really no different from the idea of planning \\nmost anything: you figure out where you’d like to be, where you are, and how to go from \\nhere to there. The process is complicated by the number of factors to consider, by their \\ncomplex relationships to each other, and by the profound nature of these decisions, \\nbecause how you finance your life will, to a large extent, determine the life that you live. \\nThe process is also, often enormously, complicated by risk: you are often making \\ndecisions with plenty of information, but little certainty or even predictability. \\nPersonal financial planning is a lifelong process. Your time horizon is as long as can be—\\nuntil the very end of your life— and during that time your circumstances will change in \\npredictable and unpredictable ways. A financial plan has to be re-evaluated, adjusted, \\nand re-adjusted. It has to be flexible enough to be responsive to unanticipated needs and \\ndesires, robust enough to advance toward goals, and all the while be able to protect from \\nunimagined risks. \\nOne of the most critical resources in the planning process is information. We live in a \\nworld awash in information— and no shortage of advice— but to use that information \\nwell you have to understand what it is telling you, why it matters, where it comes from, \\nand how to use it in the planning process. You need to be able to put that information in \\ncontext, before you can use it wisely. That context includes factors in your individual \\nsituation that affect your financial thinking, and factors in the wider economy that affect \\nyour financial decision making. \\n '),\n",

List individual factors that strongly influence financial thinking. \\n2. Discuss how income, income needs, risk tolerance, and wealth are affected by individual factors.  \\n3. Explain how life stages affect financial decision making. \\n4. Summarize the basis of sound financial planning. \\nThe circumstances or characteristics of your life influence your financial concerns and \\nplans. What you want and need— and how and to what extent you want to protect the \\nsatisfaction of your wants and needs— all depend on how you live and how you’d like to \\nlive in the future. While everyone is different, there are common circumstances of life \\nthat affect personal financial concerns and thus affect everyone’s financial planning. \\nFactors that affect personal financial concerns are family structure, health, career \\nchoices, and age. \\nFamily Structure \\nMarital status and dependents, such as children, parents, or siblings, determine whether \\nyou are planning only for yourself or for others as well. If you have a spouse or \\ndependents, you have a financial responsibility to someone else, and that includes a \\nresponsibility to include them in your financial thinking. You may expect the \\ndependence of a family member to end at some point, as with children or elderly \\nparents, or you may have lifelong responsibilities to and for another person. \\nPartners and dependents affect your financial planning as you seek to provide for them, \\nsuch as paying for children’s education. Parents typically want to protect or improve the \\nquality of life for their children and may choose to limit their own fulfillment to achieve \\nthat end. \\nProviding for others increases income needs. Being responsible for others also affects \\nyour attitudes toward and tolerance of risk. Typically, both the willingness and ability to \\nassume risk diminishes with dependents, and a desire for more financial protection \\ngrows. People often seek protection for their income or assets even past their own \\nlifetimes to ensure the continued well-being of partners and dependents. An example is \\na life insurance policy naming a spouse or dependents as beneficiaries. \\nHealth '),\n",

Personal financial \\nplanning should include some protection against the risk of chronic illness, accident, or \\nlong-term disability and some provision for short-term events, such as pregnancy and \\nbirth. If your health limits your earnings or ability to work or adds significantly to your \\nexpenditures, your income needs may increase. The need to protect yourself against \\nfurther limitations or increased costs may also increase. At the same time your tolerance \\nfor risk may decrease, further affecting your financial decisions. \\nCareer Choice \\nYour career choices affect your financial planning, especially through educational \\nrequirements, income potential, and characteristics of the occupation or profession you \\nchoose. Careers have different hours, pay, benefits, risk factors, and patterns of \\nadvancement over time. Thus, your financial planning will reflect the realities of being a \\npostal worker, professional athlete, commissioned sales representative, corporate \\nlawyer, freelance photographer, librarian, building contractor, tax preparer, professor, \\nWeb site designer, and so on. For example, the careers of most athletes end before \\nmiddle age, have higher risk of injury, and command steady, higher-than-average \\nincomes, while the careers of most sales representatives last longer with greater risk of \\nunpredictable income fluctuations.

Over time they may choose to change careers, develop additional \\nsources of concurrent income, move between employment and self-employment, or \\nbecome unemployed or reemployed. Along with career choices, all these changes affect \\npersonal financial management and planning. \\nAge \\nNeeds, desires, values, and priorities all change over a lifetime, and financial concerns \\nchange accordingly. Ideally, personal finance is a process of management and planning \\nthat anticipates or keeps abreast with changes. Although everyone is different, some \\nfinancial concerns are common to or typical of the different stages of adult life. Analysis \\nof life stages is part of financial planning. \\nAt the beginning of your adult life, you are more likely to have no dependents, little if \\nany accumulated wealth, and few assets. (Assets are resources that can be used to \\ncreate income, decrease expenses, or store wealth as an investment.) As a young adult \\nyou also are likely to have comparatively small income needs, especially if you are \\nproviding only for yourself. Your employment income is probably your primary or sole \\nsource of income. Having no one and almost nothing to protect, your willingness to \\nassume risk is usually high. At this point in your life, you are focused on developing your \\ncareer and increasing your earned income. Any investments you may have are geared \\ntoward growth. \\nAs your career progresses, income increases but so does spending. Lifestyle expectations \\nincrease. If you now have a spouse and dependents and elderly parents to look after, you \\nhave additional needs to manage. In middle adulthood you may also be acquiring more \\nassets, such as a house, a retirement account, or an inheritance. \\nAs income, spending, and asset base grow, ability to assume risk grows, but willingness \\nto do so typically decreases. Now you have things that need protection: dependents and \\nassets. As you age, you realize that you require more protection. You may want to stop \\nworking one day, or you may suffer a decline in health. As an older adult you may want \\nto create alternative sources of income, perhaps a retirement fund, as insurance against \\na loss of employment or income.

Spending needs increase, \\nbut so do investments and alternative sources of income. \\nLater adulthood is a period of spending down. There is less reliance on earned income \\nand more on the accumulated wealth of assets and investments. You are likely to be \\nwithout dependents, as your children have grown up or your parents passed on, and so \\nwithout the responsibility of providing for them, your expenses are lower. You are likely \\nto have more leisure time, especially after retirement. \\nWithout dependents, spending needs decrease. On the other hand, you may feel free to \\nfinally indulge in those things that you’ve “always wanted.” There are no longer \\ndependents to protect, but assets demand even more protection as, without \\nemployment, they are your only source of income. Typically, your ability to assume risk \\nis high because of your accumulated assets, but your willingness to assume risk is low, \\nas you are now dependent on those assets for income. As a result, risk tolerance \\ndecreases: you are less concerned with increasing wealth than you are with protecting it. \\nEffective financial planning depends largely on an awareness of how your current and \\nfuture stages in life may influence your financial decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Personal circumstances that influence financial thinking include family structure, health, career \\nchoice, and age. \\n• Family structure and health affect income needs and risk tolerance.  \\n• Career choice affects income and wealth or asset accumulation. \\n'),\n",

Identify the systemic or macro factors that affect personal financial planning.  \\n2. Describe the impact of inflation or deflation on disposable income. \\n3. Describe the effect of rising unemployment on disposable income. \\n4. Explain how economic indicators can have an impact on personal finances.  \\nFinancial planning has to take into account conditions in the wider economy and in the \\nmarkets that make up the economy. The labor market, for example, is where labor is \\ntraded through hiring or employment. Workers compete for jobs and employers \\ncompete for workers. In the capital market, capital (cash or assets) is traded, most \\ncommonly in the form of stocks and bonds (along with other ways to package capital). \\nIn the credit market, a part of the capital market, capital is loaned and borrowed \\nrather than bought and sold. These and other markets exist in a dynamic economic \\nenvironment, and those environmental realities are part of sound financial planning. \\nIn the long term, history has proven that an economy can grow over time, that \\ninvestments can earn returns, and that the value of currency can remain relatively \\nstable. In the short term, however, that is not continuously true. Contrary or unsettled \\nperiods can upset financial plans, especially if they last long enough or happen at just \\nthe wrong time in your life. Understanding large-scale economic patterns and factors \\nthat indicate the health of an economy can help you make better financial decisions. \\nThese systemic factors include, for example, business cycles and employment rates. \\nBusiness Cycles \\nAn economy tends to be productive enough to provide for the wants of its members. \\nNormally, economic output increases as population increases or as people’s expectations \\ngrow. An economy’s output or productivity is measured by its \\ngross domestic product or GDP, the value of what is produced in a period. When the \\nGDP is increasing, the economy is in an expansion, and when it is decreasing, the \\neconomy is in a contraction. An economy that contracts for half a year is said to be in \\nrecession; a prolonged recession is a depression. The GDP is a closely watched \\nbarometer of the economy (see Figure 1.4 \"GDP Percent Change (Based on Current \\nDollars)\"). \\n \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  15 \\nFigure 1.4 GDP Percent Change (Based on Current Dollars)[1]  \\n \\nOver time, the economy tends to be cyclical, usually expanding but sometimes \\ncontracting. This is called the business cycle. Periods of contraction are generally seen \\nas market corrections, or the market regaining its equilibrium, after periods of growth. \\nGrowth is never perfectly smooth, so sometimes certain markets become unbalanced \\nand need to correct themselves. Over time, the periods of contraction seem to have \\nbecome less frequent, as you can see in Figure 1.4 \"GDP Percent Change (Based on \\nCurrent Dollars)\". The business cycles still occur nevertheless. \\nThere are many metaphors to describe the cyclical nature of market economies: “peaks \\nand troughs,” “boom and bust,” “growth and contraction,” “expansion and correction,” \\nand so on. While each cycle is born in a unique combination of circumstances, cycles \\noccur because things change and upset economic equilibrium. That is, events change the \\nbalance between supply and demand in the economy overall. Sometimes demand grows \\ntoo fast and supply can’t keep up, and sometimes supply grows too fast for demand. \\nThere are many reasons that this could happen, but whatever the reasons, buyers and \\nsellers react to this imbalance, which then creates a change. \\nEmployment Rate \\nAn economy produces not just goods and services to satisfy its members but also jobs, \\nbecause most people participate in the market economy by trading their labor, and most \\nrely on wages as their primary source of income. The economy therefore must provide \\nopportunity to earn wages so more people can participate in the economy through the \\nmarket. Otherwise, more people must be provided for in some other way, such as a \\nprivate or public subsidy (charity or welfare). \\nThe unemployment rate is a measure of an economy’s shortcomings, because it \\nshows the proportion of people who want to work but don’t because the economy cannot \\nprovide them jobs. There is always some so-called natural rate of unemployment as \\npeople move in and out of the workforce as the circumstances of their lives change— for \\nexample, as they retrain for a new career or take time out for family. But natural \\nunemployment should be consistently low and not affect the productivity of the \\neconomy. \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  16 \\nUnemployment also shows that the economy is not efficient, because it is not able to put \\nall its productive human resources to work. \\nThe employment rate, or the participation rate of the labor force, shows how \\nsuccessful an economy is at creating opportunities to sell labor and efficiently using its \\nhuman resources. A healthy market economy uses its labor productively, is productive, \\nand provides employment opportunities as well as consumer satisfaction through its \\nmarkets. Figure 1.6 \"Cyclical Economic Effects\" shows the relationship between GDP \\nand unemployment and each stage of the business cycle. \\nFigure 1.6 Cyclical Economic Effects \\n \\nAt either end of this scale of growth, the economy is in an unsustainable position: either \\ngrowing too fast, with too much demand for labor, or shrinking, with too little demand \\nfor labor. \\nIf there is too much demand for labor— more jobs than workers to fill them— then wages \\nwill rise, pushing up the cost of everything and causing prices to rise. Prices usually rise \\nfaster than wages, for many reasons, which would discourage consumption that would \\neventually discourage production and cause the economy to slow down from its “boom” \\ncondition into a more manageable rate of growth. \\nIf there is too little demand for labor— more workers than jobs— then wages will fall or, \\nmore typically, there will be people without jobs, or unemployment. If wages become \\nlow enough, employers theoretically will be encouraged to hire more labor, which would \\nbring employment levels back up. However, it doesn’t always work that way, because \\npeople have job mobility— they are willing and able to move between economies to seek \\nemployment. \\nIf unemployment is high and prolonged, then too many people are without wages for too \\nlong, and they are not able to participate in the economy because they have nothing to \\ntrade. In that case, the market economy is just not working for too many people, and \\nthey will eventually demand a change (which is how most revolutions have started). \\nOther Indicators of Economic Health \\nOther economic indicators give us clues as to how “successful” our economy is, how well \\nit is growing, or how well positioned it is for future growth. These indicators include \\nstatistics, such as the number of houses being built or existing home sales, orders for \\n'),\n",

However, GDP growth and unemployment are the two most closely \\nwatched indicators, because they get at the heart of what our economy is supposed to \\naccomplish: to provide diverse opportunities for the most people to participate in the \\neconomy, to create jobs, and to satisfy the consumption needs of the most people by \\nenabling them to get what they want. \\nAn expanding and healthy economy will offer more choices to participants: more choices \\nfor trading labor and for trading capital. It offers more opportunities to earn a return or \\nan income and therefore also offers more diversification and less risk. \\nNaturally, everyone would rather operate in a healthier economy at all times, but this is \\nnot always possible. Financial planning must include planning for the risk that \\neconomic factors will affect financial realities. A recession may increase unemployment, \\nlowering the return on labor— wages— or making it harder to anticipate an increase in \\nincome. Wage income could be lost altogether. Such temporary involuntary loss of wage \\nincome probably will happen to you during your lifetime, as you inevitably will endure \\neconomic cycles. \\nA hedge against lost wages is investment to create other forms of income. In a period of \\neconomic contraction, however, the usefulness of capital, and thus its value, may decline \\nas well. Some businesses and industries are considered immune to economic cycles \\n(e.g., public education and health care), but overall, investment returns may suffer. \\nThus, during your lifetime business cycles will likely affect your participation in the \\ncapital markets as well. \\nCurrency Value \\nStable currency value is another important indicator of a healthy economy and a critical \\nelement in financial planning. Like anything else, the value of a currency is based on its \\nusefulness. We use currency as a medium of exchange, so the value of a currency is \\nbased on how it can be used in trade, which in turn is based on what is produced in the \\neconomy. If an economy produces little that anyone wants, then its currency has little \\nvalue relative to other currencies, because there is little use for it in trade. So a \\ncurrency’s value is an indicator of how productive an economy is. \\nA currency’s usefulness is based on what it can buy, or its purchasing power. The \\nmore a currency can buy, the more useful and valuable it is. When prices rise or when \\nthings cost more, purchasing power decreases; the currency buys less and its value \\ndecreases. \\nWhen the value of a currency decreases, an economy has inflation. Its currency has \\nless value because it is less useful; that is, less can be bought with it. Prices are rising. It \\ntakes more units of currency to buy the same amount of goods. When the value of a \\ncurrency increases, on the other hand, an economy has deflation. Prices are falling; the \\ncurrency is worth more and buys more. '),\n",

Each game is worth $4, or each \\ndollar buys ¼ of a game. Then we have inflation, and prices— including the price of \\nvideo games— rise. A year later you want to buy games, but now your $20 only buys two \\ngames. Each one costs $10, or each dollar only buys one-tenth of a game. Rising prices \\nhave eroded the purchasing power of your dollars. \\nIf there is deflation, prices fall, so maybe a year later you could buy ten video games with \\nyour same $20. Now each game costs only $2, and each dollar buys half a game. The \\nsame amount of currency buys more games: its purchasing power has increased, as has \\nits usefulness and its value (Figure 1.7 \"Dynamics of Currency Value\"). \\nFigure 1.7 Dynamics of Currency Value \\n \\nInflation is most commonly measured by the consumer price indexA measure of \\ninflation or deflation based on a national average of prices for a “basket” of common \\ngoods and services purchased by the average consumer. (CPI), an index created and \\ntracked by the federal government. It measures the average nationwide prices of a \\n“basket” of goods and services purchased by the average consumer. It is an accepted way \\nof tracking rising or falling price levels, indicative of inflation or deflation.

Say you lend $100 to your sister, who is supposed to pay you back \\none year from now. There is inflation, so over the next year, the value of the dollar \\ndecreases (it buys less as prices rise). Your sister does indeed pay you back on time, but \\nnow the $100 that she gives back to you is worth less (because it buys less) than the \\n$100 you gave her. Your investment, although nominally returned, has lost value: you \\nhave your $100 back, but you can’t do as much with it; it is less useful. \\nIf the value of currency— the units in which wealth is measured and stored— is unstable, \\nthen investment returns are harder to predict. In those circumstances, investment \\ninvolves more risk. Both inflation and deflation are currency instabilities that are \\ntroublesome for an economy and also for the financial planning process. An unstable \\ncurrency affects the value or purchasing power of income. Price changes affect \\nconsumption decisions, and changes in currency value affect investing decisions. \\nIt is human nature to assume that things will stay the same, but financial planning must \\ninclude the assumption that over a lifetime you will encounter and endure economic \\ncycles. You should try to anticipate the risks of an economic downturn and the possible \\nloss of wage income and/or investment income. At the same time, you should not \\nassume or rely on the windfalls of an economic expansion. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Business cycles include periods of expansion and contraction (including recessions), as measured \\nby the economy’s productivity (gross domestic product). \\n• An economy is in an unsustainable situation when it grows too fast or too slowly, as each situation \\ncauses too much stress in the economy’s markets. \\n• In addition to GDP, measures of the health of an economy include  \\no the rates of employment and unemployment, \\no the value of currency (the consumer price index). \\n• Financial planning should take into account the fact that periods of inflation or deflation change \\nthe value of currency, affecting purchasing power and investment values.  \\n• Thus, personal financial planning should take into account \\no business cycles, \\no changes in the economy’s productivity, \\no changes in the currency value, \\no changes in other economic indicators.

According to a popular model, to be truly useful goals must be Specific, \\nMeasurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely (S.M.A.R.T.). Goals change over time, and \\ncertainly over a lifetime. Whatever your goals, however, life is complicated and risky, \\nand having a plan and a method to reach your goals increases the odds of doing so. \\nFor example, after graduating from college, Alice has an immediate focus on earning \\nincome to provide for living expenses and debt (student loan) obligations.

Her income will have to provide for \\nher increased expenses and also generate a surplus that can be saved to accumulate \\nthese assets. \\nIn the long term, she will want to be able to retire and derive all her income from her \\naccumulated assets, and perhaps travel around the world in a sailboat. She will have to \\nhave accumulated enough assets to provide for her retirement income and for the travel. \\nFigure 1.10 \"Timing, Goals, and Income\" shows the relationship between timing, goals, \\nand sources of income. \\nFigure 1.10 Timing, Goals, and Income \\n \\nAlice’s income will be used to meet her goals, so it’s important for her to understand \\nwhere her income will be coming from and how it will help in achieving her goals.

There may be many \\nchoices, but you want to identify those that will be most useful in reaching your goals. \\nAssessing the current situation is a matter of organizing personal financial information \\ninto summaries that can clearly show different and important aspects of financial life—\\nyour assets, debts, incomes, and expenses. These numbers are expressed in financial \\nstatements— in an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement (topics \\ndiscussed in Chapter 3 \"Financial Statements\"). Businesses also use these three types of \\nstatements in their financial planning. \\nFor now, we can assess Alice’s simple situation by identifying her assets and debts and \\nby listing her annual incomes and expenses. That will show if she can expect a budget \\nsurplus or deficit, but more important, it will show how possible her goals are and \\n'),\n",

Even a ballpark assessment of the current \\nsituation can be illuminating. \\nAlice’s assets may be a car worth about $5,000 and a savings account with a balance of \\n$250. Debts include a student loan with a balance of $53,000 and a car loan with a \\nbalance of $2,700; these are shown in Figure 1.11 \"Alice’s Financial Situation\". \\nFigure 1.11 Alice’s Financial Situation \\n \\nHer annual disposable income (after-tax income or take-home pay) may be $35,720, \\nand annual expenses are expected to be $10,800 for rent and $14,400 for living \\nexpenses— food, gas, entertainment, clothing, and so on. Her annual loan payments are \\n$2,400 for the car loan and $7,720 for the student loan, as shown in Figure 1.12 \"Alice’s \\nIncome and Expenses\". \\nFigure 1.12 Alice’s Income and Expenses \\n \\n'),\n",

She will be achieving her short-term goal of \\nreducing debt, but with a small annual budget surplus, it will be difficult for her to begin \\nto achieve her goal of accumulating assets. \\nTo reach that intermediate goal, she will have to increase income or decrease expenses \\nto create more of an annual surplus. When her car loan is paid off next year, she hopes \\nto buy another car, but she will have at most only $650 (250 + 400) in savings for a \\ndown payment for the car, and that assumes she can save all her surplus. When her \\nstudent loans are paid off in about five years, she will no longer have student loan \\npayments, and that will increase her surplus significantly (by $7,720 per year) and allow \\nher to put that money toward asset accumulation. \\nAlice’s long-term goals also depend on her ability to accumulate productive assets, as \\nshe wants to be able to quit working and live on the income from her assets in \\nretirement. Alice is making progress toward meeting her short-term goals of reducing \\ndebt, which she must do before being able to work toward her intermediate and long-\\nterm goals. Until she reduces her debt, which would reduce her expenses and increase \\nher income, she will not make progress toward her intermediate and long-term goals. \\nAssessing her current situation allows Alice to see that she has to delay accumulating \\nassets until she can reduce expenses by reducing debt (and thus her student loan \\npayments). She is now reducing debt, and as she continues to do so, her financial \\nsituation will begin to look different, and new choices will be available to her. \\nAlice learned about her current situation from two simple lists: one of her assets and \\ndebts and the other of her income and expenses. Even in this simple example it is clear \\nthat the process of articulating the current situation can put information into a very \\nuseful context. It can reveal the critical paths to achieving goals. \\nEvaluating Alternatives and Making Choices \\nFiguring out how to go from here to there is a process of identifying immediate choices \\nand longer-term strategies or series of choices. To do this, you have to be realistic and \\nyet imaginative about your current situation to see the choices it presents and the future \\nchoices that current choices may create. The characteristics of your living situation—\\nfamily structure, age, career choice, health— and the larger context of the economic \\nenvironment will affect or define the relative value of your choices. \\nAfter you have identified alternatives, you evaluate each one. The obvious things to look \\nfor and assess are its costs and benefits, but you also want to think about its risks, where \\nit will leave you, and how well positioned it will leave you to make the next decision. You \\nwant to have as many choices as you can at any point in the process, and you want your \\nchoices to be well diversified. That way, you can choose with an understanding of how \\nthis choice will affect the next choices and the next. The further along in the process you \\ncan think, the better you can plan. '),\n",

She \\ncould begin to accumulate assets sooner, and thus perhaps more of them, if she could \\nreduce expenses to create more of a budget surplus. Alice looks over her expenses and \\ndecides she really can’t cut them back much. She decides that the alternative of reducing \\nexpenses is not feasible. She could increase income, however. She has two choices: work \\na second job or go to Las Vegas to play poker. \\nAlice could work a second, part-time job that would increase her after-tax income but \\nleave her more tired and with less time for other interests. The economy is in a bit of a \\nslump too— unemployment is up a bit— so her second job probably wouldn’t pay much. \\nShe could go to Vegas and win big, with the cost of the trip as her only expense. To \\nevaluate her alternatives, Alice needs to calculate the benefits and costs of each (Figure \\n1.13 \"Alice’s Choices: Benefits and Costs\"). \\nFigure 1.13 Alice’s Choices: Benefits and Costs \\n \\nLaying out Alice’s choices in this way shows their consequences more clearly. The \\nalternative with the biggest benefit is the trip to Vegas, but that also has the biggest cost \\nbecause it has the biggest risk: if she loses, she could have even more debt. That would \\nput her further from her goal of beginning to accumulate assets, which would have to be \\npostponed until she could eliminate that new debt as well as her existing debt. \\nThus, she would have to increase her income and decrease her expenses. Simply \\ncontinuing as she does now would no longer be an option because the new debt \\nincreases her expenses and creates a budget deficit. Her only remaining alternative to \\nincrease income would be to take the second job that she had initially rejected because \\nof its implicit cost. She would probably have to reduce expenses as well, an idea she \\ninitially rejected as not even being a reasonable choice. Thus, the risk of the Vegas \\noption is that it could force her to “choose” alternatives that she had initially rejected as \\ntoo costly. \\n'),\n",

When you have got a little, it is often easy to get \\nmore. The great difficulty is to get that little. \\nAdam Smith, The Wealth of Nations[1]  \\nPersonal finance addresses the “great difficulty” of getting a little money. It is about \\nlearning to manage income and wealth to satisfy desires in life or to create more income \\nand more wealth. It is about creating productive assetsResources that can be used to \\ncreate future economic benefit, such as increasing income, decreasing expenses, or \\nstoring wealth, as an investment. and about protecting existing and expected value in \\nthose assets. In other words, personal finance is about learning how to get what you \\nwant and how to protect what you’ve got. \\nThere is no trick to managing personal finances. Making good financial decisions is \\nlargely a matter of understanding how the economy works, how money flows through it, \\nand how people make financial decisions. The better your understanding, the better \\nyour ability to plan, take advantage of opportunities, and avoid disappointments. Life \\ncan never be planned entirely, of course, and the best-laid plans do go awry, but \\nanticipating risks and protecting against them can minimize exposure to the inevitable \\nmistakes and “the hazards and vicissitudes”[2] of life. \\n[1] Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations (New York: The Modern Library, 2000), Book I, \\nChapter ix.

Define opportunity and sunk costs and discuss their effects on financial decision making.  \\nPersonal finance is the process of paying for or financing a life and a way of living. Just \\nas a business must be financed— its buildings, equipment, use of labor and materials, \\nand operating costs must be paid for— so must a person’s possessions and living \\nexpenses. Just as a business relies on its revenues from selling goods or services to \\nfinance its costs, so a person relies on income earned from selling labor or capital to \\nfinance costs. You need to understand this financing process and the terms used to \\ndescribe it. In the next chapter, you’ll look at how to account for it. \\nWhere Does Income Come From? \\nIncome is what is earned or received in a given period. There are various terms for \\nincome because there are various ways of earning income. Income from employment or \\nself-employment is wages or salary. Deposit accounts, like savings accounts, earn \\ninterest, which could also come from lending. Owning stock entitles the shareholder to a \\ndividend, if there is one. Owning a piece of a partnership or a privately held corporation \\nentitles one to a draw. \\nThe two fundamental ways of earning income in a market-based economy are by selling \\nlabor or selling capital. Selling labor means working, either for someone else or for \\nyourself. Income comes in the form of a paycheck. Total compensation may include \\nother benefits, such as retirement contributions, health insurance, or life insurance. \\nLabor is sold in the labor market. \\nSelling capital means investing: taking excess cash and selling it or renting it to someone \\nwho needs liquidity (access to cash). Lending is renting out capital; the interest is the \\nrent. You can lend privately by direct arrangement with a borrower, or you can lend \\nthrough a public debt exchange by buying corporate, government, or government \\nagency bonds. Investing in or buying corporate stock is an example of selling capital in \\nexchange for a share of the company’s future value. \\nYou can invest in many other kinds of assets, like antiques, art, coins, land, or \\ncommodities such as soybeans, live cattle, platinum, or light crude oil. The principle is \\nthe same: investing is renting capital or selling it for an asset that can be resold later, or \\nthat can create future income, or both. Capital is sold in the capital market and lent in \\nthe credit market— a specific part of the capital market (just like the dairy section is a \\nspecific part of the supermarket). Figure 2.2 \"Sources of Income\" shows the sources of \\nincome. \\n \\n \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  34 \\nFigure 2.2 Sources of Income \\n \\nIn the labor market, the price of labor is the wage that an employer (buyer of labor) is \\nwilling to pay to the employee (seller of labor). For any given job, that price is \\ndetermined by many factors. The nature of the work defines the education and skills \\nrequired, and the price may reflect other factors as well, such as the status or desirability \\nof the job. \\nIn turn, the skills needed and the attractiveness of the work determine the supply of \\nlabor for that particular job— the number of people who could and would want to do the \\njob. If the supply of labor is greater than the demand, if there are more people to work at \\na job than are needed, then employers will have more hiring choices. That labor market \\nis a buyers’ market, and the buyers can hire labor at lower prices. If there are fewer \\npeople willing and able to do a job than there are jobs, then that labor market is a sellers’ \\nmarket, and workers can sell their labor at higher prices. \\nSimilarly, the fewer skills required for the job, the more people there will be who are \\nable to do it, creating a buyers’ market. The more skills required for a job, the fewer \\npeople there will be to do it, and the more leverage or advantage the seller has in \\nnegotiating a price. People pursue education to make themselves more highly skilled \\nand therefore able to compete in a sellers’ labor market. \\nWhen you are starting your career, you are usually in a buyers’ market (unless you have \\nsome unusual gift or talent), if only because of your lack of experience. As your career \\nprogresses, you have more, and perhaps more varied, experience and presumably more \\nskills, and so can sell your labor in more of a sellers’ market. You may change careers or \\njobs more than once, but you would hope to be doing so to your advantage, that is, \\nalways to be gaining bargaining power in the labor market. \\nMany people love their work for many reasons other than the pay, however, and choose \\nit for those rewards. Labor is more than a source of income; it is also a source of many \\nintellectual, social, and other personal gratifications. Your labor nevertheless is also a \\ntradable commodity and has a market value. The personal rewards of your work may \\nultimately determine your choices, but you should be aware of the market value of those \\nchoices as you make them. \\n'),\n",

Most people would like to reach a point where they don’t have to sell labor at \\nall. They hope to retire someday and pursue other hobbies or interests. They can retire if \\nthey have alternative sources of income— if they can earn income from savings and from \\nselling capital. \\nCapital markets exist so that buyers can buy capital. Businesses always need capital and \\nhave limited ways of raising it. Sellers and lenders (investors), on the other hand, have \\nmany more choices of how to invest their excess cash in the capital and credit markets, \\nso those markets are much more like sellers’ markets. The following are examples of \\nways to invest in the capital and credit markets: \\n• Buying stocks \\n• Buying government or corporate bonds \\n• Lending a mortgage \\nThe market for any particular investment or asset may be a sellers’ or buyers’ market at \\nany particular time, depending on economic conditions. For example, the market for \\nreal estate, modern art, sports memorabilia, or vintage cars can be a buyers’ market if \\nthere are more sellers than buyers. Typically, however, there is as much or more \\ndemand for capital as there is supply. The more capital you have to sell, the more ways \\nyou can sell it to more kinds of buyers, and the more those buyers may be willing to pay. \\nAt first, however, for most people, selling labor is their only practical source of income. \\nWhere Does Income Go? \\nExpenses are costs for items or resources that are used up or consumed in the course \\nof daily living. Expenses recur (i.e., they happen over and over again) because food, \\nhousing, clothing, energy, and so on are used up on a daily basis. \\nWhen income is less than expenses, you have a budget deficit too little cash to provide \\nfor your wants or needs. A budget deficit is not sustainable; it is not financially viable. \\nThe only choices are to eliminate the deficit by (1) increasing income, (2) reducing \\nexpenses, or (3) borrowing to make up the difference. Borrowing may seem like the \\neasiest and quickest solution, but borrowing also increases expenses, because it creates \\nan additional expense: interest. Unless income can also be increased, borrowing to cover \\na deficit will only increase it. \\nBetter, although usually harder, choices are to increase income or decrease expenses. \\nFigure 2.3 \"Budget Deficit\" shows the choices created by a budget deficit. \\n \\n '),\n",

That \\nsituation is sustainable and remains financially viable. You could choose to decrease \\nincome by, say, working less. More likely, you would use the surplus in one of two ways: \\nconsume more or save it. If consumed, the income is gone, although presumably you \\nenjoyed it. \\nIf saved, however, the income can be stored, perhaps in a piggy bank or cookie jar, and \\nused later. A more profitable way to save is to invest it in some way— deposit in a bank \\naccount, lend it with interest, or trade it for an asset, such as a stock or a bond or real \\nestate. Those ways of saving are ways of selling your excess capital in the capital markets \\nto increase your wealth. The following are examples of savings: \\n1. Depositing into a statement savings account at a bank \\n2. Contributing to a retirement account \\n3. Purchasing a certificate of deposit (CD) \\n4. Purchasing a government savings bond \\n5.

Suppose you can afford a new jacket or new boots, but not both, because \\nyour resources— the income you can use to buy clothing— are limited. If you buy the \\njacket, you cannot also buy the boots. Not getting the boots is an opportunity cost of \\nbuying the jacket; it is cost of sacrificing your next best choice. \\nIn personal finance, there is always an opportunity cost. You always want to make a \\nchoice that will create more value than cost, and so you always want the opportunity \\ncost to be less than the benefit from trade. You bought the jacket instead of the boots \\nbecause you decided that having the jacket would bring more benefit than the cost of not \\nhaving the boots. You believed your benefit would be greater than your opportunity cost. \\nIn personal finance, opportunity costs affect not only consumption decisions but also \\nfinancing decisions, such as whether to borrow or to pay cash. Borrowing has obvious \\ncosts, whereas paying with your own cash or savings seems costless. Using your cash \\ndoes have an opportunity cost, however. You lose whatever interest you may have had \\non your savings, and you lose liquidity— that is, if you need cash for something else, like \\na better choice or an emergency, you no longer have it and may even have to borrow it at \\na higher cost. \\nWhen buyers and sellers make choices, they weigh opportunity costs, and sometimes \\nregret them, especially when the benefits from trade are disappointing. Regret can color \\nfuture choices. Sometimes regret can keep us from recognizing sunk costs. \\nSunk costs are costs that have already been spent; that is, whatever resources you traded \\nare gone, and there is no way to recover them. Decisions, by definition, can be made \\nonly about the future, not about the past. A trade, when it’s over, is over and done, so \\nrecognizing that sunk costs are truly sunk can help you make better decisions. \\nFor example, the money you spent on your jacket is a sunk cost. If it snows next week \\nand you decide you really do need boots, too, that money is gone, and you cannot use it \\nto buy boots. If you really want the boots, you will have to find another way to pay for \\nthem. \\nUnlike a price tag, opportunity cost is not obvious. You tend to focus on what you are \\ngetting in the trade, not on what you are not getting. This tendency is a cheerful aspect \\nof human nature, but it can be a weakness in the kind of strategic decision making that \\nis so essential in financial planning. Human nature also may make you focus too much \\non sunk costs, but all the relish or regret in the world cannot change past decisions. \\nLearning to recognize sunk costs is important in making good financial decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• It is important to understand the sources (incomes) and uses (expenses) of funds, and the budget \\ndeficit or budget surplus that may result.

Identify the purposes and uses of assets. \\n2. Identify the types of assets. \\n3. Explain the role of assets in personal finance. \\n4. Explain how a capital gain or loss is created. \\nAs defined earlier in this chapter, an asset is any item with economic value that can be \\nconverted to cash. Assets are resources that can be used to create income or reduce \\nexpenses and to store value. The following are examples of tangible (material) assets: \\n• Car \\n• Savings account \\n• Wind-up toy collection \\n• Money market account \\n• Shares of stock \\n• Forty acres of farmland \\n• Home \\nWhen you sell excess capital in the capital markets in exchange for an asset, it is a way of \\nstoring wealth, and hopefully of generating income as well. The asset is your \\ninvestment— a use of your liquidity. Some assets are more liquid than others. For \\nexample, you can probably sell your car more quickly than you can sell your house. As \\nan investor, you assume that when you want your liquidity back, you can sell the asset. \\nThis assumes that it has some liquidity and market value (some use and value to \\nsomeone else) and that it trades in a reasonably efficient market. Otherwise, the asset is \\nnot an investment, but merely a possession, which may bring great happiness but will \\nnot serve as a store of wealth. \\nAssets may be used to store wealth, create income, and reduce future expenses. \\nAssets Store Wealth \\nIf the asset is worth more when it is resold than it was when it was bought, then you \\nhave earned a capital gain: the investment has not only stored wealth but also \\nincreased it. Of course, things can go the other way too: the investment can decrease in \\nvalue while owned and be worth less when resold than it was when bought. In that case, \\nyou have a capital loss. The investment not only did not store wealth, it lost some. \\nFigure 2.7 \"Gains and Losses\" shows how capital gains and losses are created. \\nFigure 2.7 Gains and Losses '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  40 \\n \\nThe better investment asset is the one that increases in value— creates a capital gain—\\nduring the time you are storing it. \\nAssets Create Income \\nSome assets not only store wealth but also create income. An investment in an \\napartment house stores wealth and creates rental income, for example. An investment in \\na share of stock stores wealth and also perhaps creates dividend income. A deposit in a \\nsavings account stores wealth and creates interest income. \\nSome investors care more about increasing asset value than about income. For example, \\nan investment in a share of corporate stock may produce a dividend, which is a share of \\nthe corporation’s profit, or the company may keep all its profit rather than pay \\ndividends to shareholders. Reinvesting that profit in the company may help the \\ncompany to increase in value. If the company increases in value, the stock increases in \\nvalue, increasing investors’ wealth. Further, increases in wealth through capital gains \\nare taxed differently than income, making capital gains more valuable than an increase \\nin income for some investors. \\nOn the other hand, other investors care more about receiving income from their \\ninvestments. For example, retirees who no longer have employment income may be \\nrelying on investments to provide income for living expenses. Being older and having a \\nshorter horizon, retirees may be less concerned with growing wealth than with creating \\nincome. \\nAssets Reduce Expenses \\nSome assets are used to reduce living expenses. Purchasing an asset and using it may be \\ncheaper than arranging for an alternative. For example, buying a car to drive to work \\nmay be cheaper, in the long run, than renting one or using public transportation. The \\ncar typically will not increase in value, so it cannot be expected to be a store of wealth; \\nits only role is to reduce future expenses. \\nSometimes an asset may be expected to both store wealth and reduce future expenses. \\nFor example, buying a house to live in may be cheaper, in the long run, than renting one. \\nIn addition, real estate may appreciate in value, allowing you to realize a gain when you \\nsell the asset. In this case, the house has effectively stored wealth. Appreciation in value \\ndepends on the real estate market and demand for housing when the asset is sold, \\n'),\n",

Still, a house usually can reduce living expenses and \\nbe a potential store of wealth. \\nFigure 2.8 \"Assets and the Roles of Assets\" shows the roles of assets in reducing \\nexpenses, increasing income, and storing wealth. \\nFigure 2.8 Assets and the Roles of Assets \\n \\nThe choice of investment asset, then, depends on your belief in its ability to store and \\nincrease wealth, create income, or reduce expenses. Ideally, your assets will store and \\nincrease wealth while increasing income or reducing expenses. Otherwise, acquiring the \\nasset will not be a productive use of liquidity. Also, in that case the opportunity cost will \\nbe greater than the benefit from the investment, since there are many assets to choose \\nfrom. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Assets are items with economic value that can be converted to cash. You use excess liquidity or \\nsurplus cash to buy an asset and store wealth until you resell the asset.  \\n• An asset can create income, reduce expenses, and store wealth. \\n• To have value as an investment, an asset must either store wealth or create income (reduce \\nexpenses); ideally, an asset can do both. \\n'),\n",

Compare and contrast the benefits and costs of debt and equity. \\n3. Illustrate the uses of debt and equity. \\n4. Analyze the costs of debt and of equity. \\nBuying capital, that is, borrowing enables you to invest without first owning capital. By \\nusing other people’s money to finance the investment, you get to use an asset before \\nactually owning it, free and clear, assuming you can repay out of future earnings. \\nBorrowing capital has costs, however, so the asset will have to increase wealth, increase \\nearnings, or decrease expenses enough to compensate for its costs. In other words, the \\nasset will have to be more productive to earn enough to cover its financing costs— the \\ncost of buying or borrowing capital to buy the asset. \\nBuying capital gives you equity, borrowing capital gives you debt, and both kinds of \\nfinancing have costs and benefits. When you buy or borrow liquidity or cash, you \\nbecome a buyer in the capital market. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  43 \\nThe Costs of Debt and Equity \\nYou can buy capital from other investors in exchange for an ownership share or equity, \\nwhich represents your claim on any future gains or future income. If the asset is \\nproductive in storing wealth, generating income, or reducing expenses, the equity holder \\nor shareholder or owner enjoys that benefit in proportion to the share of the asset \\nowned. If the asset actually loses value, the owner bears a portion of the loss in \\nproportion to the share of the asset owned. The cost of equity is in having to share the \\nbenefits from the investment. \\nFor example, in 2004 Google, a company that produced a very successful Internet \\nsearch engine, decided to buy capital by selling shares of the company (shares of stock \\nor equity securities) in exchange for cash. Google sold over 19 million shares for a total \\nof $1.67 billion. Those who bought the shares were then owners or shareholders of \\nGoogle, Inc. Each shareholder has equity in Google, and as long as they own the shares \\nthey will share in the profits and value of Google, Inc. The original founders and owners \\nof Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have since had to share their company’s gains (or \\nincome) or losses with all those shareholders. In this case, the cost of equity is the \\nminimum rate of return Google must offer its shareholders to compensate them for \\nwaiting for their returns and for bearing some risk that the company might not do as \\nwell in the future. \\nBorrowing is renting someone else’s money for a period of time, and the result is debt. \\nDuring that period of time, rent or interest be paid, which is a cost of debt. When that \\nperiod of time expires, all the capital (the principal amount borrowed) must be given \\nback. The investment’s earnings must be enough to cover the interest, and its growth in \\nvalue must be enough to return the principal. Thus, debt is a liability, an obligation for \\nwhich the borrower is liable. \\nIn contrast, the cost of equity may need to be paid only if there is an increase in income \\nor wealth, and even then can be deferred. So, from the buyer’s point of view, purchasing \\nliquidity by borrowing (debt) has a more immediate effect on income and expenses. \\nInterest must be added as an expense, and repayment must be anticipated. \\nFigure 2.9 \"Sources of Capital\" shows the implications of equity and debt as the sources \\nof capital. \\nFigure 2.9 Sources of Capital '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  44 \\n \\nThe Uses of Debt and Equity \\nDebt is a way to make an investment that could not otherwise be made, to buy an asset \\n(e.g., house, car, corporate stock) that you couldn’t buy without borrowing. If that asset \\nis expected to provide enough benefit (i.e., increase value or create income or reduce \\nexpense) to compensate for its additional costs, then the debt is worth it. However, if \\ndebt creates additional expense without enough additional benefit, then it is not worth \\nit. The trouble is, while the costs are usually known up front, the benefits are not. That \\nadds a dimension of risk to debt, which is another factor in assessing whether it’s \\ndesirable. \\nFor example, after the housing boom began to go bust in 2008, homeowners began \\nlosing value in their homes as housing prices dropped. Some homeowners are in the \\nunfortunate position of owing more on their mortgage than their house is currently \\nworth. The costs of their debt were knowable upfront, but the consequences— the house \\nlosing value and becoming worth less than the debt— were not. \\nDebt may also be used to cover a budget deficit, or the excess of expenses over income. \\nAs mentioned previously, however, in the long run the cost of the debt will increase \\nexpenses that are already too big, which is what created the deficit in the first place. \\nUnless income can also be increased, debt can only aggravate a deficit. \\nThe Value of Debt \\nThe value of debt includes the benefits of having the asset sooner rather than later, \\nsomething that debt financing enables. For example, many people want to buy a house \\nwhen they have children, perhaps because they want bedrooms and bathrooms and \\nmaybe a yard for their children. Not far into adulthood, would-be homebuyers may not \\nhave had enough time to save enough to buy the house outright, so they borrow to make \\nup the difference. Over the length of their mortgage (real estate loan), they pay the \\ninterest. \\nThe alternative would be to rent a living space. If the rent on a comparable home were \\nmore than the mortgage interest (which it often is, because a landlord usually wants the \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  45 \\nrent to cover the mortgage and create a profit), it would make more sense, if possible, to \\nborrow and buy a home and be able to live in it. And, extra bedrooms and bathrooms \\nand a yard are valuable while children are young and live at home. If you wait until you \\nhave saved enough to buy a home, you may be much older, and your children may be off \\non their own. \\nAnother example of the value of debt is using debt to finance an education. Education is \\nvaluable because it has many benefits that can be enjoyed over a lifetime. One benefit is \\nan increase in potential earnings in wages and salaries. Demand for the educated or \\nmore skilled employee is generally greater than for the uneducated or less-skilled \\nemployee. So education creates a more valuable and thus higher-priced employee. \\nIt makes sense to be able to maximize value by becoming educated as soon as possible \\nso that you have as long as possible to benefit from increased income. It even makes \\nsense to invest in an education before you sell your labor because your opportunity cost \\nof going to school— in this case, the “lost” wages of not working— is lowest. Without \\nincome or savings (or very little) to finance your education, typically, you borrow. Debt \\nenables you to use the value of the education to enhance your income, out of which you \\ncan pay back the debt. \\nThe alternative would be to work and save and then get an education, but you would be \\nearning income less efficiently until you completed your education, and then you would \\nhave less time to earn your return. Waiting decreases the value of your education, that \\nis, its usefulness, over your lifetime. \\nIn these examples (Figure 2.11 \"Debt: Uses, Value, and Cost\"), debt creates a cost, but it \\nreduces expenses or increases income to offset that cost. Debt allows this to happen \\nsooner than it otherwise could, which allows you to realize the maximum benefit for the \\ninvestment. In such cases, debt is “worth” it. \\nFigure 2.11 Debt: Uses, Value, and Cost \\n \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n'),\n",

Describe how sources of income may be diversified. \\n2. Describe how investments in assets may be diversified. \\n3. Explain the use of diversification as a risk management strategy.  \\nPersonal finance is not just about getting what you want; it is also about protecting what \\nyou have. Since the way to accumulate assets is to create surplus capital by having an \\nincome larger than expenses, and since you rely on income to provide for living \\nexpenses, you also need to think about protecting your income. One way to do so is \\nthrough diversification, or spreading the risk. \\nYou already know not to put all your eggs in one basket, because if something happens \\nto that basket, all the eggs are gone. If the eggs are in many baskets, on the other hand, \\nthe loss of any one basket would mean the loss of just a fraction of the eggs. The more \\nbaskets, the smaller your proportional loss would be. Then if you put many different \\nbaskets in many different places, your eggs are diversified even more effectively, because \\nall the baskets aren’t exposed to the same environmental or systematic risks. \\nDiversification is more often discussed in terms of investment decisions, but \\ndiversification of sources of income works the same way and makes the same kind of \\nsense for the same reasons. If sources of income are diverse— in number and kind— and \\none source of income ceases to be productive, then you still have others to rely on. \\nIf you sell your labor to only one buyer, then you are exposed to more risk than if you \\ncan generate income by selling your labor to more than one buyer. You have only so \\nmuch time you can devote to working, however. Having more than one employer could \\nbe exhausting and perhaps impossible. Selling your labor to more than one buyer also \\nmeans that you are still dependent on the labor market, which could suffer from an \\neconomic cycle such as a recession affecting many buyers (employers). \\nMark, for example, works as a school counselor, tutors on the side, paints houses in the \\nsummers, and buys and sells sports memorabilia on the Internet. If he got laid off from \\nhis counseling job, he would lose his paycheck but still be able to create income by \\ntutoring, painting, and trading memorabilia. \\nSimilarly, if you sell your capital to only one buyer— invest in only one asset— then you \\nare exposed to more risk than if you generate income by investing in a variety of assets. \\nDiversifying investments means you are dependent on trade in the capital markets, \\nhowever, which likewise could suffer from unfavorable economic conditions. '),\n",

If his stock portfolio lost value, he would still have the value in his money \\nmarket account. \\nA better way to diversify sources of income is to sell both labor and capital. Then you are \\ntrading in different markets, and are not totally exposed to risks in either one. In Mark’s \\ncase, if all his incomes dried up, he would still have his investments, and if all his \\ninvestments lost value, he would still have his paycheck and other incomes. To diversify \\nto that extent, you need surplus capital to trade. This brings us full circle to Adam \\nSmith, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, who said, essentially, “It takes money to \\nmake money.” \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\nDiversifying sources of income in both the labor market and the capital markets is the best hedge \\nagainst risks in any one market. \\nEXERCISE  \\nRecord your answers to the following questions in your personal finance journal or My Notes. \\nHow can you diversify your sources of income to spread the risk of losing income?

Measuring by counting, by adding it all up, by \\ntaking stock, is probably as old as any human activity. In recorded history, there are \\n“accounts” on clay tablets from ancient Sumeria dating from ca. 3,700 BC.[1]  \\nSince the first shepherd counted his sheep, there has been accounting. \\nIn financial planning, assessing the current situation, or figuring out where you are at \\npresent, is crucial to determining any sort of financial plan. This assessment becomes \\nthe point of departure for any strategy. It becomes the mark from which any progress is \\nmeasured, the principal from which any return is calculated. It can determine the \\npractical or realistic goals to have and the strategies to achieve them. Eventually, the \\ncurrent situation becomes a time forgotten with the pride of success, or remembered \\nwith the regret of failure. \\nUnderstanding the current situation is not just a matter of measuring it, but also of \\nputting it in perspective and in context, relative to your own past performance and \\nfuture goals, and relative to the realities in the economic world around you. Tools for \\nunderstanding your current situation are your accounting and financial statements. \\n[1] Gary Giroux, http://acct.tamu.edu/giroux/AncientWorld.html (accessed January 19, \\n2009).  \\n3.1 Accounting and Financial Statements \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1.

Trace how a bankruptcy can occur. \\nClay tablets interested Sumerian traders because the records gave them a way to see \\ntheir financial situation and to use that insight to measure progress and plan for the \\nfuture. The method of accounting universally used in business today is known as \\naccrual accounting, in which events are accounted for even if cash does not change \\nhands. That is, transactions are recorded at the time they occur rather than when \\npayment is actually made or received. Anticipated or preceding payments and receipts \\n(cash flows) are recorded as accrued or deferred. Accrual accounting is the opposite of \\ncash accounting, in which transactions are recognized only when cash is exchanged. \\nAccrual accounting defines earning as an economic event signified by an exchange of \\ngoods rather than by an exchange of cash. In this way, accrual accounting allows for the \\nseparation in time of the exchange of goods and the exchange of cash. A transaction can \\nbe completed over time and distance, which allows for extended— and extensive— trade. \\nAnother advantage of accrual accounting is that it gives a business a more accurate \\npicture of its present situation in reality. \\nModern accounting techniques developed during the European Age of Discovery, which \\nwas motivated by ever-expanding trade. Both the principles and the methods of modern \\naccrual accounting were first published in a text by Luca Pacioli in 1494,[1] although \\nthey were probably developed even before that. These methods of “keeping the books” \\ncan be applied to personal finance today as they were to trading in the age of long \\nvoyages for pepper and cloves, and with equally valuable results. \\nNevertheless, in personal finance it almost always makes more sense to use cash \\naccounting, to define and account for events when the cash changes hands. So in \\npersonal finance, incomes and expenses are noted when the cash is received or paid, or \\nwhen the cash flows. \\nThe Accounting Process \\nFinancial decisions result in transactions, actual trades that buy or sell, invest or \\nborrow. In the market economy, something is given up in order to get something, so \\neach trade involves at least one thing given up and one thing gotten— two things flowing \\nin at least two directions. The process of accounting records these transactions and \\nrecords what has been gotten and what has been given up to get it, what flows in and \\nwhat flows out. \\nIn business, accounting journals and ledgers are set up to record transactions as they \\nhappen. In personal finance, a checkbook records most transactions, with statements \\nfrom banks or investment accounts providing records of the rest. Periodically, the \\ntransaction information is summarized in financial statements so it can be read most \\nefficiently. '),\n",

Since the advent of \\naccounting software, bookkeeping, like long division and spelling, has become \\nsomewhat obsolete, although human judgment is still required. What is more \\ninteresting and useful are the summary reports that can be produced once all this \\ninformation is recorded: the income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet. \\nIncome Statement \\nThe income statement summarizes incomes and expenses for a period of time. In \\nbusiness, income is the value of whatever is sold, expenses are the costs of earning that \\nincome, and the difference is profit. In personal finance, income is what is earned as \\nwages or salary and as interest or dividends, and expenses are the costs of things \\nconsumed in the course of daily living: the costs of sustaining you while you earn \\nincome. Thus, the income statement is a measure of what you have earned and what \\nyour cost of living was while earning it. The difference is personal profit, which, if \\naccumulated as investment, becomes your wealth. \\nThe income statement clearly shows the relative size of your income and expenses. If \\nincome is greater than expenses, there is a surplus, and that surplus can be used to save \\nor to spend more (and create more expenses). If income is less than expenses, then there \\nis a deficit that must be addressed. If the deficit continues, it creates debts— unpaid \\nbills— that must eventually be paid. Over the long term, a deficit is not a viable scenario. \\nThe income statement can be useful for its level of detail too. You can see which of your \\nexpenses consumes the greatest portion of your income or which expense has the \\ngreatest or least effect on your bottom line. If you want to reduce expenses, you can see \\nwhich would have the greatest impact or would free up more income if you reduced it. If \\nyou want to increase income, you can see how much more that would buy you in terms \\nof your expenses (Figure 3.3 \"Alice’s Situation (in Dollars)\"). For example, consider \\nAlice’s situation per year. \\nFigure 3.3 Alice’s Situation (in Dollars) \\n \\nShe also had car payments of $2,400 and student loan payments of $7,720. Each loan \\npayment actually covers the interest expense and partial repayment of the loan. The \\ninterest is an expense representing the cost of borrowing, and thus of having, the car \\nand the education. The repayment of the loan is not an expense, however, but is just \\ngiving back something that was borrowed. In this case, the loan payments break down \\nas follows (Figure 3.4 \"Alice’s Loan Payments (Annually)\"). \\n'),\n",

Alice’s net income, or net earnings or personal profit, is the \\nremaining income after all other expenses have been deducted, in this case $6,040. \\nNow Alice has a much clearer view of what’s going on in her financial life. She can see, \\nfor example, that living expenses take the biggest bite out of her income and that rent is \\nthe biggest single expense. If she wanted to decrease expenses, finding a place to live \\nwith a cheaper rent will make the most impact on her bottom line. Or perhaps it would \\nmake more sense to make many small changes rather than one large change, to cut back \\non several other expenses. She could begin by cutting back on the expense items that she \\nfeels are least necessary or that she could most easily live without. Perhaps she could do \\nwith less entertainment or clothing or travel, for example. Whatever choices she \\nsubsequently made would be reflected in her income statement. The value of the income \\nstatement is in presenting income and expenses in detail for a particular period of time. \\nCash Flow Statement \\nThe cash flow statement shows how much cash came in and where it came from, and \\nhow much cash went out and where it went over a period of time. This differs from the \\nincome statement because it may include cash flows that are not from income and \\nexpenses. Examples of such cash flows would be receiving repayment of money that you \\nloaned, repaying money that you borrowed, or using money in exchanges such as buying \\nor selling an asset. \\nThe cash flow statement is important because it can show how well you do at creating \\nliquidity, as well as your net income. Liquidity is nearness to cash, and liquidity has \\nvalue. An excess of liquidity can be sold or lent, creating additional income. A lack of \\nliquidity must be addressed by buying it or borrowing, creating additional expense. \\nLooking at Alice’s situation, she has two loan repayments that are not expenses and so \\nare not included on her income statement. These payments reduce her liquidity, \\nhowever, making it harder for her to create excess cash. Her cash flow statement looks \\nlike this (Figure 3.6 \"Alice’s Cash Flow Statement for the Year 2009\"). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

A negative number is cash flowing out, and a positive number is cash flowing in. \\nConventionally, negative numbers are in parentheses. \\nAs with the income statement, the cash flow statement is more useful if there are \\nsubtotals for the different kinds of cash flows, as defined by their sources and uses. The \\ncash flows from income and expenses are operating cash flows, or cash flows that are \\na consequence of earning income or paying for the costs of earning income. The loan \\nrepayments are cash flows from financing assets or investments that will increase \\nincome. In this case, cash flows from financing include repayments on the car and the \\neducation. Although Alice doesn’t have any in this example, there could also be \\ncash flows from investing, from buying or selling assets. Free cash flow is the cash \\navailable to make investments or financing decisions after taking care of operations and \\ndebt obligations. It is calculated as cash flow from operations less debt repayments. \\nThe most significant difference between the three categories of cash flows— operating, \\ninvesting, or financing— is whether or not the cash flows may be expected to recur \\nregularly.

Operating cash flows may be different amounts in different periods, but they will \\nhappen in every period. Investing and financing cash flows, on the other hand, may or \\nmay not recur and often are unusual events. Typically, for example, you would not \\nborrow or lend or buy or sell assets in every year. Here is how Alice’s cash flows would \\nbe classified (Figure 3.7 \"Alice’s Cash Flow Statement for the Year 2009\"). \\nFigure 3.7 Alice’s Cash Flow Statement for the Year 2009 \\n \\nThis cash flow statement more clearly shows how liquidity is created and where liquidity \\ncould be increased. If Alice wanted to create more liquidity, it is obvious that eliminating \\nthose loan payments would be a big help: without them, her net cash flow would \\nincrease by more than 3,900 percent. \\nBalance Sheet \\nIn business or in personal finance, a critical piece in assessing the current situation is \\nthe balance sheet. Often referred to as the “statement of financial condition,” the \\n'),\n",

Unlike the income or cash flow statements, it is not a record of performance over a \\nperiod of time, but simply a statement of where things stand at a certain moment. \\nThe balance sheet is a list of assets, debts or liabilities, and equity or net worth, with \\ntheir values. In business, assets are resources that can be used to create income, while \\ndebt and equity are the capital that financed those assets. Thus, the value of the assets \\nmust equal the value of the debt and the equity. In other words, the value of the \\nbusiness’s resources must equal the value of the capital it borrowed or bought in order \\nto get those resources. \\nassets = liabilities + equity  \\nIn business, the accounting equation is as absolute as the law of gravity. It simply \\nmust always be true, because if there are assets, they must have been financed \\nsomehow— either through debt or equity. The value of that debt and equity financing \\nmust equal or balance the value of the assets it bought. Thus, it is called the “balance” \\nsheet because it always balances the debt and equity with the value of the assets. \\nIn personal finance, assets are also things that can be sold to create liquidity. Liquidity is \\nneeded to satisfy or repay debts. Because your assets are what you use to satisfy your \\ndebts when they become due, the assets’ value should be greater than the value of your \\ndebts. That is, you should have more to work with to meet your obligations than you \\nowe. \\nThe difference between what you have and what you owe is your net worth. Literally, \\nnet worth is the share that you own of everything that you have. It is the value of what \\nyou have net of (less) what you owe to others. Whatever asset value is left over after you \\nmeet your debt obligations is your own worth. It is the value of what you have that you \\ncan claim free and clear. \\nassets − debt = net worth  \\nYour net worth is really your equity or financial ownership in your own life. Here, too, \\nthe personal balance sheet must balance, because if \\nassets − debts = net worth,  \\nthen it should also be \\nassets = debts + net worth.  \\nAlice could write a simple balance sheet to see her current financial condition. She has \\ntwo assets (her car and her savings account), and she has two debts (her car and student \\nloans) (Figure 3.8 \"Alice’s Balance Sheet, December 31, 2009\"). \\n '),\n",

If \\nliabilities<assets then assets − liabilities>0; net worth>0 (net worth is positive) If \\nliabilities>assets then assets − liabilities<0; net worth<0 (net worth is negative)  \\nNegative net worth implies that the assets don’t have enough value to satisfy the debts. \\nSince debts are obligations, this would cause some concern. \\nNet Worth and Bankruptcy \\nIn business, when liabilities are greater than the assets to meet them, the business has \\nnegative equity and is literally bankrupt. In that case, it may go out of business, selling \\nall its assets and giving whatever it can to its creditors or lenders, who will have to \\nsettle for less than what they are owed. More usually, the business continues to operate \\nin bankruptcy, if possible, and must still repay its creditors, although perhaps under \\nsomewhat easier terms. Creditors (and the laws) allow these terms because creditors \\nwould rather get paid in full later than get paid less now or not at all. \\nIn personal finance, personal bankruptcy may occur when debts are greater than the \\nvalue of assets. But because creditors would rather be paid eventually than never, the \\nbankrupt is usually allowed to continue to earn income in the hopes of repaying the debt \\nlater or with easier terms. Often, the bankrupt is forced to liquidate (sell) some or all of \\nits assets. \\nBecause debt is a legal as well as an economic obligation, there are laws governing \\nbankruptcies that differ from state to state in the United States and from country to \\ncountry. Although debt forgiveness was discussed in the Old Testament, throughout \\n'),\n",

It is not listed on her \\nbalance sheet because the value of her education, like the value of any asset, comes from \\nhow useful it is, and its usefulness has not happened yet, but will happen over her \\nlifetime. It will happen in her future, based on how she chooses to use her education to \\nincrease her income and wealth. It is difficult to assign a monetary value to her \\neducation now. Alice knows what she paid for her education, but, sensibly, its real value \\nis not its cost but its potential return, or what it can earn for her as she puts it to use in \\nthe future. \\nCurrent studies show that a college education has economic value, because a college \\ngraduate earns more over a lifetime than a high school graduate. Recent estimates put \\nthat difference at about $1,000,000.[3]  \\nSo, if Alice assumes that her education will be worth $1,000,000 in extra income over \\nher lifetime, and she includes that asset value on her balance sheet, then it would look \\nmore like this (Figure 3.10 \"Alice’s Balance Sheet (revised), December 31, 2009\"): \\nFigure 3.10 Alice’s Balance Sheet (revised), December 31, 2009 \\n \\nThis looks much better, but it’s not sound accounting practice to include an asset—and \\nits value— on the balance sheet before it really exists. After all, education generally pays \\noff, but until it does, it hasn’t yet and there is a chance, however slim, that it won’t for \\nAlice. A balance sheet is a snapshot of one’s financial situation at one particular time. At \\nthis particular time, Alice’s education has value, but its amount is unknown. \\nIt is easy to see, however, that the only thing that creates negative net worth for Alice is \\nher student loan. The student loan causes her liabilities to be greater than her assets—\\nand if that were paid off, her net worth would be positive. Given that Alice is just \\nstarting her adult earning years, her situation seems quite reasonable. \\n'),\n",

Current \\nconditions are shown on the balance sheet. \\n• The income statement lists income and expenses. \\n• The cash flow statement lists three kinds of cash flows: operating (recurring), financing \\n(nonrecurring), and investing (nonrecurring). \\n• The balance sheet lists assets, liabilities (debts), and net worth. \\n• Net worth = assets − debts. \\n• Bankruptcy occurs when there is negative net worth, or when debts are greater than assets.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1. Prepare a personal income statement for the past year, using the same format as Alice’s income \\nstatement in this chapter. Include all relevant categories of income and expenses. What does your \\nincome statement tell you about your current financial situation? For example, where does your \\nincome come from, and where does it go? Do you have a surplus of income over expenses? If, so \\nwhat are you doing with the surplus? Do you have a deficit? What can you do about that? Which \\nof your expenses has the greatest effect on your bottom line? What is the biggest expense? Which \\nexpenses would be easiest to reduce or eliminate? How else could you reduce expenses? \\nRealistically, how could you increase your income? How would you like your income statement \\nfor the next year to look? \\n2. Using the format for Alice’s cash flow statement, prepare your cash flow statement for the same \\none-year period. Include your cash flows from all sources in addition to your operating cash \\nflows— the income and expenses that appear on your income statement. What, if any, were the \\ncash flows from financing and the cash flows from investing? Which of your cash flows are \\nrecurring, and which are nonrecurring? What does your cash flow statement tell you about your \\ncurrent financial situation? If you wanted to increase your liquidity, what would you try to change \\nabout your cash flows? '),\n",

Now prepare a balance sheet, again based on Alice’s form. List all your assets, liabilities and \\ndebts, and your equity from all sources. What does the balance sheet show about your financial \\nsituation at this moment in time? What is your net worth? Do you have positive or negative net \\nworth at this time, and what does that mean? To increase your liquidity, how would your balance \\nsheet need to change? What would be the relationship between your cash flow st atement and your \\nbudget? \\n4. Read the CNNMoney.com article “How Much Are You Worth?” (October 3, 2003, by Les Christie, \\nathttp://money.cnn.com/2003/09/30/pf/millionaire/networth/), and use the data and \\ncalculator to determine your net worth. How does you net worth compare to that of other \\nAmericans in your age and income brackets? \\n5. The Small Business Administration’s Personal Financial Statement combines features of an \\nincome statement and a balance sheet. You would fill out a similar form if you were applying for a \\npersonal or business loan at bank or mortgage lender.

Demonstrate how changes in the balance sheet may be explained by changes on the income and \\ncash flow statements. \\n4. Identify the purposes and uses of ratio analysis. \\n5. Describe the uses of comparing financial statements over time.  \\nFinancial statements are valuable summaries of financial activities because they can \\norganize information and make it easier and clearer to see and therefore to understand. \\nEach one— the income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet— conveys a \\ndifferent aspect of the financial picture; put together, the picture is pretty complete. The \\nthree provide a summary of earning and expenses, of cash flows, and of assets and \\ndebts. \\nSince the three statements offer three different kinds of information, sometimes it is \\nuseful to look at each in the context of the others, and to look at specific items in the \\nlarger context. This is the purpose of financial statement analysis: creating comparisons \\nand contexts to gain a better understanding of the financial picture. \\nCommon-Size Statements \\nOn common-size statements, each item’s value is listed as a percentage of another. \\nThis compares items, showing their relative size and their relative significance (see \\nFigure 3.11 \"Common Common-Size Statements\"). On the income statement, each \\nincome and expense may be listed as a percentage of the total income. This shows the \\ncontribution of each kind of income to the total, and thus the diversification of income. \\nIt shows the burden of each expense on total income or how much income is needed to \\nsupport each expense. \\nOn the cash flow statement, each cash flow can be listed as a percentage of total positive \\ncash flows, again showing the relative significance and diversification of the sources of \\ncash, and the relative size of the burden of each use of cash. \\nOn the balance sheet, each item is listed as a percentage of total assets, showing the \\nrelative significance and diversification of assets, and highlighting the use of debt as \\nfinancing for the assets. \\nFigure 3.11 Common Common-Size Statements \\n \\n'),\n",

This shows her how much of her income, proportionately, is \\nused up for each expense (Figure 3.12 \"Alice’s Common-Size Income Statement for the \\nYear 2009\"). \\nFigure 3.12 Alice’s Common-Size Income Statement for the Year 2009 \\n \\nSeeing the common-size statement as a pie chart makes the relative size of the slices \\neven clearer (Figure 3.13 \"Pie Chart of Alice’s Common-Size Income Statement for the \\nYear 2009\"). \\nFigure 3.13 Pie Chart of Alice’s Common-Size Income Statement for the Year 2009 \\n \\n'),\n",

Her income tax expense is a big use of her wages, but it is \\nunavoidable or nondiscretionary. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., \\nsaid, “Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.”[1]  \\nRanking expenses by size offers interesting insight into lifestyle choices. It is also \\nvaluable in framing financial decisions, pointing out which expenses have the largest \\nimpact on income and thus on the resources for making financial decisions. If Alice \\nwanted more discretionary income to make more or different choices, she can easily see \\nthat reducing rent expense would have the most impact on freeing up some of her wages \\nfor another use. \\nCommon-Size Cash Flow Statement \\nLooking at Alice’s negative cash flows as percentages of her positive cash flow (on the \\ncash flow statement), or the uses of cash as percentages of the sources of cash, creates \\nthe common-size cash flows. As with the income statement, this gives Alice a clearer \\nand more immediate view of the largest uses of her cash (Figure 3.14 \"Alice’s Common-\\nSize Cash Flow Statement for the Year 2009\" and Figure 3.15 \"Pie Chart of Alice’s \\nCommon-Size Cash Flow Statement\"). \\nFigure 3.14 Alice’s Common-Size Cash Flow Statement for the Year 2009 \\n \\n \\n \\n'),\n",

Repayments and interest together are 30 \\npercent of Alice’s cash— as much as she pays for rent and food. Eliminating those debt \\npayments would create substantial liquidity for Alice. \\nCommon-Size Balance Sheet \\nOn the balance sheet, looking at each item as a percentage of total assets allows for \\nmeasuring how much of the assets’ value is obligated to cover each debt, or how much of \\nthe assets’ value is claimed by each debt (Figure 3.16 \"Alice’s Common-Size Balance \\nSheet, December 31, 2009\"). \\nFigure 3.16 Alice’s Common-Size Balance Sheet, December 31, 2009 \\n \\nThis common-size balance sheet allows “over-sized” items to be more obvious.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  65 \\nCommon-size statements allow you to look at the size of each item relative to a common \\ndenominator: total income on the income statement, total positive cash flow on the cash \\nflow statement, or total assets on the balance sheet. The relative size of the items helps \\nyou spot anything that seems disproportionately large or small. The common-size \\nanalysis is also useful for comparing the diversification of items on the financial \\nstatement— the diversification of incomes on the income statement, cash flows on the \\ncash flow statement, and assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Diversification \\nreduces risk, so you want to diversify the sources of income and assets you can use to \\ncreate value (Figure 3.17 \"Pie Chart of Alice’s Common-Size Balance Sheet: The Assets\"). \\nFigure 3.17 Pie Chart of Alice’s Common-Size Balance Sheet: The Assets \\n \\nFor example, Alice has only two assets, and one— her car— provides 95 percent of her \\nassets’ value. If something happened to her car, her assets would lose 95 percent of their \\nvalue. Her asset value would be less exposed to risk if she had asset value from other \\nassets to diversify the value invested in her car. \\nLikewise, both her income and her positive cash flows come from only one source, her \\npaycheck. Because her positive net earnings and positive net cash flows depend on this \\none source, she is exposed to risk, which she could decrease by diversifying her sources \\nof income. She could diversify by adding earned income— taking on a second job, for \\nexample— or by creating investment income. In order to create investment income, \\nhowever, she needs to have a surplus of liquidity, or cash, to invest. Alice has run head \\nfirst into Adam Smith’s “great difficulty”[2]  \\n(that it takes some money to make money; see Chapter 2 \"Basic Ideas of Finance\"). \\nRelating the Financial Statements \\nCommon-size statements put the details of the financial statements in clear relief \\nrelative to a common factor for each statement, but each financial statement is also \\n'),\n",

Each is a piece of a larger picture, and as important as it is to see \\neach piece, it is also important to see that larger picture. To make sound financial \\ndecisions, you need to be able to foresee the consequences of a decision, to understand \\nhow a decision may affect the different aspects of the bigger picture. \\nFor example, what happens in the income statement and cash flow statements is \\nreflected on the balance sheet because the earnings and expenses and the other cash \\nflows affect the asset values, and the values of debts, and thus the net worth. Cash may \\nbe used to purchase assets, so a negative cash flow may increase assets. Cash may be \\nused to pay off debt, so a negative cash flow may decrease liabilities. Cash may be \\nreceived when an asset is sold, so a decrease to assets may create positive cash flow. \\nCash may be received when money is borrowed, so an increase in liabilities may create a \\npositive cash flow. \\nThere are many other possible scenarios and transactions, but you can begin to see that \\nthe balance sheet at the end of a period is changed from what it was at the beginning of \\nthe period by what happens during the period, and what happens during the period is \\nshown on the income statement and the cash flow statement. So, as shown in the figure, \\nthe income statement and cash flow information, related to each other, also relate the \\nbalance sheet at the end of the period to the balance sheet at the beginning of the period \\n(Figure 3.18 \"Relationships Among Financial Statements\"). \\nFigure 3.18 Relationships Among Financial Statements \\n \\nThe significance of these relationships becomes even more important when evaluating \\nalternatives for financial decisions. When you understand how the statements are \\nrelated, you can use that understanding to project the effects of your choices on different \\naspects of your financial reality and see the consequences of your decisions. \\nRatio Analysis \\nCreating ratios is another way to see the numbers in relation to each other. Any ratio \\nshows the relative size of the two items compared, just as a fraction compares the \\nnumerator to the denominator or a percentage compares a part to the whole. The \\npercentages on the common-size statements are ratios, although they only compare \\n'),\n",

Ratio analysis is used to make comparisons across \\nstatements. For example, you can see how much debt you have just by looking at your \\ntotal liabilities, but how can you tell if you can afford the debt you have? That depends \\non the income you have to meet your interest and repayment obligations, or the assets \\nyou could use (sell) to meet those obligations. Ratio analysis can give you the answer. \\nThe financial ratios you use depend on the perspective you need or the question(s) \\nyou need answered. Some of the more common ratios (and questions) are presented in \\nthe following chart (Figure 3.19 \"Common Personal Financial Ratios\"). \\nFigure 3.19 Common Personal Financial Ratios \\n \\nThese ratios all get “better” or show improvement as they get bigger, with two \\nexceptions: debt to assets and total debt. Those two ratios measure levels of debt, and \\nthe smaller the ratio, the less the debt. Ideally, the two debt ratios would be less than \\none. If your debt-to-assets ratio is greater than one, then debt is greater than assets, and \\nyou are bankrupt. If the total debt ratio is greater than one, then debt is greater than net \\nworth, and you “own” less of your assets’ value than your creditors do. \\nSome ratios will naturally be less than one, but the bigger they are, the better. For \\nexample, net income margin will always be less than one because net income will always \\nbe less than total income (net income = total income − expenses). The larger that ratio is \\nand the fewer expenses that are taken away from the total income, the better. \\n'),\n",

She \\ncan see how much larger her debt is than her assets by looking at her debt-to-assets \\nratio. Although she has a lot of debt (relative to assets and to net worth), she can earn \\nenough income to cover its cost or interest expense, as shown by the interest coverage \\nratio. \\nAlice is earning well. Her income is larger than her assets. She is able to live efficiently. \\nHer net income is a healthy 13.53 percent of her total income (net income margin), \\nwhich means that her expenses are only 86.47 percent of it, but her cash flows are much \\nless (cash flow to income), meaning that a significant portion of earnings is used up in \\nmaking investments or, in Alice’s case, debt repayments. In fact, her debt repayments \\ndon’t leave her with much free cash flow; that is, cash flow not used up on living \\nexpenses or debts. \\nLooking at the ratios, it is even more apparent how much— and how subtle— a burden \\nAlice’s debt is. In addition to giving her negative net worth, it keeps her from increasing \\nher assets and creating positive net worth— and potentially more income— by obligating \\nher to use up her cash flows. Debt repayment keeps her from being able to invest. \\nCurrently, Alice can afford the interest and the repayments. Her debt does not keep her \\nfrom living her life, but it does limit her choices, which in turn restricts her decisions \\nand future possibilities. \\nComparisons over Time \\n'),\n",

Comparisons over time provide insights into the effects of past \\nfinancial decisions and changes in circumstance. That insight can guide you in making \\nfuture financial decisions, particularly in foreseeing the potential costs or benefits of a \\nchoice. Looking backward can be very helpful in looking forward. \\nFast-forward ten years: Alice is now in her early thirties. Her career has progressed, and \\nher income has grown. She has paid off her student loan and has begun to save for \\nretirement and perhaps a down payment on a house. \\nA comparison of Alice’s financial statements shows the change over the decade, both in \\nabsolute dollar amounts and as a percentage (see Figure 3.22 \"Alice’s Income \\nStatements: Comparison Over Time\", Figure 3.23 \"Alice’s Cash Flow Statements: \\nComparison Over Time\", and Figure 3.24 \"Alice’s Balance Sheets: Comparison Over \\nTime\").

Overall, her net income, or personal profit, what \\nshe clears after covering her living expenses, has almost doubled. \\nHer cash flows have also improved. Operating cash flows, like net income, have almost \\ndoubled—due primarily to eliminating the student loan interest payment. The improved \\ncash flow allowed her to make a down payment on a new car, invest in her 401(k), make \\nthe payments on her car loan, and still increase her net cash flow by a factor of ten. \\nAlice’s balance sheet is most telling about the changes in her life, especially her now \\npositive net worth. She has more assets. She has begun saving for retirement and has \\nmore liquidity, distributed in her checking, savings, and money market accounts. Since \\nshe has less debt, having paid off her student loan, she now has positive net worth. \\nComparing the relative results of the common-size statements provides an even deeper \\nview of the relative changes in Alice’s situation (Figure 3.25 \"Comparing Alice’s \\nCommon-Size Statements for 2009 and 2019: Income Statements\", Figure 3.26 \\n\"Comparing Alice’s Common-Size Statements for 2009 and 2019: Cash Flow \\nStatements\", and Figure 3.27 \"Comparing Alice’s Common-Size Statements for 2009 \\nand 2019: Balance Sheets\"). \\nFigure 3.25 Comparing Alice’s Common-Size Statements for 2009 and 2019: Income \\nStatements \\n \\n  \\n'),\n",

Interest expense has decreased \\nsubstantially as a portion of income, resulting in a net income or personal profit that is \\nnot only larger, but is larger relative to income. More of her income is profit, left for \\nother discretionary uses. \\nThe change in operating cash flows confirms this. Although her investing activities now \\nrepresent a significant use of cash, her need to use cash in financing activities— debt \\nrepayment— is so much less that her net cash flow has increased substantially. The cash \\nthat used to have to go toward supporting debt obligations now goes toward building an \\nasset base, some of which (the 401(k)) may provide income in the future. \\nChanges in the balance sheet show a much more diversified and therefore much less \\nrisky asset base. Although almost half of Alice’s assets are restricted for a specific \\npurpose, such as her 401(k) and Individual Retirement Account (IRA) accounts, she still \\nhas significantly more liquidity and more liquid assets.

Identify the uses of personal finance software. \\n2. List the common features of personal financial software. \\n3. Demonstrate how actual financial calculations may be accomplished using personal financial \\nsoftware. \\n4. Discuss how personal financial software can assist in your personal financial decisions.  \\nMany software products are available to help you organize your financial information to \\nbe more useful in making financial decisions. They are designed to make the record-\\nkeeping aspects of personal finance— the collection, classification, and sorting of \\nfinancial data— as easy as possible. The programs also are designed to produce summary \\nreports (e.g., income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets) as well as \\nmany calculations that may be useful for various aspects of financial planning. For \\nexample, financial planning software exists for managing education and retirement \\nsavings, debt and mortgage repayment, and income and expense budgeting. \\nCollecting the Data \\nMost programs have designed their data input to look like a checkbook, which is what \\nmost people use to keep personal financial records. This type of user interface is \\nintended to be recognizable and familiar, similar to the manual record keeping that you \\nalready do. \\nWhen you input your checkbook data into the program, the software does the \\nbookkeeping— creating the journals, ledgers, adjustments, and trial balances that \\ngenerations of people have done, albeit more tediously, with parchment and quill or \\nwith ledger paper and pencil. Most personal financial transactions happen as cash flows \\nthrough a checking account, so the checkbook becomes the primary source of data. \\nMore and more, personal transactions are done by electronic transfer; that is, no paper \\nchanges hands, but cash still flows to and from an account, usually a checking account. \\nData for other transactions, such as income from investments or changes in investment \\nvalue, are usually received from periodic statements issued by investment managers, \\nsuch as banks where you have savings accounts; brokers or mutual fund companies that \\nmanage investments; or employers’ retirement account statements. \\nMost versions of personal financial software allow you to download account information \\ndirectly from the source— your bank, broker, or employer— which saves you from \\nmanually entering the data into the program. Aside from providing convenience, \\ndownloading directly should eliminate human error in transferring the data. \\nReporting Results and Planning Ahead '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  78 \\nAll personal financial software produces the essential summary reports— the income \\nstatement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet— that show the results of financial \\nactivity for the period. Most will also report more specific aspects of activities, such as \\nlisting all transactions for a particular income or expense. \\nMost will provide separate reports on activities that have some tax consequence, since \\nusers always need to be aware of tax obligations and the tax consequences of financial \\ndecisions. Some programs, especially those produced by companies that also sell tax \\nsoftware, allow you to export data from your financial software to your tax program, \\nwhich makes tax preparation— or at least tax record keeping— easier. In some programs, \\nyou need to know which activities are taxable and flag them as such. Some programs \\nrecognize that information already, while others may still prompt you for tax \\ninformation. \\nAll programs allow you to play “what if”: a marvelous feature of computing power and \\nthe virtual world in general and certainly helpful when it comes to making financial \\ndecisions. All programs include a budgeting feature that allows you to foresee or project \\npossible scenarios and gauge your ability to live with them. This feature is particularly \\nuseful when budgeting for income and living expenses. (Budgeting is discussed more \\nthoroughly in Chapter 5 \"Financial Plans: Budgets\".) Most programs have features that \\nallow you to project the results of savings plans for education or retirement. None can \\ndictate the future, or allow you to, but they can certainly help you to have a better view. \\nSecurity, Benefits, and Costs \\nAll programs are designed to be installed on a personal computer or a handheld device \\nsuch as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or smart phone, but some can also be run \\nfrom a Web site and therefore do not require a download. Product and service providers \\nare very concerned with security. \\nAs with all Internet transactions, you should be aware that the more your data is \\ntransferred, downloaded, or exported over the Internet, the more exposed it is to theft. \\nPersonal financial data theft is a serious and growing problem worldwide, and security \\nsystems are hard pressed to keep up with the ingenuity of hackers. The convenience \\ngained by having your bank, brokerage, tax preparer, and so on accessible to you (and \\nyour data accessible to them) or your data accessible to you wherever you are must be \\nweighed against the increased exposure to data theft. As always, the potential benefit \\nshould be considered against the costs. \\nKeeping digital records of your finances may be more secure than keeping them \\nscattered in shoeboxes or files, exposed to risks such as fire, flood, and theft. Digital \\nrecords are often easily retrievable because the software organizes them systematically \\nfor you. Space is not a practical issue with digital storage, so records may be kept longer. \\nAs with anything digital, however, you must be diligent about backing up your data, \\nalthough many programs will do that automatically or regularly prompt you to do so. \\nHard copy records must be disposed of periodically, and judging how long to keep them '),\n",

Throwing them in the trash may be risky because of “dumpster \\ndiving,” a well-known method of identity theft, so documents with financial information \\nshould always be shredded before disposal. \\nPersonal financial software is usually quite reasonably priced, with many programs \\nselling for less than $50, and most for less than $100.

As much as analysis may tell us \\nabout the outcomes of past decisions, the past is “sunk”: it can be known but not decided \\nupon. Decisions are made about the future, which cannot be known with certainty, so \\nevaluating alternatives for financial decisions always involves speculation on both the \\nkind of result and the value of the result that will occur. It also involves understanding \\nand measuring the risks or uncertainties that time presents and the opportunities— and \\nopportunity costs— that time creates. \\n[1] Robert Frost, “Neither Out Far Nor In Deep,” Selected Poems of Robert Frost (New \\nYork: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1963).  \\n4.1 The Time Value of Money \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Explain the value of liquidity. \\n2. Demonstrate how time creates distance, risk, and opportunity cost.  \\n3. Demonstrate how time affects liquidity. \\n4. Analyze how time affects value. \\nPart of the planning process is evaluating the possible future results of a decision. Since \\nthose results will occur some time from now (i.e., in the future), it is critical to \\nunderstand how time passing may affect those benefits and costs— not only the \\nprobability of their occurrence, but also their value when they do. Time affects value \\nbecause time affects liquidity. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  83 \\nLiquidity is valuable, and the liquidity of an asset affects its value: all things being equal, \\nthe more liquid an asset is, the better. This relationship— how the passage of time affects \\nthe liquidity of money and thus its value— is commonly referred to as the \\ntime value of money, which can actually be calculated concretely as well as \\nunderstood abstractly. \\nSuppose you went to Mexico, where the currency is the peso. Coming from the United \\nStates, you have a fistful of dollars. When you get there, you are hungry. You see and \\nsmell a taco stand and decide to have a taco. Before you can buy the taco, however, you \\nhave to get some pesos so that you can pay for it because the right currency is needed to \\ntrade in that market. You have wealth (your fistful of dollars), but you don’t have wealth \\nthat is liquid. In order to change your dollars into pesos and acquire liquidity, you need \\nto exchange currency. There is a fee to exchange your currency: a transaction cost, \\nwhich is the cost of simply making the trade. It also takes a bit of time, and you could be \\ndoing other things, so it creates an opportunity cost (see Chapter 2 \"Basic Ideas of \\nFinance\"). There is also the chance that you won’t be able to make the exchange for \\nsome reason, or that it will cost more than you thought, so there is a bit of risk involved. \\nObtaining liquidity for your wealth creates transaction costs, opportunity costs, and risk. \\nIn general, transforming not-so-liquid wealth into liquid wealth creates transaction \\ncosts, opportunity costs, and risk, all of which take away from the value of wealth. \\nLiquidity has value because it can be used without any additional costs. \\nOne dimension of difference between not-so-liquid wealth and liquidity is time. Cash \\nflows (CF) in the past are sunk, cash flows in the present are liquid, and cash flows in \\nthe future are not yet liquid. You can only make choices with liquid wealth, not with \\ncash that you don’t have yet or that has already been spent. Separated from your \\nliquidity and your choices by time, there is an opportunity cost: if you had liquidity now, \\nyou could use it for consumption or investment and benefit from it now. There is also \\nrisk, as there is always some uncertainty about the future: whether or not you will \\nactually get your cash flows and just how much they’ll be worth when you do. \\nThe further in the future cash flows are, the farther away you are from your liquidity, the \\nmore opportunity cost and risk you have, and the more that takes away from the present \\nvalue (PV) of your wealth, which is not yet liquid. In other words, time puts distance \\nbetween you and your liquidity, and that creates costs that take away from value. The \\nmore time there is, the larger its effect on the value of wealth. \\nFinancial plans are expected to happen in the future, so financial decisions are based on \\nvalues some distance away in time. You could be trying to project an amount at some \\npoint in the future— perhaps an investment payout or college tuition payment. Or \\nperhaps you are thinking about a series of cash flows that happen over time— for \\nexample, annual deposits into and then withdrawals from a retirement account. To \\nreally understand the time value of those cash flows, or to compare them in any \\nreasonable way, you have to understand the relationships between the nominal or face \\nvalues in the future and their equivalent, present values (i.e., what their values would be \\nif they were liquid today). The equivalent present values today will be less than the '),\n",

Discuss the use of the algebraic expression in evaluating the relationship b etween present and \\nfuture values. \\n4. Explain the importance of understanding the relationships among the factors that affect future \\nvalue. \\nFinancial calculation is not often a necessary skill since it is easier to use calculators, \\nspreadsheets, and software. However, understanding the calculations is important in \\nunderstanding the relationships between time, risk, opportunity cost, and value. \\nTo do the math, you need to know \\n• what the future cash flows (CF) will be, \\n• when the future cash flows will be, \\n• the rate at which time affects value (e.g., the costs per time period, or the \\nmagnitude [the size or amount] of the effect of time on value). '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  85 \\nIt is usually not difficult to forecast the timing and amounts of future cash flows. \\nAlthough there may be some uncertainty about them, gauging the rate at which time \\naffects money can require some judgment. That rate, commonly called the \\ndiscount rate because time discounts value, is the opportunity cost of not having \\nliquidity. Opportunity cost derives from forgone choices or sacrificed alternatives, and \\nsometimes it is not clear what those might have been (see Chapter 2 \"Basic Ideas of \\nFinance\"). It is an important judgment call to make, though, because the rate will \\ndirectly affect the valuation process. \\nAt times, the alternatives are clear: you could be putting the liquidity in an account \\nearning 3 percent, so that’s your opportunity cost of not having it. Or you are paying 6.5 \\npercent on a loan, which you wouldn’t be paying if you had enough liquidity to avoid \\nhaving to borrow; so that’s your opportunity cost. Sometimes, however, your \\nopportunity cost is not so clear. \\nSay that today is your twentieth birthday. Your grandparents have promised to give you \\n$1,000 for your twenty-first birthday, one year from today. If you had the money today, \\nwhat would it be worth? That is, how much would $1,000 worth of liquidity one year \\nfrom now be worth today? \\nThat depends on the cost of its not being liquid today, or on the opportunity costs and \\nrisks created by not having liquidity today. If you had $1,000 today, you could buy \\nthings and enjoy them, or you could deposit it in an interest-bearing account. So on your \\ntwenty-first birthday, you would have more than $1,000. You would have the $1,000 \\nplus whatever interest it had earned. If your bank pays 4 percent per year (interest rates \\nare always stated as annual rates) on your account, then you would earn $40 of interest \\nin the next year, or $1,000 × .04. So on your twenty-first birthday you would have \\n$1,040. \\n$1,000+(1,000×0.04)=$1,000×(1+0.04)=$1,040  \\nFigure 4.4  \\n \\nIf you left that amount in the bank until your twenty-second birthday, you would have \\n1,040+(1,040×0.04)=1,040×(1+0.04) =[1,000×(1+0.04)] × (1+0.04) =1,000×(1+0.04) \\n2 =1,081.60.  \\nTo generalize the computation, if your present value, or PV, is your value today, r is \\nthe rate at which time affects value or discount rate (in this case, your interest rate), and \\n'),\n",

Your only cost of not having liquidity now is the opportunity cost \\nof having to delay consumption or not earning the interest you could have earned. \\nThe cost of delayed consumption is largely derived from a subjective valuation of \\nwhatever is consumed, or its utility or satisfaction. The more value you place on having \\nsomething, the more it “costs” you not to have it, and the more the time that you are \\nwithout it affects its value. \\nAssuming that if you had the money today you would save it (as it’s much harder to \\nquantify your joy from consumption), by having to wait to get it until your twenty-first \\nbirthday— and not having it today— you miss out on $40 it could have earned. \\nSo, what would that nominal $1,000 (that future value that you get one year from now) \\nactually be worth today? The rate at which time affects your value is 4 percent because \\nthat’s what having a choice (spend it or invest it) could earn for you if only you had \\nreceived the $1,000. That’s your opportunity cost. That’s what it costs you to not have \\nliquidity. Since \\nPV× (1+r) t =FV, then PV=FV/[ (1+r) t ], so PV=1,000/( 1.04 1 )=961.5385.  \\nYour gift is worth $961.5385 today (its present value). If your grandparents offered to \\ngive you your twenty-first birthday gift on your twentieth birthday, they could give you \\n$961.5385 today, which would be the equivalent value to you of getting $1,000 one year \\nfrom now. \\nIt is important to understand the relationships between time, risk, opportunity cost, and \\nvalue. This equation describes that relationship: \\n'),\n",

Discuss the importance of the idea of the time value of money in financial decisions. \\n2. Define the present value of a series of cash flows. \\n3. Define an annuity. \\n4. Identify the factors you need to know to calculate the value of an annuity.  \\n5. Discuss the relationships of those factors to the annuity’s value. \\n6. Define a perpetuity. \\nIt is quite common in finance to value a series of future cash flows (CF), perhaps a series \\nof withdrawals from a retirement account, interest payments from a bond, or deposits \\nfor a savings account. The present value (PV) of the series of cash flows is equal to the \\nsum of the present value of each cash flow, so valuation is straightforward: find the \\npresent value of each cash flow and then add them up. \\nOften, the series of cash flows is such that each cash flow has the same future value. \\nWhen there are regular payments at regular intervals and each payment is the same \\namount, that series of cash flows is an annuity. Most consumer loan repayments are \\nannuities, as are, typically, installment purchases, mortgages, retirement investments, \\nsavings plans, and retirement plan payouts. Fixed-rate bond interest payments are an \\nannuity, as are stable stock dividends over long periods of time. You could think of your '),\n",

To \\nmake the annual payment more attractive for you— it isn’t, because you would want to \\nhave more liquidity sooner— the lump-sum option is discounted to reflect the present \\nvalue of the payment annuity. The discount rate, which determines that present value, is \\nchosen at the discretion of the lottery agency. \\nSay you win $10 million. The lottery agency offers you a choice: take $500,000 per year \\nover 20 years or take a one-time lump-sum payout of $6,700,000. You would choose \\nthe alternative with the greatest value. The present value of the lump-sum payout is \\n$6,700,000. The value of the annuity is not simply $10 million, or $500,000 × 20, \\nbecause those $500,000 payments are received over time and time affects liquidity and \\nthus value. So the question is, What is the annuity worth to you? \\nYour discount rate or opportunity cost will determine the annuity’s value to you, as \\nFigure 4.8 \"Lottery Present Value with Different Discount Rates\" shows. \\nFigure 4.8 Lottery Present Value with Different Discount Rates '),\n",

The annuity would be worth the same to \\nyou as the lump-sum payout if your discount rate were 4.16 percent. \\nIn other words, if your discount rate is about 4 percent or less— if you don’t have more \\nlucrative choices than earning 4 percent with that liquidity— then the annuity is worth \\nmore to you than the immediate payout. You can afford to wait for that liquidity and \\ncollect it over twenty years because you have no better choice. On the other hand, if your \\ndiscount rate is higher than 4 percent, or if you feel that your use of that liquidity would \\nearn you more than 4 percent, then you have more lucrative things to do with that \\nmoney and you want it now: the annuity is worth less to you than the payout. \\nFor an annuity, as when relating one cash flow’s present and future value, the greater \\nthe rate at which time affects value, the greater the effect on the present value. When \\nopportunity cost or risk is low, waiting for liquidity doesn’t matter as much as when \\nopportunity costs or risks are higher. When opportunity costs are low, you have nothing \\nbetter to do with your liquidity, but when opportunity costs are higher, you may sacrifice \\nmore by having no liquidity. Liquidity is valuable because it allows you to make choices. \\nAfter all, if there are no more valuable choices to make, you lose little by giving up \\nliquidity. The higher the rate at which time affects value, the more it costs to wait for \\nliquidity, and the more choices pass you by while you wait for liquidity. \\nWhen risk is low, it is not really important to have your liquidity firmly in hand any \\nsooner because you’ll have it sooner or later anyhow. But when risk is high, getting \\nliquidity sooner becomes more important because it lessens the chance of not getting it \\nat all. The higher the rate at which time affects value, the more risk there is in waiting \\nfor liquidity and the more chance that you won’t get it at all. \\nAs r increases the PV of the annuity decreases \\nAs r decreases the PV of the annuity increases \\n'),\n",

Say you decide to take the $500,000 annual lottery \\npayout for twenty years. If you deposit that payout in a bank account earning 4 percent, \\nhow much would you have in twenty years?

It is hard to imagine a stream of cash flows that never ends, \\nbut it is actually not so rare as it sounds. The dividends from a share of corporate stock \\nare a perpetuity, because in theory, a corporation has an infinite life (as a separate legal \\nentity from its shareholders or owners) and because, for many reasons, corporations like \\nto maintain a steady dividend for their shareholders. \\nThe perpetuity represents the maximum value of the annuity, or the value of the annuity \\nwith the most cash flows and therefore the most liquidity and therefore the most value. \\nLife Is a Series of Cash Flows \\nOnce you understand the idea of the time value of money, and of its use for valuing a \\nseries of cash flows and of annuities in particular, you can’t believe how you ever got \\nthrough life without it. These are the fundamental relationships that structure so many \\nfinancial decisions, most of which involve a series of cash inflows or outflows. \\nUnderstanding these relationships can be a tool to help you answer some of the most \\ncommon financial questions about buying and selling liquidity, because loans and \\ninvestments are so often structured as annuities and certainly take place over time. \\nLoans are usually designed as annuities, with regular periodic payments that include \\ninterest expense and principal repayment. Using these relationships, you can see the \\neffect of a different amount borrowed (PVannuity), interest rate (r), or term of the loan (t) \\non the periodic payment (CF). \\nFor example, if you get a $250,000 (PV), thirty-year (t), 6.5 percent (r) mortgage, the \\nmonthly payment will be $1,577 (CF). If the same mortgage had an interest rate of only \\n5.5 percent (r), your monthly payment would decrease to $1,423 (CF). If it were a \\nfifteen-year (t) mortgage, still at 6.5 percent (r), the monthly payment would be $2,175 \\n(CF). If you can make a larger down payment and borrow less, say $200,000 (PV), then \\nwith a thirty-year (t), 6.5 percent (r) mortgage you monthly payment would be only \\n$1,262 (CF) (Figure 4.11 \"Mortgage Calculations\"). \\nFigure 4.11 Mortgage Calculations \\n \\nNote that in Figure 4.11 \"Mortgage Calculations\", the mortgage rate is the monthly rate, \\nthat is, the annual rate divided by twelve (months in the year) or r ÷ 12, and that t is \\nstated as the number of months, or the number of years × 12 (months in the year).

In this example, because \\nyou have monthly cash flows, you must calculate using the monthly discount rate (r) and \\nthe number of months (t). \\nSaving to reach a goal— to provide a down payment on a house, or a child’s education, or \\nretirement income— is often accomplished by a plan of regular deposits to an account for \\nthat purpose. The savings plan is an annuity, so these relationships can be used to \\ncalculate how much would have to be saved each period to reach the goal (CF), or given \\nhow much can be saved each period, how long it will take to reach the goal (t), or how a \\nbetter investment return (r) would affect the periodic savings, or the time needed (t), or \\nthe goal (FV). \\nFor example, if you want to have $1,000,000 (FV) in the bank when you retire, and your \\nbank pays 3 percent (r) interest per year, and you can save $10,000 per year (CF) \\ntoward retirement, can you afford to retire at age sixty-five?

Alice can actually project how her \\nfinancial statements will look after each choice is followed. \\nWhen making financial decisions, it is helpful to be able to think in terms of their \\nconsequences on the financial statements, which provide an order to our summary of \\nfinancial results. For example, in previous chapters, Alice was deciding how to decrease \\nher debt. Her choices were to continue to pay it down gradually as she does now; to get a \\nsecond job to pay it off faster; or to go to Vegas, hit it big (or lose big), and eliminate her \\ndebt altogether (or wind up with even more).

That depends on how she \\nproceeds, but the pro forma balance sheets (Figure 4.17 \"Alice’s Pro Forma Balance \\nSheets\") can give a glimpse. \\nFigure 4.17 Alice’s Pro Forma Balance Sheets \\n \\nIf Alice has a second job, her net worth increases but is still negative, as she has paid \\ndown more of her student loan than she otherwise would have, but it is still larger than \\nher asset value. If she wins in Vegas, her net worth can be positive; with her loan paid off \\nentirely, her asset value will equal her net worth. However, if she loses in Vegas, she will \\nhave to borrow more, her new debt quadrupling her liabilities and decreasing her net \\nworth by that much more. \\nA summary of the critical “bottom lines” from each pro forma statement (Figure 4.18 \\n\"Alice’s Pro Forma Bottom Lines\") most clearly shows Alice’s complete picture for each \\nalternative. \\nFigure 4.18 Alice’s Pro Forma Bottom Lines \\n \\n'),\n",

While the outcomes for continuing or getting a second job are fairly \\ncertain, the outcome in Vegas is not; there are two possible outcomes in Vegas. The \\nVegas choice has the most risk or the least certainty. \\nThe Vegas alternative also has strategic costs: if she loses, her increased debt and its \\nobligations— more interest and principal payments on more debt— will further delay her \\ngoal of building an asset base from which to generate new sources of income. In the near \\nfuture, or until her new debt is repaid, she will have even fewer financial choices. \\nThe strategic benefit of the Vegas alternative is that if she wins, she can eliminate debt, \\nbegin to build her asset base, and have even more choices (by eliminating debt and \\nfreeing cash flow). \\nThe next step for Alice would be to try to assess the probabilities of winning or of losing \\nin Vegas. Once she has determined the risk involved— given the consequences now \\nilluminated on the pro forma financial statements— she would have to decide if she can \\ntolerate that risk, or if she should reject that alternative because of its risk. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\nPro forma financial statements show the consequences of financial choices in the context of the \\nfinancial statements. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

One of the most important to understand is the idea of \\nindependence. \\nAn independent event is one that happens by chance. It cannot be willed or decided \\nupon. The probability or likelihood of an independent event can be measured, based on \\nits frequency in the past, and that probability can be used to predict whether it will \\nrecur. Independent events can be the result of complex situations. They can be studied \\nto see which confluence of circumstances or conditions make them more or less likely or \\naffect their probability. But an independent event is, in the end, no matter how skillfully \\nanalyzed, a matter of some chance or uncertainty or risk; it cannot be determined or \\nchosen. \\nAlice can choose whether or not to go to Vegas, but she cannot choose whether or not to \\nwin. Winning— or losing— is an independent event. She can predict her chances, the \\nprobability, that she’ll win based on her past experiences, her apparent skill and \\nknowledge, and the known odds of casino gambling (about which many studies have \\nbeen done and there is much knowledge available). But she cannot choose to win; there \\nis always some uncertainty or risk that she will not. \\nThe probability of any one outcome for an event is always stated as a percentage of the \\ntotal outcomes possible. An independent or risky event has at least two possible \\noutcomes: it happens or it does not happen. There may be more outcomes possible, but \\nthere are at least two; if there were only one outcome possible, there would be no \\nuncertainty or risk about the outcome. \\nFor example, you have a “50-50 chance” of “heads” when you flip a coin, or a 50 percent \\nprobability. On average “heads” comes up half the time. That probability is based on \\nhistoric frequency; that is, “on average” means that for all the times that coins have been \\nflipped, half the time “heads” is the result. There are only two possible outcomes when \\nyou flip a coin, and there is a 50 percent chance of each. The probabilities of each \\npossible outcome add up to 100 percent, because there is 100 percent probability that \\nsomething will happen. In this case, half the time it is one result, and half the time it is \\nthe other. In general, the probabilities of each possible outcome— and there may be \\nmany— add to 100 percent. \\nProbabilities can be used in financial decisions to measure the expected result of an \\nindependent event. That expectation is based on the probabilities of each outcome and \\nits result if it does occur. Suppose you have a little wager going on the coin flip; you will \\nwin a dollar if it come up “heads” and you will lose a dollar if it does not (“tails”). You \\nhave a 50 percent chance of $1.00 and a 50 percent chance of −$1.00. Half the time you \\ncan expect to gain a dollar, and half the time you can expect to lose a dollar. Your \\nexpectation of the average result, based on the historic frequency or probability of each \\noutcome and its actual result, is \\n(0.50×1.00)+(0.50×−1.00)=0.50+−0.50=0, or ( probability heads × result heads )+( \\nprobability tails × result tails )  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  103 \\n— note that the probabilityheads + the probabilitytails = 1 or 100%— because those are all \\nthe possible outcomes. The expected result for each outcome is its probability or \\nlikelihood multiplied by its result. The expected result or expected value for the \\naction, for flipping a coin, is its weighted average outcome, with the “weights” being the \\nprobabilities of each of its outcomes. \\nIf you get $1.00 every time the coin flips “heads” and it does so half the time, then half \\nthe time you get a dollar, or you can expect overall to realize half a dollar or $0.50 from \\nflipping “heads.” The other half of the time, you can expect to lose a dollar, so your \\nexpectation has to include the possibility of flipping “tails” with an overall or average \\nresult of losing $0.50 or −$0.50. So you can expect 0.50 from one outcome and −0.50 \\nfrom the other: altogether, you can expect 0.50 + −0.50 or 0 (which is why “flipping \\ncoins” is not a popular casino game.) \\nThe expected value (E(V)) of an event is the sum of each possible outcome’s probability \\nmultiplied by its result, or \\nE(V)=Σ( p n × r n ),  \\nwhere Σ means summation, p is the probability of an outcome, r is its result, and n is the \\nnumber of outcomes possible. \\nWhen faced with the uncertainty of an alternative that involves an independent event, it \\nis often quite helpful to be able to at least calculate its expected value. Then, when \\nmaking a decision, that expectation can be weighed against or compared to those of \\nother choices. \\nFor example, Alice has projected four possible outcomes for her finances depending on \\nwhether she continues, gets a second job, wins in Vegas, or loses in Vegas, but there are \\nreally only three choices: continue, second job, or go to Vegas— since winning or losing \\nare outcomes of the one decision to go to Vegas. She knows, with little or no uncertainty, \\nhow her financial situation will look if she continues or gets a second job. To compare \\nthe Vegas choice with the other two, she needs to predict what she can expect from \\ngoing to Vegas, given that she may win or lose once there. \\nAlice can calculate the expected result of going to Vegas if she knows the probabilities of \\nits two outcomes, winning and losing. Alice does a bit of research and has a friend show \\nher a few tricks and decides that for her the probability of winning is 30 percent, which \\nmakes the probability of losing 70 percent. (As there are only two possible outcomes in \\nthis case, their probabilities must add to 100 percent.) Her expected result in Vegas, \\nthen, is \\n(0.30×100,000)+(0.70×−100,000)=30,000+−70,000=−40,000.  \\nUsing the same calculations, she can project the expected result of going to Vegas on her \\npro forma financial statements (Figure 4.21 \"Alice’s Expected Outcomes with a 30 \\nPercent Chance of Winning in Vegas\"). Look at the effect on her bottom lines: '),\n",

Her net cash flow (CF) \\nactually seems best with the Vegas option, but that assumes she can borrow to pay her \\ngambling losses, so her losses don’t create net negative cash flow. She does, however, \\ncreate debt. \\nAlice can also calculate what the probability of winning would have to be to make it a \\nworthwhile choice at all, that is, to give her at least as good a result as either of her other \\nchoices (Figure 4.22 \"Alice’s Expected Outcomes to Make Vegas a Competitive Choice\"). \\nFigure 4.22 Alice’s Expected Outcomes to Make Vegas a Competitive Choice \\n \\nTo be the best choice in terms of all three bottom lines, Alice would have to have a 78 \\npercent chance of winning at Vegas. \\nHer net worth would still be negative, but all three bottom lines would be at least as \\ngood or better than they would be with her other two choices. If Alice thought she had at \\nleast a 78 percent chance of winning and could tolerate the risk that she might not, \\nVegas would be a viable choice for her. \\nThose are two very big “ifs,” but by being able to project an expected value or result for \\neach of her choices, using the probabilities of each outcome for the choice with \\nuncertainty, Alice can at least measure and compare the choices. \\nUsing probabilities to derive the expected value of a choice provides a way to evaluate an \\nalternative with uncertainty.

People often resolve to somehow improve themselves or their lives. But while they \\nare not lacking sincerity, determination, or effort, they nevertheless fall short for want of \\na plan, a map, a picture of why and how to get from here to there. \\nPro forma financial statements provide a look at the potential results of financial \\ndecisions. They can also be used as a tool to plan for certain results. When projected in \\nthe form of a budgetA projection of the financial requirements and consequences of a \\nplan., figures become not only an estimated result but also an actual strategy or plan, a \\nmap illustrating a path to achieve a goal. Later, when you compare actual results to the \\noriginal plan, you can see how shortfalls or successes can point to future strategies. \\nBudgets are usually created with a specific goal in mind: to cut living expenses, to \\nincrease savings, or to save for a specific purpose such as education or retirement. While \\nthe need to do such things may be brought into sharper focus by the financial \\nstatements, the budget provides an actual plan for doing so. It is more a document of \\naction than of reflection. \\nAs an action statement, a budget is meant to be dynamic, a reconciliation of “facts on the \\nground” and “castles in the air.” While financial statements are summaries of historic \\nreality, that is, of all that has already happened and is “sunk,” budgets reflect the current \\nrealities that define the next choices. A budget should never be merely followed but \\nshould constantly be revised to reflect new information. \\n5.1 The Budget Process \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Trace the budget process. \\n2. Discuss the relationships of goals and behaviors. \\n3. Demonstrate the importance of conservatism in the budget process. \\n4. Show the importance of timing in the budget process. \\nThe budget process is an infinite loop similar to the larger financial planning process. It \\ninvolves \\n• defining goals and gathering data; \\n• forming expectations and reconciling goals and data; \\n• creating the budget; '),\n",

It may also point out new choices. For example, an immediate goal \\nmay be to lower housing expense. In the short-term you could look for an apartment \\nwith lower rent, but in the long run, it may be more advantageous to own a home. This \\nlong-term goal may indicate a need to start a savings plan for a down payment. \\nThe process of creating a budget can be instructive. Creating a budget involves \\nprojecting realistic behavior. Your assumptions may come from your actual past \\nbehavior based on accurate records that you have gathered. If you have been using \\npersonal finance software, it has been keeping those records for you; if not, a thorough \\nreview of your checkbook and investment statements will reveal that information. \\nFinancial statements are useful summaries of the information you need to create a \\nbudget. \\nAfter formulating realistic expectations based on past behavior and current \\ncircumstances, you still must reconcile your future behavior with your original \\nexpectations. For example, you may recognize that greater sacrifices need to be made, or \\nthat you must change your behavior, or even that your goals are unattainable and should \\nbe more realistic— perhaps based on less desirable choices. On the other hand, this can \\nbe a process of happy discovery: goals may be closer or require less sacrifice than you \\nmay have thought. \\nWhether it results in sobering dismay or ambitious joy, the budget process is one of \\nreconciling your financial realities to your financial dreams. How you finance your life \\ndetermines how you can live your life, so budgeting is really a process of mapping out a \\n'),\n",

You may find it difficult to separate the emotional and financial aspects of \\nyour goals, but the more successfully you can do so, the more successfully you will reach \\nyour goals. \\nA budget is a projection of how things should work out, but there is always some \\nuncertainty. If the actual results are better than expected, if incomes are more or \\nexpenses less, expectations can be adjusted upward as a welcome accommodation to \\ngood fortune. On the other hand, if actual results are worse than expected, if incomes \\nare less or expenses more, not only the next budget but also current living choices may \\nhave to be adjusted to accommodate that situation. Those new choices are less than \\npreferred or you would have chosen them in your original plan. \\nTo avoid unwelcome adjustments, you should be conservative in your expectations so \\nas to maximize the probability that your actual results will be better than expected. \\nThus, when estimating, you would always underestimate the income items and potential \\ngains and overestimate the expense items and potential losses. \\nYou will also need to determine a time period and frequency for your budget process: \\nannually, monthly, or weekly. The timing will depend on how much financial activity \\nyou have and how much discipline or guidance you want your budget to provide. You \\nshould assess your progress at least annually. In general, you want to keep a manageable \\namount of data for any one period, so the more financial activity you have, the shorter \\nyour budget period should be. Since your budget needs to be monitored consistently, \\nyou don’t want to be flooded with so much data that monitoring becomes too daunting a \\ntask. On the other hand, you want to choose an ample period or time frame to show \\nmeaningful results. Choose a time period that makes sense for your quantity of data or \\nlevel of financial activity. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• A budget is a process that mirrors the financial planning process.  \\n• The process of creating a budget can suggest goals, behaviors, and limitations.  \\n• For the budget to succeed, goals and behaviors must be reconciled. \\n• Budgets should be prepared conservatively: \\no Overestimate costs. \\no Underestimate earnings. \\n• The appropriate time period is one that is \\no short enough to limit the amount of data, \\no long enough to capture meaningful data. \\nEXERCISES  '),\n",

Describe the components of the comprehensive budget and their purposes.  \\n2. Describe the components of an operating budget. \\n3. Discuss the sources of recurring income and expenses. \\n4. Identify the factors in the operating budgeting process. \\n5. Identify the factors in the capital budgeting process. \\nGathering data and creating a budget— with some goals already in mind— are the initial \\nsteps in the process. Understanding the format or shape of the budget will help guide \\nyou to the kind of information you need. A comprehensive budget— that is, a budget \\ncovering all aspects of financial life— will include a projection of recurring incomes and \\nexpenses and of nonrecurring expenditures. (Nonrecurring income or “windfalls” should \\nnot be counted on or “budgeted for,” conservatively.) Recurring incomes would be \\nearnings from wages, interest, or dividends. Recurring expenditures may include living \\nexpenses, loan repayments, and regular savings or investment deposits. Nonrecurring \\nexpenditures may be for capital improvements such as a new roof for your house or for \\npurchases of durable items such as a refrigerator or a car. These are purchases that \\nwould not be made each period. A comprehensive budget diagram is shown in Figure \\n5.4 \"Comprehensive Budget Diagram\". \\nFigure 5.4 Comprehensive Budget Diagram '),\n",

Recurring items need to be taken care of repeatedly and are therefore \\nconsidered in the short term, while the items on the capital budget may allow for long-\\nterm planning because they happen less frequently. The different time horizons for \\nplanning for recurring and nonrecurring items may allow for different strategies to \\nreach those different goals. \\nA comprehensive budget is a compilation of an operating budget for short-term goals \\ninvolving recurring items and a capital budget for long-term goals involving \\nnonrecurring items. \\nOperating Budget: Recurring Incomes and \\nExpenditures \\nUsing Financial History \\nRecurring incomes and expenditures are usually the easiest to determine and project, as \\nthey happen consistently and have an immediate effect on your everyday living. An \\nincome statement shows incomes and expenses; cash flow statements show actual cash \\nexpenditures. Recurring incomes and expenditures are planned in the context of short-\\nterm lifestyle goals or preferences. \\nLook at a time period large enough to capture relevant data. Some incomes and \\nexpenditures recur reliably but only periodically or seasonally. For example, you may \\npay the premium on your auto insurance policy twice per year. It is a recurring expense, \\nbut it happens in only two months of the year, so you would have to look at expenditures \\nover enough months to see it. Or your heating or cooling expenses may change \\nseasonally, affecting your utility expenses in some months more than in others. \\nThe time period you choose for a budget should be long enough to show intermittent \\nitems as recurring and nonrecurring items as unusual, yet small enough to follow and to \\nmanage choices within the period. For personal budgets, a month is the most common \\nbudget period to use, since most living expenses are paid at least monthly. However, it is \\nbest to use at least one full year’s worth of data to get a reasonable monthly average and \\nto see seasonal and periodic items as they occur. \\n'),\n",

Taking a conservative approach, you should include the maximum possible \\namount of uncertain expenses in your budget. If income occurs regularly but the amount \\nis uncertain, conservatively include the minimum amount. If income actually happens \\nirregularly, it may be better just to leave it out of your budget—and your plans— since \\nyou can’t “count” on it. \\nConsider the following example: Mark works as a school counselor, tutors on the side, \\ndoes house painting in the summer, and buys and sells sports memorabilia on the \\nInternet. In 2006, he bought an older house with a $200,000, fixed-rate mortgage at \\n5.75 percent. Every year, he deposits $1,000 into his retirement account and uses some \\ncapital for home improvements. He used a car loan to buy his car. Whatever cash is left \\nover after he has paid his bills is saved in a money market account that earns 3 percent \\ninterest. At the end of 2009, Mark is trying to draw up a budget for 2010. Since he \\nbought the house, he has been keeping pretty good financial records, shown in Figure \\n5.5 \"Mark’s Financial Data, 2006–2009\". \\nMark has five sources of income— some more constant, some more reliable, and some \\nmore seasonal. His counseling job provides a steady, year-round paycheck. House \\npainting is a seasonal although fairly reliable source of income; in 2008 it was less \\nbecause Mark fell from a ladder and was unable to paint for two months. Tutoring is a \\nseasonal source of income, and since the school hired an additional counselor in 2008, \\nit has decreased. Memorabilia trading is a year-round but unpredictable source of \\nincome. In 2009 he made some very lucrative trades, but in 2007 almost none. Interest \\nincome depends on the balance in the money market account. He would include his \\ncounseling, painting, and interest incomes in his budget, but should be conservative \\nabout including his tutoring or trading incomes. \\nMark’s expenses are reliable and easily predictable, with a few exceptions. His accident \\nin 2008 increased his medical expenses for that year. Both gas for the car and heating \\nexpense vary with the weather and the highly volatile price of oil; in 2008 those \\nexpenses were unusually high. Property tax increased in 2009 but is unlikely to do so \\nagain for several years. \\nFigure 5.5 Mark’s Financial Data, 2006–2009 '),\n",

As with any forecast, the more \\ninformation you can include in your projections, the more accurate it is likely to be. \\nMark knows that the hiring of a new counselor has significantly cut into his tutoring \\nincome and will likely continue to do so. He will get a modest raise in his wages, but has \\nbeen notified that the co-pays and deductibles on his medical and dental insurance will \\nincrease in 2010. He has just traded in his car and gotten a new loan for a “new” used \\ncar. \\nThe personal or micro characteristics of your situation influence your expectations, \\nespecially if they are expected to change. Personal factors such as family structure, \\nhealth, career choice, and age have significant influence on financial choices and goals. \\nIf any of those factors is expected to change, your financial situation should be expected \\nto change as well, and that expectation should be included in your budget projections. \\nFor example, if you are expecting to increase or decrease the size of your family or \\nhousehold, that would affect your consumption of goods and services. If you anticipate a \\nchange of job or of career, that will affect your income from wages. A change in health \\nmay result in working more or less and thus changing income from wages. There are \\nmany ways that personal circumstances can change, and they can change your financial \\nexpectations, choices, and goals. All these projected changes need to be included in the \\nbudget process. \\nUsing Economics and “Macro” Factors \\nMacro factors affecting your budget come from the context of the wider economy, so \\nunderstanding how incomes and expenses are created is useful in forming estimates. \\nIncomes are created when labor or capital (liquidity or assets) is sold. The amount of \\nincome created depends on the quantity sold and on the price. \\nThe price of labor depends on the relative supply and demand for labor reflected in \\nunemployment rates. The price of liquidity depends on the relative supply and demand \\nfor capital reflected in interest rates. Unemployment rates and interest rates in turn \\ndepend on the complex, dynamic economy. \\nThe economy tends to behave cyclically. If the economy is in a period of contraction or \\nrecession, demand for labor is lower, competition among workers is higher, and wages \\ncannot be expected to rise. As unemployment rises, especially if you are working in an \\nindustry that is cyclically contracting with the economy, wages may become unreliable \\nor increasingly risky if there is risk of losing your job. Interest rates are, as a rule, more \\nvolatile and thus more difficult to predict, but generally tend to fall during a period of \\ncontraction and rise in a period of expansion. A budget period is usually short so that '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  114 \\neconomic factors will not vary widely enough to affect projections over that brief period. \\nStill, those economic factors should inform your estimates of potential income. \\nExpenses are created when a quantity of goods or services is consumed for a price. That \\nprice depends on the relative supply of and demand for those goods and services and \\nalso on the larger context of price levels in the economy. If inflation or deflation is \\ndecreasing or increasing the value of our currency, then its purchasing power is \\nchanging and so is the real cost of expenses. Again, as a rule, the budget period should \\nbe short enough so that changes in purchasing power won’t affect the budget too much; \\nstill, these changes should not be ignored. Price levels are much quicker to change than \\nwage levels, so it is quite possible to have a rise in prices before a rise in wages, which \\ndecreases the real purchasing power of your paycheck. \\nIf you have a variable rate loan— that is, a loan for which the interest rate may be \\nadjusted periodically— you are susceptible to interest rate volatility. (This is discussed at \\nlength in Chapter 16 \"Owning Bonds\".) You should be aware of that particular macro \\nfactor when creating your budget. \\nMacroeconomic factors are difficult to predict, as they reflect complex scenarios, but \\nnews about current and expected economic conditions is easily available in the media \\nevery day. A good financial planner will also be keeping a sharp eye on economic \\nindicators and forecasts.

He used the minimum income from the past four years for \\nmemorabilia sales, which is conservative and reasonable given its volatility. His painting \\nincome is less volatile, so his estimate is an average, excluding the unusual year of his \\naccident. Interest income is based on his current money market account balance, which \\nis adjusted for an expected drop in interest rates. \\nMark expects his expenses to be what they were in 2009, since his costs and \\nconsumption are not expected to change. However, he has adjusted his medical and \\ndental insurance and his car lease payments on the basis of his new knowledge. \\nThe price of gas and heating oil has been extraordinarily volatile during this period \\n(2006–2009), affecting Mark’s gas and heating expense, so he bases his estimates on \\nwhat he knows about his expected consumption and the price. He knows he drives an \\naverage of about 15,000 miles per year and that his car gets about 20 miles per gallon. \\nHe estimates his gas expense for 2010 by guessing that since oil price levels are about \\nwhere they were in 2007, gas will cost, on average, what it did then, which was $2.50 \\nper gallon. He will buy, on average, 750 gallons per year (15,000 miles ÷ 20 mpg), so his \\ntotal expense will be $1,875. Mark also knows that he uses 500 gallons of heating oil \\neach year. Estimating heating oil prices at 2007 levels, his cost will be about the same as \\nit was then, or $1,200. \\nMark knows that the more knowledge and information he can bring to bear, the more \\naccurate and useful his estimates are likely to be. \\nFigure 5.8 Mark’s 2010 Budget '),\n",

Capital \\nexpenditures are usually part of a long-term plan of building an asset base. Investment \\nmay also be part of a longer-term plan to build an asset base or to achieve a specific goal \\nsuch as financing education or retirement. \\nLong-term strategies are based on expected changes to the micro factors that shape \\ngoals. For example, you want to save for retirement because you anticipate aging and \\nnot being as willing or able to sell labor. Expanding or shrinking the family structure \\nmay create new savings goals or a change in housing needs that will indicate a change in \\nasset base (e.g., buying or selling a house). \\nSome changes will eliminate a specific goal. A child finishing college, for example, ends \\nthe need for education savings. Some changes will emphasize the necessity of a goal, \\nsuch as a decline in health underscoring the need to save for retirement. As personal \\nfactors change, you should reassess your longer-term goals and the capital expenditure \\ntoward those goals because long-term goals and thus capital expenditures may change \\nwith them. \\nWhile many personal factors are relatively predictable over the long-term (e.g., you will \\nget older, not younger), the macroeconomic factors that will occur simultaneously are \\nmuch harder to predict. Will the economy be expanding or contracting when you retire? \\nWill there be inflation or deflation? The further (in time) you are from your goals, the \\nharder it is to predict those factors and the less relevant they are to your budgeting \\nconcerns. As you get closer to your goals, macro factors become more influential in the \\nassessment of your goals and your progress toward them. \\nSince long-term strategies happen over time, you should use the relationships between \\ntime and value to calculate capital expenditures and progress toward long-term goals. \\nLong-term goals are often best reached by a progression of steady and even steps; for \\nexample, a saving goal is often reached by a series of regular and steady deposits. Those \\nregular deposits form an annuity. Knowing how much time there is and how much \\ncompounding there can be to turn your account balance (the present value of this \\nannuity) into your savings goal (its future value), you can calculate the amount of the \\ndeposits into the account. This can then be compared to your projected free cash flow to \\nsee if such a deposit is possible. You can also see if your goal is too modest or too \\nambitious and should be adjusted in terms of the time to reach a goal or the rate at \\nwhich you do. \\nCapital expenditures may be a one-time investment, like a new roof. A capital \\nexpenditure may also be a step toward a long-term goal, like an annual savings deposit. \\nThat goal should be assessed with each budget, and that “step” or capital expenditure \\nshould be reviewed.

Although cash flows may be adequate to support expenses for the whole \\nyear, there may be timing differences. Cash flows from income may be less frequent \\nthan cash flows for expenses, for example, or may be seasonal while expenses are more '),\n",

Most expenses must be paid on a monthly basis, and if some income cash flows \\noccur less frequently or only seasonally, there is a risk of running out of cash in a \\nspecific month. For cash flows, timing is everything. \\nA good management tool is the cash budget, which is a rearrangement of budget items \\nto show each month in detail. Irregular cash flows can be placed in the specific months \\nwhen they will occur, allowing you to see the effects of cash flow timing more clearly. \\nMark’s cash budget for 2010 is in the spreadsheet shown in Figure 5.11 \"Mark’s Cash \\nBudget\". \\nFigure 5.11 Mark’s Cash Budget \\n \\nMark’s original annual budget (Figure 5.8 \"Mark’s 2010 Budget\") shows that although \\nhis income is enough to cover his living expenses, it does not produce enough cash to \\n'),\n",

In fact, his cash flow would \\nfall short by about $6,870, even after he uses the cash from his savings (the money \\nmarket account). If he must make the capital expenditure this year, he can finance it \\nwith a line of credit: a loan where money can be borrowed as needed, up to a limit, \\nand paid down as desired, and interest is paid only on the outstanding balance. Using \\nthe line of credit, Mark would create an extra $321 of interest expense for the year. \\nThe cash budget (Figure 5.11 \"Mark’s Cash Budget\") shows a more detailed and slightly \\ndifferent story. Because of Mark’s seasonal incomes, if he has the roof fixed in May, he \\nwill need to borrow $10,525 in May (before he has income from painting). Then he can \\npay that balance down until October, when he will need to extend it again to pay his \\nproperty tax. By the end of the year, his outstanding debt will be a bit more than \\noriginally shown, with an ending balance of $6,887. But his total interest expense will be \\na bit less— only $221— as the loan balance (and therefore the interest expense) will be \\nless in some of the months that he has the loan. \\nThe cash (monthly) budget shows a different story than the annual budget because of \\nthe seasonal nature of Mark’s incomes. Since he is planning the capital expenditures \\nbefore he begins to earn income from painting, he actually has to borrow more— and \\nassume more risk— than originally indicated. \\nThe cash budget may show risks but also remedies that otherwise may not be apparent. \\nIn Mark’s case, it is clear that the capital expenditure cannot be financed without some \\nexternal source of capital, most likely a line of credit. He would have to pay interest on \\nthat loan, creating an additional expense. That expense would be in proportion to the \\namount borrowed and the time it is borrowed for. In his original plan the capital \\nexpenditure occurred in May, and Mark would have had to borrow about $10,525, \\npaying interest for the next seven months of the year. Delaying the capital expenditure \\nuntil October, however, would cost him less, because he would have to borrow less and \\nwould be paying interest in fewer months. An alternative cash budget illustrating this \\nscenario is shown in Figure 5.12 \"Mark’s Alternative Cash Budget\". \\nFigure 5.12 Mark’s Alternative Cash Budget '),\n",

He could borrow less, \\nending the year about $6,557 short, and his interest expense would be only $123, \\nbecause he has borrowed less and because he can wait until October to borrow, thus \\npaying interest for only three months of the year. \\nTiming matters for cash flows because you need to get cash before you spend it, but also \\nbecause time affects value, so it is always better to have liquidity sooner and hang onto it \\nlonger. A cash budget provides a much more detailed look at these timing issues, and \\nthe risks— and opportunities— of cash management that you may otherwise have missed. \\nOther Specialized Budgets \\nA cash flow budget is a budget that projects a specific aspect of your finances, that is, the \\ncash flows.

A specialized budget is ultimately included in the comprehensive budget, \\nas it is a part of total financial activity. It usually reflects one particular activity in more \\ndetail, such as the effect of owning and maintaining a particular asset or of pursuing a \\nparticular activity. You create a budget for that asset or that activity by segregating its \\nincomes and expenses from your comprehensive budget. It is possible to create such a \\nfocused budget only if you can identify and separate its financial activity from the rest of \\nyour financial life. If so, you may want to track an activity separately that is directly \\nrelated to a specific goal. \\nFor example, suppose you decide to take up weekend backpacking as a recreational \\nactivity. You are going to try it for two years, and then decide if you want to continue. \\nAside from assessing the enjoyment that it gives you, you want to be able to assess its \\nimpact on your finances. Typically, weekend backpacking requires specialized \\nequipment and clothing, travel to a hiking trail access or campground, and perhaps \\nlodging and meals: capital investment (in the equipment) and then recurring expenses. \\nYou may want to create a separate budget for your backpacking investment and \\nexpenses in order to assess the value of this new recreational activity. \\nOne common type of specialized budget is a tax budget, including activities— incomes, \\nexpenses, gains, and losses— that have direct tax consequences. A tax budget can be \\nuseful in planning for or anticipating an event that will have significant tax \\nconsequences— for example, income from self-employment; the sale of a long-term asset \\nsuch as a stock portfolio, business, or real estate; or a gift of significant wealth or the \\nsettling of an estate. \\nWhile it can be valuable to isolate and identify the effects of a specific activity or the \\nprogress toward a specific goal, that activity or that goal is ultimately just a part of your \\nlarger financial picture. Specialized budgets need to remain a part of your \\ncomprehensive financial planning. \\nKEY TAK EAWAYS  \\n• The cash flow budget is an alternative format used as a cash management tool that provides  \\no more detailed information about the timing and amounts of cash flows,  \\no a clearer view of risks and opportunities. \\n• Specialized budgets focus on a specific asset or activity. \\n• A tax budget is commonly used to track taxable activities. \\n• Eventually, specialized budgets need to be included in the comprehensive budget to have a \\ncomplete perspective. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Identify the importance of budget-monitoring activities. \\n3. Analyze budget variances to understand their causes, including possible changes in micro or \\nmacro factors. \\n4. Analyze budget variances to see potential remedies and to gauge their feasibility.  \\nA budget variance occurs when the actual results of your financial activity differ from \\nyour budgeted projections. Since your expectations were based on knowledge from your \\nfinancial history, micro- and macroeconomic factors, and new information, if there is a \\nvariance, it is because your estimate was inaccurate or because one or more of those \\nfactors changed unexpectedly. If your estimate was inaccurate— perhaps you had \\noverlooked or ignored a factor— knowing that can help you improve. If one or more of \\nthose factors has changed unexpectedly, then identifying the cause of the variance \\ncreates new information with which to better assess your situation. At the very least, \\nvariances will alert you to the need for adjustments to your budget and to the \\nappropriate choices. \\nOnce you have created a budget, your financial life continues. As actual data replace \\nprojections, you must monitor the budget compared to your actual activities so that you \\nwill notice any serious variances or deviations from the expected outcomes detailed in \\nthe budget. Your analysis and understanding of variances constitute new information \\nfor adjusting your current behavior, preparing the next budget, or perhaps realistically \\nreassessing your behavior or original goals. \\nThe sooner you notice a budget variance, the sooner you can analyze it and, if necessary, \\nadjust for it. The sooner you correct the variance, the less it costs. For example, perhaps \\nyou have had a little trouble living within your means, so you have created a budget to \\nhelp you do so. You have worked out a plan so that total expenses are just as much as \\ntotal income. In your original budget you expected to have a certain expense for putting \\ngas in your car, which you figured by knowing the mileage that you drive and the current \\nprice of gas. You are following your budget and going along just fine. Suddenly, the price \\nof gas goes way up. So does your monthly expense. That means you’ll have to \\n• spend less for other expenses in order to keep your total expenses within your \\nbudget, \\n• lower your gas expense by driving less, and/or \\n• increase your income to accommodate this larger expense. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 124}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  125 \\nIn the short term, monitoring your gas expense alerts you to a need to change your \\nfinancial behavior by driving less, spending less on other things, or earning more. In the \\nlong run, if you find this increased expense intolerable, you will make other choices as \\nwell to avoid it. Perhaps you would buy a more fuel-efficient car, for example, or change \\nyour lifestyle to necessitate less driving. The number and feasibility of your choices will \\ndepend on your elasticity of demand for that particular budget item. But if you hadn’t \\nbeen paying attention, if you had not been monitoring your budget against the real \\noutcomes that were happening as they were happening, you would not have been aware \\nthat any change was needed, and you would have found yourself with a surprising \\nbudget deficit. \\nIt bears repeating that once you have discovered a significant budget variance, you need \\nto analyze what caused it so that you can address it properly. \\nIncome results from the sale of labor (wages) or liquidity (interest or dividends). If \\nincome deviates from its projection, it is because \\n• a different quantity of labor or liquidity was sold at the expected price (e.g., you \\nhad fewer house painting contracts than usual but kept your rates the same), \\n• the expected quantity of labor or liquidity was sold at a different price (e.g., you \\nhad the usual number of contracts but earned less from them), or \\n• a different quantity of labor or liquidity was sold at a different price (e.g., you had \\nfewer contracts and charged less to be more competitive). \\nExpenses result from consuming goods or services at a price. If an expense deviates \\nfrom its projected outcome, it is because \\n• a different quantity was consumed at the expected price (e.g., you did not use as \\nmuch gas), \\n• the expected quantity was consumed at a different price (e.g., you used as much \\ngas but the price of gas fell), or \\n• a different quantity was consumed at a different price (e.g., you used less gas and \\nbought it for less). \\nIsolating the cause of a variance is useful because different causes will dictate different \\nremedies or opportunities. For example, if your gas expense has increased, is it because \\nyou are driving more miles or because the price of gas has gone up? You can’t control \\nthe price of gas, but you can control the miles you drive. Isolating the cause allows you \\nto identify realistic choices. In this case, if the variance is too costly, you will need to \\naddress it by somehow driving fewer miles. \\nIf your income falls, is it because your hourly wage has fallen or because you are working \\nfewer hours? If your wage has fallen, you need to try to increase it either by negotiating \\nwith your employer or by seeking a new job at a higher wage. Your success will depend \\non demand in the labor market and on your usefulness as a supplier of labor. '),\n",

If the problem is with your employer, you may \\nneed to renegotiate your position or find a new one. However, if your employer is buying \\nless labor because of decreased demand in the labor market, that may be due to an \\nindustry or economic cycle, which may affect your success in making that change. \\nIf it is your choice of hours that has caused the variance, perhaps that is due to personal \\nfactors— you are aging or your dependents require more care and attention— that need to \\nbe resolved to allow you to work more.

Other tools include \\nfinancial statements, assessments of risk and the time value of money, macroeconomic \\nindicators, and microeconomic or personal factors. The usefulness of these tools is that \\nthey provide a clearer view of “what is” and “what is possible.” It puts your current \\nsituation and your choices into a larger context, giving you a better way to think about \\nwhere you are, where you’d like to be, and how to go from here to there. \\nMark has to decide whether to go ahead with the new roof. Assuming the house needs a \\nnew roof, his decision is really only about his choice of financing. An analysis of Mark’s \\nbudget variances has shown that he can actually pay for the roof with the savings in his \\nmoney market account. This means his goal is more attainable (and less costly) than in \\nhis original budget. This favorable outcome is due to his efforts to increase income and \\nreduce expenses and to macroeconomic changes that have been to his advantage. So, \\nMark can make progress toward his long-term goals of building his asset base. He can \\ncontinue saving for retirement with deposits to his retirement account and can continue \\nimproving his property with a new roof on his house. \\nBecause Mark is financing the roof with the savings from his money market account, he \\ncan avoid new debt and thus additional interest expense. He will lose the interest \\nincome from his money market account (which is insignificant as it represents only 0.09 \\npercent of his total income), but the increases from his tutoring and sales income will \\noffset the loss. Mark’s income statement will be virtually unaffected by the roof. His cash \\nflow statement will show unchanged operating cash flow, a large capital expenditure, \\nand use of savings. \\nMark can finance this increase of asset value (his new roof) with another asset, his \\nmoney market account.

Mark’s liquidity will \\nbe pretty much depleted by the roof, so future capital expenditures may have to be \\nfinanced with debt. If interest rates continue to rise, that will make financing future \\ncapital expenditures more expensive and perhaps will cause Mark to delay those \\nexpenditures or even cancel them. \\nHowever, Mark also has a very reliable source of liquidity in his earnings— his paycheck, \\nwhich can offset this loss. If he can continue to generate free cash flow to add to his \\nsavings, he can restore his money market account and his liquidity. Having no \\ndependents makes Mark more able to assume the risk of depleting his liquidity now and \\nrelying on his income to restore it later. \\nThe opportunity cost of losing liquidity and interest income will be less than the cost of \\nnew debt and new interest expense. That is because interest rates on loans are always \\nhigher than interest rates on savings. Banks always charge more than they pay for \\nliquidity. That spread, or difference between those two rates, is the bank’s profit, so the \\nbank’s cost of buying money will always be less than the price it sells for. The added risk \\nand obligation of new debt could also create opportunity cost and make it more difficult \\nto finance future capital expenditures. So financing the capital expenditure with an asset \\nrather than with a liability is less costly both immediately and in the future because it \\ncreates fewer obligations and more opportunities, less opportunity cost, and less risk. \\nThe budget and the financial statements allow Mark to project the effects of this \\nfinancial decision in the larger context of his current financial situation and ultimate \\nfinancial goals. His understanding of opportunity costs, liquidity, the time value of \\nmoney, and of personal and macroeconomic factors also helps him evaluate his choices \\nand their consequences. Mark can use this decision and its results to inform his next \\ndecisions and his ultimate horizons. \\nFinancial planning is a continuous process of making financial decisions. Financial \\nstatements and budgets are ways of summarizing the current situation and projecting \\nthe outcomes of choices. Financial statement analysis and budget variance analysis are \\nways of assessing the effects of choices. Personal factors, economic factors, and the \\nrelationships of time, risk, and value affect choices as their dynamics— how they work \\nand bear on decisions— affect outcomes. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Financial planning is a continuous process of making financial decisions. \\n• Financial statements are ways of summarizing the current situation. \\n• Budgets are ways of projecting the outcomes of choices. \\n• Financial statement analysis and budget variance analysis are ways of assess ing the effects of \\nchoices.

The design of that tax system reflects the society’s view of \\nthe responsibilities of government and of its citizens for their government. \\nIn the United States there has always been disagreement about the role of government \\nas a producer for and a protector of the economy and its citizens. Even before the United \\nStates was a nation, “taxation without representation” was a rallying cry for rebellion \\nagainst the British colonial authority, and the colonists protested taxes on everything \\nfrom stamps to tea. The American Revolution was as much about economic \\ndemocracy— the fundamental right of every individual to participate in the economy and \\nto own the fruits of labor— as it was about political democracy. \\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations was published in \\n1776, the same year that independence was declared in the thirteen colonies. Smith \\nrecognized a role for government in a market-based economy, but societies have argued \\nabout what that role should be and how it should be paid for ever since. The U.S. tax \\ncode is based on the idea that everyone should help finance the government according to \\none’s ability to pay. Changes in how “everyone” is defined and how “ability to pay” is \\nmeasured have led to tax law changes that keep the system evolving. \\nIn the United States, tax laws are written by Congress and therefore through \\ncompromise. As views on government financing have changed, tax laws have been \\namended and refined, enacted and repealed. The result is a tax code that can seem \\noverly complex and even unreasonable or illogical. However, the system is based on \\nlogic and has a purpose. The better you understand the elements of the tax system, the \\nbetter you will understand how to live with it— and plan for it— to your best advantage. \\n6.1 Sources of Taxation and Kinds of Taxes \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify the levels of government that impose taxes. \\n2. Define the different kinds of incomes, assets, and transactions that may be taxed. \\n3. Compare and contrast progressive and regressive taxes. \\nAny government that needs to raise revenue and has the legal authority to do so may \\ntax. Tax jurisdictions reflect government authorities. In the United States, federal, state, \\nand municipal governments impose taxes. Similarly, in many countries there are '),\n",

Regional economic alliances, \\nsuch as the European Union, may also levy taxes. \\nJurisdictions may overlap. For example, in the United States, federal, state, and local \\ngovernments may tax income, which becomes complicated for those earning income in \\nmore than one state, or living in one state and working in another. Governments tax \\nincome because it is a way to tax broadly based on the ability to pay. Most adults have an \\nincome from some source, even if it is a government distribution. Those with higher \\nincomes should be able to pay more taxes, and in theory should be willing to do so, for \\nthey have been more successful in or have benefited more from the economy that the \\ngovernment protects. \\nIncome tax is usually a progressive tax: the higher the income or the more to be \\ntaxed, the greater the tax rate. The percentage of income that is paid in tax increases as \\nincome rises. Those income categories are called tax brackets  \\n (Figure 6.2 \"U.S. Income Tax Brackets in 2008 (Single Filing Status)\"). \\nFigure 6.2 U.S. Income Tax Brackets in 2008 (Single Filing Status) \\n \\nSource: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_brackets.htm \\nTax is levied on income from many sources: \\n• Wages (selling labor) \\n• Interest, dividends, and gains from investment (selling capital) \\n• Self-employment (operating a business or selling a good or service) \\n• Property rental \\n• Royalties (rental of intellectual property) \\n'),\n",

In the \\nUnited States, sales taxes are imposed by state or local governments; as yet, there is no \\nnational sales tax. Sales taxes are said to be more efficient and fair in that consumption \\nreflects income (income determines ability to consume and therefore level of \\nconsumption). Consumption also is hard to hide, making sales tax a good way to collect \\ntaxes based on the ability to pay. Consumption taxes typically tax all consumption, \\nincluding nondiscretionary items such as food, clothing, and housing. Opponents of \\nsales tax argue that it is a regressive tax, because those with lower incomes must use a \\nhigher percentage of their incomes on nondiscretionary purchases than higher-income \\npeople do. \\nThe value-added tax (VAT) or goods and services tax (GST) is widely used outside the \\nUnited States. It is a consumption tax, but differs from the sales tax, which is paid only \\nby the consumer as an end user. With a VAT or GST, the value added to the product is \\ntaxed at each stage of production. Governments use a VAT or GST instead of a sales tax \\nto spread the tax burden among producers and consumers, and thus to reduce incentive \\nto evade the tax. A consumption tax, like the sales tax, it is a regressive tax. When \\ntraveling abroad, you should be aware that a VAT may add substantially to the cost of a \\npurchase (a meal, accommodations, etc.). \\nExcise taxes are taxes on specific consumption items such as alcohol, cigarettes, motor \\nvehicles, fuel, or highway use. In some states, excise taxes are justified by the \\ndiscretionary nature of the purchases and may be criticized as exercises in social \\nengineering (i.e., using the tax code to dictate social behaviors). For example, people \\naddicted to nicotine or alcohol tend to purchase cigarettes or liquor even if an excise tax \\nincreases their cost— and are therefore a reliable source of tax revenue. \\nProperty taxes are used by more local— state, municipal, provincial, and county—\\ngovernments, and are most commonly imposed on real property (land and buildings) \\nbut also on personal assets such as vehicles and boats. Property values theoretically \\nreflect wealth (accrued income) and thus ability to pay taxes. Property values are also a \\nmatter of public record (real property is deeded, boats or automobiles are licensed), \\nwhich allows more efficient tax collection. \\nEstate taxes are taxes on the transfer of wealth from the deceased to the living. Estate \\ntaxes are usually imposed on the very wealthiest based on their unusual ability to pay. \\nBecause death and the subsequent dispersal of property is legally a matter of public \\nrecord, estate taxes are generally easy to collect. Estate taxes are controversial because \\nthey can be seen as a tax on the very idea of ownership and on incomes that have already \\nbeen taxed and saved or stored as wealth and properties. Still, estate taxes are a \\nsubstantial source of revenue for the governments that use them, and so they remain. \\nA summary of the kinds of taxes used by the three different jurisdictions is shown in \\nFigure 6.3 \"Taxes and Jurisdictions\".

Personal financial planning \\nfocuses on your decisions as an individual or family unit, but other tax entities can affect \\nindividual income. Corporate profit may be distributed to individuals as a dividend, for \\nexample, which then becomes the individual’s taxable income. Likewise, funds \\nestablished for a specific purpose may distribute money to an individual that is taxable \\nas individual income. A trust, for example, is a legal arrangement whereby control over \\nproperty is transferred to a person or organization (the trustee) for the benefit of \\nsomeone else (the beneficiary). If you were a beneficiary and received a distribution, \\nthat money would be taxable as individual income. \\nThe definition of the taxable “individual” is determined by filing status: \\n• Single, never married, widowed, or divorced \\n'),\n",

Not everyone who files a return actually pays taxes, however. Individuals with \\nlow incomes and tax exempt, nonprofit corporations typically do not. All potential \\ntaxpayers nevertheless must declare income and show their obligations to the \\ngovernment. For the individual, that declaration is filed on Form 1040 (or, if your tax \\ncalculations are simple enough, Form 1040EZ). \\nIncome \\nFor individuals, the first step in the process is to calculate total income. Income may \\ncome from many sources, and each income must be calculated and declared. Some kinds \\nof income have a separate form or schedule to show their more detailed calculations. \\nThe following schedules are the most common for reporting incomes separately by \\nsource. \\nSchedule B: Interest and Dividend Income \\nInterest income is income from selling liquidity. For example, the interest that your \\nsavings account, certificates of deposit, and bonds earn in a year is income. You \\nessentially are earning interest from lending cash to a bank, a money market mutual \\nfund, a government, or a corporation (though not all your interest income may be \\ntaxable). Dividend income, on the other hand, is income from investing in the stock \\nmarket. Dividends are your share of corporate profits as a shareholder, distributed in \\nproportion to the number of shares of corporate stock you own. \\nSchedule C: Business Income \\nBusiness income is income from self-employment or entrepreneurial ventures or \\nbusiness enterprises. For sole proprietors and partners in a partnership, business \\nincome is the primary source of income. Many other individuals rely on wages, but have \\na small business on the side for extra income. Business expenses can be deducted from \\nbusiness income, including, for example, business use of your car and home. If expenses \\nare greater than income, the business is operating at a loss. Business losses can be \\ndeducted from total income, just as business income adds to total income. '),\n",

You \\nare considered to have a business for tax purposes if you made a profit in three of the \\npast five years including the current year, or if you are operating as a registered business \\nwith the intention of making a profit. If you are operating your own business you also \\nmust also pay self-employment tax on business income. In addition, the self-employed \\nmust pay estimated income taxes in quarterly installments based on expected income. \\nTariq is thinking about turning his hobby into a business. He has been successful buying \\nand selling South Asian folk art online. He thinks he has found a large enough market to \\nsupport a business enterprise. As a business he would be able to deduct the costs of Web \\nsite promotion, his annual art buying trip, his home office, and shipping, which would \\nreduce the taxes he would have to pay on his business income. Tariq decides to enroll in \\nonline courses on becoming an entrepreneur, how to write a business plan, and how to \\nfind capital for a new venture. \\nSchedule SE: Self-Employment Tax \\nSelf-employment tax is an additional tax on income from self-employment or business \\nincome earned by a sole proprietor. It represents the employer’s contribution to Social \\nSecurity, which is a mandatory retirement savings program of the federal government. \\nBoth employers and employees are required to contribute to the employee’s Social \\nSecurity account. When you are both the employee and the employer, as in self-\\nemployment, you must contribute both shares of the contribution. \\nSchedule D: Capital Gains (or Losses) \\nGains or losses from investments derive from changes in asset value during ownership \\nbetween the asset’s original cost and its market value at the time of sale. If you sell an \\nasset for more than you paid for it, you have a gain. If you sell an asset for less than you \\npaid for it, you have a loss. Recurring gains or losses from investment are from returns \\non financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. One-time gains or losses, such as the \\nsale of a home, are also reported on Schedule D. \\nThe tax code distinguishes between assets held for a short time— less than one year, and \\nassets held for a long time— one year or more. Short-term capital gains or losses are \\ntaxed at a different rate than long-term capital gains or losses (Figure 6.8 \"Capital Gains \\nTax Rates\"). When you invest in financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, \\nproperty, or equipment, be sure to keep good records by noting the date when you \\nbought them and the original price. These records establish the cost basis of your \\ninvestments, which is used to calculate your gain or loss when you sell them. \\nFigure 6.8 Capital Gains Tax Rates '),\n",

This can be a primary source of income, \\nalthough many individuals rely on wages and have some rental or royalty income on the \\nside. Home ownership may be made more affordable, for example, if the second half of a \\nduplex can be rented for extra income. Rental expenses can also be deducted from rental \\nincome, which can create a loss from rental activity rather than a gain. Unlike a \\nbusiness, which must become profitable to remain a business for tax purposes, rental \\nactivities may generate losses year after year. Such losses are a tax advantage, as they \\nreduce total income. \\nPartnerships and S corporations are alternative business structures for a business with \\nmore than one owner. For example, partnerships and S corporations are commonly \\nused by professional practices, such as accounting firms, law firms, medical practices, \\nand the like, as well as by family businesses. \\nThe partnership or S corporation is not a taxable entity, but the share of its profits \\ndistributed to each owner is taxable income for the owner and must be declared on \\nSchedule E. \\nSchedule F: Farm Income \\nFarm income is income from growing food, livestock, or livestock products, such as \\nwool, to sell. Farmers have a special status in the tax code, stemming from the original \\nagricultural basis of the U.S. economy and the strategic importance of self-sufficiency in \\nfood production. Thus, the tax code applies exemptions specifically to farmers. \\nOther Taxable and Nontaxable Income \\n'),\n",

Income that is not taxed by the U.S. government \\nand does not have to be reported as income includes the following: \\n• Welfare benefits \\n• Interest from most municipal bonds \\n• Most gifts \\n• Most inheritance and bequests \\n• Workers compensation \\n• Veteran’s benefits \\n• Federal tax refunds \\n• Some scholarships and fellowships \\nIt’s important to read tax filing instructions carefully, however, because not everything \\nyou’d think would qualify actually does. The government allows adjustments to be \\nreported (or not reported) as income only under certain circumstances or up to certain \\nincome limits, and some adjustments require special forms. \\nThe result of deducting adjustments from your total income is a calculation of your \\nadjusted gross income (AGI). Your AGI is further adjusted by amounts that may be \\ndeducted or exempted from your taxable income and by amounts already credited to \\nyour tax obligations. \\nDeductions, Exemptions, and Credits \\nDeductions and exemptions reduce taxable income, while credits reduce taxes. \\nDeductions are tax breaks for incurring certain expenditures or living in certain \\ncircumstances that the government thinks you should not have to include in your \\ntaxable income. There are deductions for age and for blindness. For other deductions, \\nthere is a standard, lump-sum deduction that you can take, or you may choose to itemize \\nyour deductions, that is, detail each one separately and then calculate the total. If your \\nitemized deductions are more than your standard deduction, it makes sense to itemize. \\nOther deductions involve financial choices that the government encourages by \\nrewarding an extra incentive in the form of a tax break. Home mortgage interest is a \\ndeduction to encourage home ownership, for example; investment interest is a \\ndeduction to encourage investment, and charitable donations are deductions to \\nencourage charitable giving. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 145}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  146 \\nDeductions are also created for expenditures that may be considered nondiscretionary, \\nsuch as medical and dental expenses, job-related expenses, or state and local income \\nand property taxes. As with income adjustments, you have to read the instructions \\ncarefully, however, to know what expenditures qualify as deductions. Some deductions \\nonly qualify if they amount to more than a certain percentage of income, while others \\nmay be deducted regardless. Some deductions require an additional form to calculate \\nspecifics, such as unreimbursed employee or job-related expenses, charitable gifts not \\ngiven in cash, investment interest, and some mortgage interest. \\nThere are exemptions based on the number of your dependents, who are usually \\nchildren, but may be elderly parents or disabled siblings, that is, relatives who generally \\ncannot care for themselves financially. Exemptions are made for dependents as \\nnondiscretionary expenditures, but the government also encourages individuals to care \\nfor their financially dependent children, parents, and siblings because without such care \\nthey might become dependents of a government safety net or a charity. \\nAfter deductions and exemptions are subtracted from adjusted gross income, the \\nremainder is your taxable income. Your tax is based on your taxable income, on a \\nprogressive scale. You may have additional taxes, such as self-employment tax, and you \\nmay be able to apply credits against your taxes, such as the earned income credit for \\nlower-income taxpayers with children. \\nDeductions, exemptions, and credits are some of the more disputed areas of the tax \\ncode. Because of the depth of dispute about them, they tend to change more frequently \\nthan other areas of the tax code. For example, in 2009, a credit was added to encourage \\nfirst-time homebuyers to purchase a home in the hopes of stimulating the residential \\nreal estate market. As a taxpayer, you want to stay alert to changes that may be to your \\nadvantage or disadvantage. Usually, such changes are phased in and out gradually so \\nyou can include them in your financial planning process. \\nPayments and Refunds \\nOnce you have calculated your tax obligation for the year, you can compare that to any \\ntaxes you have paid during the year and calculate the amount still owed or the amount \\nto be refunded to you. \\nYou pay taxes during the tax year by having them withheld from your paycheck if you \\nearn income through wages, or by making quarterly estimated tax payments if you have \\nother kinds of income. When you begin employment, you fill out a form (Form W-4) \\nthat determines the taxes to be withheld from your regular pay. You may adjust this \\namount, within limits, at any time. If you have both wages and other incomes, but your \\nwage income is your primary source of income, you may be able to increase the taxes \\nwithheld from your wages to cover the taxes on your other income, and thus avoid \\nhaving to make estimated payments. However, if your nonwage income is substantial, \\nyou will have to make estimated payments to avoid a penalty and/or interest. '),\n",

Steady payments also greatly decrease the risk of taxes being \\nuncollectible. State and local income taxes must also be paid during the tax year and are \\nsimilarly withheld from wages or paid quarterly. \\nBesides income taxes, other taxes are withheld from your wages: payments for Social \\nSecurity and Medicare. Social Security or the Federal Insurance Contributions Act \\n(FICA) and Medicare are federal government programs. Social Security is insurance \\nagainst loss of income due to retirement, disability, or loss of a spouse or parent. \\nIndividuals are eligible for benefits based on their own contributions— or their spouse’s \\nor parents’— during their working lives, so technically, the Social Security payment \\nwithheld from your current wages is not a tax but a contribution to your own deferred \\nincome. Medicare finances health care for the elderly. Both programs were designed to \\nprovide minimal benefits to those no longer able to sell their labor in exchange for wage \\nincome. In fact, both Social Security and Medicare function as “pay-as-you-go” systems, \\nso your contributions pay for benefits that current beneficiaries receive. \\nIf you have paid more during the tax year than your actual obligation, then you are due a \\nrefund of the difference. You may have that amount directly deposited to a bank \\naccount, or the government will send you a check. \\nIf you have paid less during the tax year than your actual obligation, then you will have \\nto pay the difference (by check or credit card) and you may have to pay a penalty and/or \\ninterest, depending on the size of your payment. \\nThe deadline for filing income tax returns and for paying any necessary amounts is April \\n15, following the end of the tax year on December 31. You may file to request an \\nextension of that deadline to August 15. Should you miss a deadline without filing for an \\nextension, you will owe penalties and interest, even if your actual tax obligation results \\nin a refund. It really pays to get your return in on time. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The most relevant tax for financial planning is the income tax, as it affects the taxpayer over an \\nentire lifetime. \\n• Different kinds of income must be defined and declared on specific income schedules and are \\nsubject to tax. \\n• Deductions and exemptions reduce taxable income. \\n• Credits reduce tax obligations. \\n• Payments are made throughout the tax year through withholding from wages or through \\nquarterly payments.

Identify sources of tax information. \\n2. Explain the importance of verifiable records and record keeping. \\n3. Compare sources of tax preparation assistance. \\n4. Trace the tax review process and its implications. \\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC), the federal tax law, is written by the U.S. Congress \\nand enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is a part of the U.S. \\nDepartment of Treasury. The IRS is responsible for the collection of tax revenues. To \\ncollect revenues, the IRS must inform the public of tax obligations and devise data \\ncollection systems that will allow for collection and verification of tax information so \\nthat collectible revenues can be verified. In other words, the IRS has to figure out how to \\ninform the public and collect taxes while also collecting enough information to be able to \\ncheck that those taxes are correct. \\nTo inform the public, the IRS has published over six hundred separate publications \\ncovering various aspects of the tax code. There are more than a thousand forms and \\naccompanying instructions to file complete tax information, although most taxpayers \\nactually file about half a dozen forms each year. In addition, the IRS provides a Web site \\n(http://www.irs.gov) and telephone support to answer questions and assist in preparing \\ntax filings. \\nBy far, most income taxes from wages are collected through withholding as earned. For \\nmost taxpayers, wages represent the primary form of income, and thus most of their tax \\npayments are withheld or paid as wages are earned. Still, everyone has to file to \\nsummarize the details of the year’s incomes for the IRS and to calculate the final tax \\nobligation. In 2007, the IRS collected 138,893,908 individual returns representing \\n$1.367 trillion of tax revenue.[1]  \\nKeeping Records \\nThe individual filer must collect and report the information on tax forms and schedules. \\nFortunately, this is not as difficult as the volume of data would suggest. Employers are \\nrequired to send Form W-2 to each employee at the end of the year, detailing the total \\nwages earned and taxes and contributions withheld. If you have earned other kinds of \\nincome, your clients, customers, retirement fund, or other source of income may have to \\nfile a Form 1099 to report that income to you and to the IRS. Interest and dividend \\nincome is also reported by the bank or brokerage firm on Form 1099. The W-2 and the \\nForm 1099 are reported to both the IRS and you. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 149}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  150 \\nThe system for filing tax information has purposeful redundancies. Where possible, \\ninformation is collected independently from at least two sources, so it can be verified. \\nFor example, your wage data is collected both from you and from your employer, your \\ninterest and dividend incomes are reported by both you and the bank or brokerage that \\npaid them, and so on. Those redundancies, wherever practical, allow for a system of \\ncross-references so that the IRS can check the validity of the data it receives. \\nIncomes may be summarized and reported to you, but only you know your expenses. \\nExpenditures are important if they are allowed as deductions, such as charitable gifts, \\nmedical and dental expenses, job-related expenses, and so on, so data should be \\ncollected throughout the tax year. If you do nothing more than keep a checkbook, then \\nyou will have to go through it and identify the deductible expenses for the tax year. \\nFinancial software applications will make that task easier; most allow you to flag \\ndeductible expenses in your initial setup. \\nYou should also keep receipts of purchases that may be deductible; credit or debit card \\nstatements and bank statements provide convenient backup proof of expenditures. \\nProof is needed in the event the IRS questions the accuracy of your return. \\nTax Preparation and Filing \\nAfter you have collected the information you need, you fill out the forms. The tax code is \\nbased on the idea that citizens should create revenues for the government based on their \\nability to pay— and the tax forms follow that logic. Most taxpayers need to complete only \\na few schedules and forms to supplement their Form 1040 (or 1040 EZ). Most taxpayers \\nhave the same kinds of taxable events, incomes, and deductions year after year and file \\nthe same kinds of schedules and forms. \\nMany taxpayers prefer to consult a professional tax preparer. Professional help is useful \\nif you have a relatively complicated tax situation: unusual sources of income or \\nexpenditures that may be deductible under unusual circumstances. Some taxpayers use \\na tax preparer simply to protect against making a mistake and having the error, \\nhowever, innocent, prove costly to fix. Fees for tax preparers depend on how complex \\nyour return is, the number of forms that need to be completed, and the type of \\nprofessional you consult. \\nProfessional tax preparers may be lawyers, accountants, personal financial planners, or \\ntax consultants. You may have an ongoing relationship with your tax preparer who may \\nalso be your accountant or financial planner, working with you on other financial \\ndecisions. Or you may consult a tax preparer simply on tax issues. You may want your \\ntax preparer to fill out and file the forms for you, or you may be looking for advice about \\nfuture financial decisions that have tax consequences. Tax preparers may be \\nindependent practitioners who work during tax season, or employees of a national chain \\nthat provide year-round tax services. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 150}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  151 \\nThere is no standard certification to be a professional tax preparer. An enrolled agent is \\nsomeone who has successfully passed training courses from the IRS. A certified public \\naccountant (CPA) has specific training and experience in accounting. When looking for a \\ntax preparer, your lawyer, accountant, or financial planner may be appropriate or may \\nbe able to make a recommendation. If your information is fairly straightforward, you \\nmay minimize costs by using a preparer who simply does taxes. If your situation \\ninvolves more complications, especially involving other entities such as businesses or \\ntrusts, or unusual circumstances such as a gain, gift, or distribution, you may want to \\nconsult a professional with a range of expertise, such as an accountant or a lawyer who \\nspecializes in taxes. Many professionals also offer a “guarantee,” that is, that they will \\nalso help you if the information on your return is later questioned by the IRS. \\nWhether you prepare your tax return by yourself or with a professional, it is you who \\nmust sign the return and assume responsibility for its details. You should be sure to \\nreview your return with your tax preparer so that you understand and can explain any of \\nthe information found on it. You should question anything that you cannot understand \\nor that seems contrary to your original information. You should also know your tax \\nreturn because understanding how and why tax obligations are created or avoided can \\nhelp you plan for tax consequences in future financial decisions. \\nYou may choose to prepare the return yourself using a tax preparation software \\napplication. There are many available, and several that are compatible with personal \\nfinancial software applications, enabling you to download or transfer data from your \\nfinancial software directly into the tax software. Software applications are usually \\ndesigned as a series of questions that guide you through Form 1040 and the \\nsupplemental schedules, filling in the data from your answers. Once you have been \\nthrough the “questionnaire,” it tells you the forms it has completed for you, and you can \\nsimply print them out to submit by mail or “e-file” them directly to the IRS. Most \\nprograms also allow you to enter data into the individual forms directly. \\nMany tax preparation software packages are available, and many are reviewed in the \\nbusiness press or online. Some popular programs include the following (see http://tax-\\nsoftware- review.toptenreviews.com): \\n• Turbo Tax \\n• Tax Cut \\n• Tax \\n• ACT \\n• Complete Tax \\n• TaxSlayer Premium \\n• TaxBrain 1040 Deluxe \\n• OLT Online Taxes \\nSoftware can be useful in that it automatically calculates unusual circumstances, \\nlimitations, or exceptions to rules using your complete data. Some programs even \\nprompt you for additional information based on the data you submit. Overlooking \\nexceptions is a common error that software programs can help you avoid. The programs '),\n",

Once your return is completed, you must file it with the IRS, either \\nby mail or by e-file, which has become increasingly popular. \\nFollowing Up \\nAfter you file your tax return it will be processed and reviewed by the IRS. If you are \\nowed a refund, it will be sent; if you paid a payment, it will be deposited. The IRS \\nreviews returns for accuracy, based on redundant reporting and its “sense” of your data. \\nFor example, the IRS may investigate any discrepancies between the wages you report \\nand the wages your employer reports. As another example, if your total wages are \\n$23,000 and you show a charitable contribution of $20,000, that contribution seems \\ntoo high for your income— although there may be an explanation. \\nThe IRS may follow up by mail or by a personal interview. It may just ask for verification \\nof one or two items, or it may conduct a full audit— a thorough financial investigation of \\nyour return. In any case, you will be asked to produce records or receipts that will verify \\nyour reported data. Therefore, it is important to save a copy of your return and the \\nrecords and receipts that you used to prepare it. The IRS has the following \\nrecommendations for the number of years to save your tax data: \\n1. If you owe additional tax and situations 2, 3, and 4 below do not apply to you, \\nkeep records for three years. \\n2. If you do not report income that you should report, and it is more than 25 percent \\nof the gross income shown on your return, keep records for six years. \\n3. If you file a fraudulent return, keep records indefinitely. \\n4. If you do not file a return, keep records indefinitely. \\n5. If you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return, keep records for \\nthree years from the date you filed your original return or two years from the date \\nyou paid the tax, whichever is later. \\n6. If you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction, keep \\nrecords for seven years. \\n7. Keep all employment tax records for at least four years after the date that the tax \\nbecomes due or is paid, whichever is later. \\nIf you have a personal interview, your tax preparer may accompany you to help explain \\nand verify your return. Ultimately, however, you are responsible for it. If you have made \\nerrors, and if those errors result in a larger tax obligation (if you owe more), you may \\nhave to pay penalties and interest in addition to the tax you owe. You may be able to \\nnegotiate a payment schedule with the IRS. \\nThe IRS randomly chooses a certain number of returns each year for review and \\npossible audit even where no discrepancies or unusual items are noticed. The threat of a \\nrandom audit may deter taxpayers from cheating or taking shortcuts on their tax '),\n",

Computerized record keeping has made it easier for both taxpayers and the IRS \\nto collect, report, and verify tax data. \\nFiling Strategies \\nMost citizens recognize the need to contribute to the government’s revenues but want to \\navoid paying more than they need to. Tax avoidance is the practice of ensuring that \\nyou have no excess tax obligations. Strategies for minimizing or avoiding tax obligations \\nare perfectly legal. However, tax evasion— fraudulently reporting tax obligations, for \\nexample, by understating incomes and gains or overstating expenses and losses— is \\nillegal. \\nTiming can affect the value of taxable incomes or deductibles expenses. If you anticipate \\na significant increase in income— and therefore in your tax rate— in the next tax year, \\nyou may try to defer a deductible expense. When you have more income and it is taxed \\nat a higher rate, a deductible expense may be worth more as a tax savings to offset your \\nincome. For example, if your tax rate is 20 percent and your deductible expense of $100 \\nsaves you from paying taxes on $100, then it saves you $20 in taxes. If your tax rate is \\n35 percent, that same $100 deductible saves you $35. Likewise, if you anticipate a \\ndecrease in income that will decrease your tax rate, you may want to defer receipt of \\nincome until the next year when it will be taxed at a lower rate. In addition, some kinds \\nof incomes are taxed at different rates than others, so how your income is created may \\nbear on how much tax it creates. \\nThe definition of expenses and the way you claim them can affect the tax they save. You \\nmay be able to deduct more expenses if you itemize your deductions than if you do not, \\nor it may not make a difference. Also, there is some discretion in classifying expenses. \\nFor example, suppose you are a high school Spanish teacher. You also tutor students \\nprivately. You buy Spanish books to improve your own language skills and to keep \\ncurrent with the published literature. Are the costs of those books an unreimbursed \\nemployee expense related to your job as a teacher, or are they an expense of your private \\ntutoring business? \\nThey may be both, but you can only claim the expense once or in one place on your tax \\nreturn. If you claim it as an employment-related expense, your ability to deduct the cost \\nmay be limited, but if it is a cost of your tutoring business, you may be able to fully \\nexpense it from your business income. \\nAn income that is not taxed or taxed at a lower rate is more valuable than an income \\nthat is taxed or taxed at a higher rate. An expense that is fully deductible is more \\nvaluable than an expense that is not. Taxes deferred— by delaying income or accelerating \\nexpense— create more liquidity and thus more value. However, taxable income is still \\nincome, and a deductible expense is still an expense. Tax consequences should not \\nobscure the benefits of enjoying income and the costs of incurring expenses.

In truth, with the \\nincreased sophistication of computerization, the review process is much better at \\nnoticing real discrepancies and at choosing audits randomly. Time and effort (and cost) \\ninvested in outsmarting a possible audit is usually wasted. The best protection against a \\npossible audit is to have verification— a receipt or a bill or a canceled check— for all the \\nincomes and expenses that you report. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Tax code information is available from the Internal Revenue Service. \\n• Verifiable records must be kept for all taxable incomes and expenses or other taxable events and \\nactivities. \\n• Professional tax assistance and tax preparation software are readily available.  \\n• The Internal Revenue Service reviews tax returns for errors and may follow up through an \\ninformal or formal audit process. \\n• Tax avoidance is the legal practice of minimizing tax obligations. \\n• Tax evasion is the illegal process of fraudulently presenting information used in calculating tax \\nobligations. \\n• Tax avoidance strategies can involve the timing of incomes and/or expenses to take advantage of \\nchanging tax circumstances. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Your \\nfamily structure does not include dependents, so you have few deductions but also low \\ntaxable income. \\nAs you progress in your career, you can expect wages, expenses, and dependents to \\nincrease. You are building an asset base by buying a home, possibly saving for your \\nchildren’s education, or saving for retirement. Because those are the kinds of assets \\nencouraged by the government, they not only build wealth but also create tax \\nadvantages— the mortgage interest deduction, retirement, or education savings \\nexemption. \\nIn older adulthood, you may begin to build an asset base that can no longer provide \\nthose tax advantages that are limited or may create taxable income such as interest, \\ndividends, or rental income. In retirement, most people can anticipate a significant \\ndecrease in income from wages and a significant increase in reliance on incomes from \\ninvestments such as interest, dividends, and gains. Some of those assets may be \\nretirement savings accounts, such as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or 401(k) \\nthat created tax advantages while growing, but will create tax obligations as income is \\ndrawn from them. \\nGenerally, you can expect your income to increase during your middle adult life, but that \\nis when many people typically have dependents and deductions such as mortgage \\ninterest and job-related expenses to offset increased tax obligations. As you age, and \\nespecially when you retire, you can expect less income and also fewer deductions: any \\nkids have left home, the mortgage in paid off. \\nThe bigger picture is that at the stages of your life when income is increasing, so are your \\ndeductions and exemptions, which tend to decrease as your income decreases. Although \\nyour incomes change over your lifetime, you tax obligations change proportionally, so \\nthey remain relative to your ability to pay. \\nThe tax consequences of such changes should be anticipated and considered as you \\nevaluate choices for financial strategies.

You can usually be aware of any tax code changes far enough in \\nadvance to incorporate them into your planning. \\nTax Strategies and Personal Financial Planning \\nTax advantages are sometimes created for personal financial strategies as a way of \\nencouraging certain personal goals. In the United States, as in most developed \\neconomies, certain goals such as home ownership, retirement savings, and education \\nand health financing are seen as personal goals that benefit society as well as the \\nindividual. \\nIn most cases, tax advantages are created to encourage progress toward those goals. For \\nexample, most people can buy a home only if they can use debt financing, which creates \\nadded costs. So mortgage interest, that added cost, is tax deductible (up to a limit) to \\nmake home financing and therefore home ownership more affordable and attractive. \\nRetirement saving is encouraged, so some savings plans such as an IRA or a \\ndefined contribution plan such as a 401(k) or a 403b (so named for the sections of \\nthe Internal Revenue Code that define them) create tax advantages. The deposits made \\nto those plans may be used to reduce taxable income, although there are limits to the \\namount of those deposits. There are also retirement savings strategies that do not create \\ntax advantages, such as saving outside of a tax-advantaged account. There are limited \\ntax-advantaged savings accounts for education savings and health care expenses as well. \\nWhere you have a choice, it makes sense to use a strategy that will allow you to make \\nprogress toward your goal and realize a tax advantage. Your enthusiasm for the tax \\nadvantage should not define your goals, however. Taxes affect the value of your \\nalternatives, so recognizing tax implications should inform your choices without \\ndefining your goals. \\nUnanticipated events such as an inheritance, a gift, lottery winnings, casualty and theft \\nlosses, or medical expenses can also have tax consequences. They are often unusual \\nevents (and therefore unanticipated) and may be unfamiliar and financially \\ncomplicated. In those circumstances it may be wise to consult an expert. \\nYour financial plans should reflect your vision for your life: what you want to have, how \\nyou want to get it, how you want to protect it. You will want to be aware of tax \\nadvantages or disadvantages, but tax consequences should not drive your vision. You \\nwould not buy a house with a mortgage only to get the mortgage interest deduction, for \\nexample. However, if you are buying a home, you can plan to do so in the most tax-\\nadvantageous way. \\nAs Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., said, “Taxes are what we pay for \\na civilized society.”[1]  '),\n",

You have two sources for money: yourself or someone else. You need to \\ndecide when to use whose money and how to do so as efficiently as possible: maximizing \\nbenefit and minimizing cost. As with all financial decisions, you also need to think about \\nthe strategic consequences for future decisions. \\nYou can use your own money as a source of financing if your income is at least equal to \\nyour living expenses. If it is more, you have a budget surplus that can be saved and used \\nas a source of future financing while earning income at the same time. If your own \\nincome is less than the expenses, you have a budget deficit that will require another \\nexternal source of financing— someone else’s money— that will add an expense. Ideally, \\nyou want to avoid the additional expense of borrowing and instead create the additional \\nincome from saving. The budgeting techniques discussed in Chapter 5 \"Financial Plans: \\nBudgets\" are helpful in seeing this picture more clearly. \\nYour ability to save will vary over your lifetime, as your family structure, age, career \\nchoice, and health will change. Those “micro” factors determine your income and \\nexpenses and thus your ability to create a budget surplus and your own internal \\nfinancing. Likewise, your need to use external financing, such as credit or debt, will vary \\nwith your income, expenses, and ability to save. \\nAt times, unexpected change can turn a budget surplus into a budget deficit (e.g., a \\nsudden job loss or increased health expenses), and a saver can reluctantly become a \\nborrower. Being able to recognize that change and understand the choices for financing \\nand managing cash flow will help you create better strategies. \\nFinancing can be used to purchase a long-term asset that will generate income, reduce \\nexpense, or create a gain in value, and it may be useful when those benefits outweigh the \\ncost of the debt. The benefit of long-term assets is also influenced by personal factors. \\nFor example, a house may be more useful, efficient, and valuable when families are \\nlarger. \\nMacroeconomic factors, such as the economic cycle, employment, and inflation, should \\nbear on your financing decisions as well. Your incomes and expenses are affected by the \\neconomy’s expansion or contraction, especially as it affects your own employment or \\nearning potential. Inflation or deflation, or an expected devaluation or appreciation of \\nthe currency, affects interest rates as both lenders and borrowers anticipate using or \\nreturning money that has changed in value. \\nFinancial management decisions become more complicated when the personal and \\nmacroeconomic factors become part of the decision process, but the result is a more '),\n",

Financial management decisions, however, are difficult not because of their \\ncomplexity, but because the way you can finance your assets and expenses (i.e., lifestyle) \\ndetermines the life that you live. The stakes are high. \\n7.1 Your Own Money: Cash \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify the cash flows and instruments used to manage income deposits and expense payments.  \\n2. Explain the purpose of check balancing. \\nMost people use a checking account as their primary means of managing cash flows \\nfor daily living. Incomes from wages and perhaps from investments are deposited to this \\naccount, and expenses are paid from it. The actual deposit of paychecks and writing of \\nchecks, however, has been made somewhat obsolete as more cash flow services are \\nprovided electronically. \\nWhen incoming funds are distributed regularly, such as a paycheck or a government \\ndistribution, direct deposit is preferred. For employers and government agencies, it \\noffers a more efficient, timely, and secure method of distributing funds. For the \\nrecipient, direct deposit is equally timely and secure and can allow for a more efficient \\ndispersal of funds to different accounts. For example, you may have some of your \\npaycheck directly deposited to a savings account, while the rest is directly deposited to \\nyour checking account to pay living expenses. Because you never “see” the money that is \\nsaved, it never passes through the account that you “use,” so you are less likely to spend \\nit. \\nWithdrawals or payments have many electronic options. Automatic payments may \\nbe scheduled to take care of a periodic payment (i.e., same payee, same amount) such as \\na mortgage or car payment. They may also be used for periodic expenses of different \\namounts— for example, utility or telephone expenses. A debit card may be used to \\ndirectly transfer funds at the time of purchase; money is withdrawn from your account \\nand transferred to the payee’s with one quick swipe at checkout. An \\nATM (automated teller machine) card offered by a bank allows for convenient \\naccess to the cash in your bank accounts through instant cash withdrawals. \\nThe bank clears these transactions as it manages your account, providing statements of \\nyour cash activities, usually monthly and online. When you reconcile your record \\nkeeping (i.e., your checkbook or software accounts) with the bank’s statement, you are \\nbalancing your checking account. This ensures that your records and the bank’s records \\nare accurate and that your information and account balance and the bank’s are up to \\ndate. Banks do make mistakes, and so do you, so it is important to check and be sure \\nthat the bank’s version of events agrees with yours. '),\n",

In My Notes or your personal finance journal, inventory in detail all the vehicles you use for \\nmanaging your cash flows. Include all your accounts that are mediated through banks and finance \\ncompanies. Also, list your cards issued by banks, such as debit or ATM cards, and identify any \\ndirect deposits and automatic payments that are made through your savings and checking \\naccounts. How might you further enhance your cash management through the use of banking \\ntools? \\n2. Does your bank offer online banking services, such as electronic bill payment? View your b ank \\nand others (such as http://www.ingdirect.com) online to learn more about Internet banking. \\nWhat products and services do online branches and banks offer? Do you (or would you) use those \\nproducts and services? Why (or why not)? Discuss online banking with classmates. What do they \\nidentify as the main benefits and risks of electronic banking? \\n7.2 Your Own Money: Savings \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify the markets and institutions used for saving. \\n2. Compare and contrast the instruments used for saving. \\n3. Analyze a savings strategy in terms of its liquidity and risk. \\nWhen incomes are larger than expenses, there is a budget surplus, and that surplus can \\nbe saved. You could keep it in your possession and store it for future use, but then you \\nhave the burden of protecting it from theft or damage. More important, you create an \\nopportunity cost. Because money trades in markets and liquidity has value, your \\nalternative is to lend that liquidity to someone who wants it more than you do at the \\nmoment and is willing to pay for its use. Money sitting idle is an opportunity cost. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  162 \\nThe price that you can get for your money has to do with supply and demand for \\nliquidity in the market, which in turn has to do with a host of other macroeconomic \\nfactors. It also has a lot to do with time, opportunity cost, and risk. If you are willing to \\nlend your liquidity for a long time, then the borrower has more possible uses for it, and \\nincreased mobility increases its value. However, while the borrower has more \\nopportunity, you (the seller) have more opportunity cost because you give up more \\nchoices over a longer period of time. That also creates more risk for you, since more can \\nhappen over a longer period of time. The longer you lend your liquidity, the more \\ncompensation you need for your increased opportunity cost and risk. \\nSavings Markets \\nThe markets for liquidity are referred to as the money markets and the \\ncapital markets. The money markets are used for relatively short-term, low-risk \\ntrading of money, whereas the capital markets are used for relatively long-term, higher-\\nrisk trading of money. The different time horizons and risk tolerances of the buyers, and \\nespecially the sellers, in each market create different ways of trading or packaging \\nliquidity. \\nWhen individuals are saving or investing for a long-term goal (e.g., education or \\nretirement) they are more likely to use the capital markets; their longer time horizon \\nallows for greater use of risk to earn return. Saving to finance consumption relies more \\non trading liquidity in the money markets, because there is usually a shorter horizon for \\nthe use of the money. Also, most individuals are less willing to assume opportunity costs \\nand risks when it comes to consumption, thus limiting the time that they are willing to \\nlend liquidity. \\nWhen you save, you are the seller or lender of liquidity. When you use someone else’s \\nmoney or when you borrow, you are the buyer of liquidity. \\nSavings Institutions \\nFor most individuals, access to the money markets is done through a bank. A bank \\nfunctions as an intermediary or “middleman” between the individual lender of money \\n(the saver) and the individual borrower of money. \\nFor the saver or lender, the bank can offer the convenience of finding and screening the \\nborrowers, and of managing the loan repayments. Most important, a bank can \\nguarantee the lender a return: the bank assumes the risk of lending. For the borrowers, \\nthe bank can create a steady supply of surplus money for loans (from the lenders), and \\narrange standard loan terms for the borrowers. \\nBanks create other advantages for both lenders and borrowers. Intermediation allows \\nfor the amounts loaned or borrowed to be flexible and for the maturity of the loans to \\nvary. That is, you don’t have to lend exactly the amount someone wants to borrow for \\nexactly the time she or he wants to borrow it. The bank can “disconnect” the lender and '),\n",

By having many lenders and many borrowers, the \\nbank diversifies the supply of and demand for money, and thus lowers the overall risk in \\nthe money market. \\nThe bank can also develop expertise in screening borrowers to minimize risk and in \\nmanaging and collecting the loan payments. In turn, that reduced risk allows the bank \\nto attract lenders and diversify supply. Through diversification and expertise, banks \\nultimately lower the cost of lending and borrowing liquidity. Since they create value in \\nthe market (by lowering costs), banks remain as intermediaries or middlemen in the \\nmoney markets. \\nThere are different kinds of banks based on what kind of brokering of money the bank \\ndoes. Those differences have become less distinct as the banking industry consolidates \\nand strives to offer more universal services. In the last generation, decreasing bank \\nregulation, increasing globalization, and technology have all contributed to that trend. \\nDifferent kinds of banks are listed below. \\n• Retail banks have focused on consumer saving and borrowing. \\n• Commercial banks have focused on operating cash flow management for \\nbusinesses. \\n• Investment banks have focused on long-term financing for businesses. \\nRetail banks are commonly known as thrift institutions, savings banks, savings and loan \\nassociations, or mutual savings banks and are usually private or public corporations. \\nCredit unions function similarly, but are cooperative membership organizations, with \\ndepositors as members. \\nIn addition to banks, other kinds of intermediaries for savers include pension funds, life \\ninsurance companies, and investment funds. They focus on saving for a particular long-\\nterm goal. To finance consumption, however, most individuals primarily use banks. \\nSome intermediaries have moved away from the “bricks-and-mortar” branch model and \\nnow operate as online banks, either entirely or in part. There are cost advantages for the \\nbank if it can use online technologies in processing saving and lending. Those cost \\nsavings can be passed along to savers in the form of higher returns on savings accounts \\nor lower service fees. Most banks offer online and, increasingly, mobile account access, \\nvia cell phone or smartphone. Intermediaries operating as finance companies offer \\nsimilar services. \\nBecause their role as intermediaries is critical to the flow of funds, banks are regulated \\nby federal and state governments. Since the bank failures of the Great Depression, bank \\ndeposits are federally insured (up to $250,000) through the FDIC (Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Corporation). Since the financial crisis of 2007–2009, bank money market \\nfunds also are insured. Credit union accounts are similarly insured by the National \\nCredit Union Agency or NCUA, also an independent federal agency. In choosing an \\nintermediary, savers should make sure that accounts are FDIC or NCUA insured. '),\n",

You give up more liquidity when \\nyou agree to commit to a minimum time or amount of money to save or lend. \\nFor the saver, a demand deposit (e.g., checking account) typically earns no or very \\nlow interest but allows complete liquidity on demand. Checking accounts that do not \\nearn interest are less useful for savings and therefore more useful for cash management. \\nSome checking accounts do earn some interest, but often require a minimum balance. \\nTime deposits, or savings accounts, offer minimal interest or a bit more interest with \\nminimum deposit requirements. \\nIf you are willing to give up more liquidity, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a \\nhigher price for liquidity but extract a time commitment enforced by a penalty for early \\nwithdrawal. They are offered for different maturities, which are typically from six \\nmonths to five years, and some have minimum deposits as well. Banks also can offer \\ninvestments in money market mutual funds (MMMFs)A savings instrument invested in \\nthe money markets., which offer a higher price for liquidity because your money is put \\nto use in slightly higher-risk investments, such as Treasury bills (short-term government \\ndebt) and commercial paper (short-term corporate debt). \\nCompared to the capital markets, the money markets have very little risk, so MMMFs \\nare considered very low-risk investments. The trade-offs between liquidity and return \\nare seen in Figure 7.3 \"Savings Products versus Liquidity and Risk\". \\nFigure 7.3 Savings Products versus Liquidity and Risk \\n \\nAs long as your money remains in your account, including any interest earned while it is \\nthere, you earn interest on that money. If you do not withdraw the interest from your \\naccount, it is added to your principal balance, and you earn interest on both. This is \\nreferred to as earning interest on interest, or compounding. The rate at which your \\nprincipal compounds is the annual percentage rate (APR) that your account earns. \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 164}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  165 \\nYou can calculate the eventual value of your account by using the relationships of time \\nand value that we looked at in Chapter 4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\"—\\nthat is, \\nFV=PV× (1+r) t ,  \\nwhere FV = future value, PV = present value, r = rate, and t = time. The balance in your \\naccount today is your present value, PV; the APR is your rate of compounding, r; the \\ntime until you will withdraw your funds is t. Your future value depends on the rate at \\nwhich you can earn a return or the rate of compounding for your present account. \\nIf you are depositing a certain amount each month or with each paycheck, that stream of \\ncash flows is an annuity. You can use the annuity relationships discussed in Chapter 4 \\n\"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\" to project how much the account will be \\nworth at any point in time, given the rate at which it compounds. Many financial \\ncalculators— both online and handheld— can help you make those calculations. \\nIdeally, you would choose a bank’s savings instrument that offers the highest APR and \\nmost frequent compounding. However, interest rates change, and banks with savings \\nplans that offer higher yields often require a minimum deposit, minimum balance, \\nand/or a maintenance fee. Also, your interest from savings is taxable, as it is considered \\nincome. As you can imagine, however, with monthly automatic deposits into a savings \\naccount with compounding interest, you can see your wealth can grow safely. \\nSavings Strategies \\nYour choice of savings instrument should reflect your liquidity needs. In the money \\nmarkets, all such instruments are relatively low risk, so return will be determined by \\nopportunity cost. \\nYou do not want to give up too much liquidity and then risk being caught short, because \\nthen you will have to become a borrower to make up that shortfall, which will create \\nadditional costs. If you cannot predict your liquidity needs or you know they are \\nimmediate, you should choose products that will least restrict your liquidity choices. If \\nyour liquidity needs are more predictable or longer term, you can give up liquidity \\nwithout creating unnecessary risk and can therefore take advantage of products, such as \\nCDs, that will pay a higher price. \\nYour expectations of interest rates will contribute to your decision to give up liquidity. If \\nyou expect interest rates to rise, you will want to invest in shorter-term maturities, so as \\nto regain your liquidity in time to reinvest at higher rates. If you expect interest rates to \\nfall, you would want to invest in longer-term maturities so as to maximize your earnings \\nfor as long as possible before having to reinvest at lower rates. \\nOne strategy to maximize liquidity is to diversify your savings in a series of instruments \\nwith differing maturities. If you are using CDs, the strategy is called “CD laddering.” For '),\n",

You have \\nno immediate liquidity needs but would like to keep $1,000 easily available for \\nemergencies. If a one-year CD is offering a 1.5 percent return, the more savings you put \\ninto the CD, the more return you will earn, but the less liquidity you will have. \\nA “laddering” strategy allows you to maximize return and liquidity by investing $1,000 \\nper month by buying a one-year CD. After twelve months, all your savings is invested in \\ntwelve CDs, each earning 1.5 percent. But because one CD matures each month, you \\nhave $1,000 worth of liquidity each month. You can keep the strategy going by \\nreinvesting each CD as it matures. Your choices are shown in Figure 7.4 \"CD Laddering \\nStrategy\". \\nFigure 7.4 CD Laddering Strategy \\n \\nA laddering strategy can also reflect expectations of interest rates. If you believe that \\ninterest rates or the earnings on your money will increase, then you don’t want to \\ncommit to the currently offered rates for too long. Your laddering strategy may involve a \\nseries of relatively short-term (less than one year) instruments. On the other hand, if \\nyou expect interest rates to fall, you would want to weight your laddering strategy to \\nlonger-term CDs, keeping only your minimum liquidity requirement in the shorter-term \\nCDs. \\nThe laddering strategy is an example of how diversifying maturities can maximize both \\nearnings and liquidity. In order to save at all, however, you have to choose to save \\nincome that could otherwise be spent, suffering the opportunity cost of everything that \\nyou could have had instead.

Identify common features of a credit card. \\n5. Discuss remedies for credit card trouble. \\n6. Summarize government’s role in protecting lenders and borrowers. \\n “Credit” derives from the Latin verb credere (to believe). It has several meanings as a \\nverb in common usage— to recognize with respect, to acknowledge a contribution— but \\nin finance, it generally means to allow delayed payment. \\nBoth credit and debt are forms of borrowing. Credit is distinguished from debt in both \\nits purpose and duration or timing, although in casual conversation the words are used \\ninterchangeably. Credit is used to purchase goods and services, to finance living \\nexpenses, or to make payments more convenient by delaying them for a relatively short \\ntime. Debt, on the other hand, is used to finance the purchase of assets— such as a car or \\na home— rather than to delay payment of recurring expenses. \\nThe costs of credit and of debt are likewise different, given their different uses and time \\nhorizons. Often, people get into some trouble when they cannot distinguish between the \\ntwo and choose the wrong form of financing at the wrong time. Figure 7.6 \"Credit versus \\nDebt\" distinguishes credit from debt. \\nFigure 7.6 Credit versus Debt \\n \\nKinds of Credit \\nCredit is issued either as installment credit or as revolving credit. Installment creditA \\nform of credit used to purchase consumer durables, usually issued by one vendor for one \\nitem. is typically issued by one vendor, such as a department store, for a specific \\npurchase. The vendor screens the applicant and extends credit, bearing the \\ndefault risk, or risk of nonpayment. Payments are made until that amount is paid for. \\nPayments include a portion of the cost of the purchase and the cost of the credit itself, or \\ninterest. \\nInstallment credit is an older form of credit that became popular for the purchase of \\nconsumer durables (i.e., furniture, appliances, electronics, or household items) after the \\nFirst World War. This form of credit expanded as mass production and invention made \\nconsumer durables such as radios and refrigerators widely available. (Longer-term \\ninstallment purchases for bigger-ticket assets, such as a car or property, are considered \\ndebt.) \\n'),\n",

Such credit is lent by a bank or finance company, \\ntypically through a charge card or a credit card. The charge card balance must be \\npaid in full in each period or credit cycle, while the credit card balance may not be, \\nrequiring only a minimum payment. \\nThe credit card is a more recent form of credit, as its use became widely practical only \\nwith the development of computing technology. The first charge card was the Diners’ \\nClub card, issued in 1950. The first credit card was the Bank Americard (now called \\nVisa), issued by Bank of America in 1958, which was later followed by MasterCard in \\n1966. Retailers can also issue revolving credit (e.g., a store account or credit card) to \\nencourage purchases. \\nCredit cards are used for convenience and security. Merchants worldwide accept credit \\ncards as a method of payment because the issuer (the bank or finance company) has \\nassumed the default risk by guaranteeing the merchants’ payment. Use of a credit card \\nabroad also allows consumers to incur less transaction cost. \\nThis universal acceptance allows a consumer to rely less on cash, so consumers can \\ncarry less cash, which therefore is less likely to be lost or stolen. Credit card payments \\nalso create a record of purchases, which is convenient for later record keeping. When \\nbanks and finance companies compete to issue credit, they often offer gifts or rewards to \\nencourage purchases. \\nCredit cards create security against cash theft, but they also create opportunities for \\ncredit fraud and even for identity theft. A lost or stolen credit card can be used to extend \\ncredit to a fraudulent purchaser. It can also provide personal information that can then \\nbe used to assume your financial identity, usually without your knowing it. Therefore, \\nhandle your credit cards carefully and be aware of publicized fraud alerts. Check your \\ncredit card statements for erroneous or fraudulent charges and notify the issuer \\nimmediately of any discrepancies, especially if the card is lost or stolen. Failure to do so \\nmay leave you responsible for purchases you did not make— or enjoy. \\nCosts of Credit \\nCredit has become a part of modern transactions, largely enabled by technology, and a \\nmatter of convenience and security. It is easy to forget that credit is a form of borrowing \\nand thus has costs. Understanding those costs helps you manage them. \\nBecause consumer credit is all relatively short term, its cost is driven more by risk than \\nby opportunity cost, which is the risk of default or the risk that you will fail to repay with \\nthe amounts advanced to you. The riskier the borrower seems to be, the fewer the \\nsources of credit. The fewer sources of credit available to a borrower, the more credit \\nwill cost. \\nMeasuring Risk: Credit Ratings and Reports '),\n",

That evaluation results in a credit score, which lenders use to determine their \\nwillingness to lend and their price. \\nIf you have ever applied for consumer credit (a revolving, installment, or personal loan) \\nyou have been evaluated and given a credit score. The information you write on your \\ncredit application form, such as your name, address, income, and employment, is used \\nto research the factors for calculating your credit score, also known as a FICO (Fair Isaac \\nCorporation) score after the company that developed it. \\nIn the United States, there are currently three major credit rating agencies: Experian, \\nEquifax, and TransUnion. Each calculates your score a bit differently, but the process is \\ncommon. They assign a numerical value to five characteristics of your financial life and \\nthen compile a weighted average score. Scores range from 300 to 900; the higher your \\nscore, the less risky you appear to be. The five factors that determine your credit score \\nare \\n1. your payment history, \\n2. amounts you currently owe, \\n3. the length of credit history, \\n4. new credit issued to you, \\n5. the types of credit you have received. \\nThe rating agencies give your payment history the most weight, because it indicates your \\nrisk of future defaults. Do you pay your debts? How often have you defaulted in the \\npast? \\nThe credit available to you is reflected in the amounts you currently owe or the credit \\nlimits on your current accounts. These show how dependent you are on credit and \\nwhether or not you are able to take on more credit. Generally, your outstanding credit \\nbalances should be no more than 25 percent of your available credit. \\nThe length of your credit history shows how long you have been using credit \\nsuccessfully; the longer you have been doing so, the less risky a borrower you are, and \\nthe higher your score becomes. Credit rating agencies pay more attention to your more \\nrecent credit history and also look at the age and mix of your credit accounts, which \\nshow your consistency and diversification as a borrower. \\nThe credit rating process is open to manipulation and misinterpretation. Many people \\nare shocked to discover, for example, that simply canceling a credit card, even for a \\ndormant or unused account, lowers their credit rating by shortening their credit history \\nand decreasing the diversity of their accounts. Yet, it may make sense for a responsible \\nborrower to cancel a card. Credit reports may also contain errors that you should correct \\nby disputing the information. '),\n",

(Beware of any other Web sites \\ncalled “annual credit report” as these may be impostors.) It is important to check your \\nscore regularly to check for those errors. Knowing your score can help you to make \\nfinancing decisions because it can help you to determine your potential costs of credit. It \\ncan also alert you to any credit or identity theft of which you otherwise are unaware. \\nIdentity theft is a growing problem. Financial identity theft occurs when someone \\nposes as you based on having personal information such as your Social Security number, \\ndriver’s license number, bank account number, or credit card numbers. The impostor \\nuses your identity to either access your existing accounts (withdrawing funds from your \\nchecking account or buying things with your credit card) or establish new accounts in \\nyour name and use those. \\nThe best protection is to be careful how you give out public information. Convenience \\nencourages more and more transactions by telephone and Internet, but you still need to \\nbe sure of whom you are talking to before giving out identifying data. \\nAs careful as you are, you cannot protect yourself completely. However, checking your \\ncredit report regularly can flag any unfamiliar or unusual activity carried out in your \\nname. If you suspect that your personal information has been breached, you can ask the \\ncredit reporting agencies to issue a fraud alert. Fraud alert messages notify potential \\ncredit grantors to verify your identification by contacting you before extending credit in \\nyour name in case someone is using your information without your consent. That way, if \\na thief is using your credit to establish new accounts (or buy a home, a car, or a boat) \\nyou will know it. If a stronger measure is needed, you can order a credit freeze that will \\nprevent anyone other than yourself from accessing your credit file. \\nUsing a Credit Card \\nCredit cards issued by a bank or financing company are the most common form of \\nrevolving credit. This often has costs only after a repayment deadline has passed. For \\nexample, many credit cards offer a grace period between the time of the credit \\npurchase or “charge” and the time of payment, assuming your beginning balance is zero. \\nIf you pay before interest is applied, you are using someone else’s money to make your \\npurchases at no additional cost. In that case, you are using the credit simply as a cash \\nmanagement tool. \\nCredit cards are effective as a cash management tool. They can be safer to use than cash, \\nespecially for purchasing pricier items. Payment for many items can be consolidated and '),\n",

For \\nexample, you might use one card for personal purchases and another for work-related \\nexpenses. Credit cards also make it convenient to buy on impulse, which may cause \\nproblems. \\nProblems arise if you go beyond using your card as a cash management tool and use it to \\nextend credit or to finance your purchases past the payment deadline. At that point, \\ninterest charges begin to accrue. Typically, that interest is expensive— perhaps only a few \\npercentage points per month, but compounding to a large annual percentage rate (APR). \\nCredit card APRs today may start with 0 percent for introductory offers and range from \\n8.75 percent to more than 20 percent. These rates may be fixed or variable, but in any \\ncase, when you carry a balance from month to month, this high interest is added to what \\nyou owe. \\nAs an example, if your credit card charges interest of 1.5 percent per month, that may \\nnot sound like much, but it is an annual percentage rate of 18 percent (1.5% per month × \\n12 months per year). To put that in perspective, remember that your savings account is \\nprobably earning only around 1 to 3 percent per year. Consumer credit thus is an \\nexpensive way to finance consumption. Consumers tend to rely on their cards when they \\nneed things and lack the cash, and this can quickly lead to credit card debt. \\nAccording to recent surveys, 41 percent of college students have a credit card, and of \\nthose, about 65 percent pay their bills in full every month. This is higher than the \\ngeneral adult population, and fewer than half of U.S. families carry credit card debt.[1]  \\nAmong the 35 percent of college students with credit cards who do not pay their \\nbalances in full every month, the average balance is $452.[2]  \\nChoosing a Credit Card \\nYou should shop around for credit just as you would shop around for anything that you \\nmight purchase with it: compare the features and the costs of each credit card. \\nFeatures of the credit include the credit limit (or how much credit will be extended), the \\ngrace period, purchase guarantees, liability limits, and consumer rewards. Some cards \\noffer a guarantee for purchases; if you purchase a defective item, you can have the \\ncharge “stopped” and removed from your credit card bill. Liability limits involve your \\nresponsibilities should your card be lost or stolen. \\nConsumer rewards may be offered by some credit cards, usually by rewarding “points” \\nfor dollars of credit. The points may then be cashed in for various products. Sometimes \\nthe credit card is sponsored by a certain retailer and offers rewards redeemable only \\nthrough that store. A big sponsor of rewards has been the airline industry, commonly \\noffering “frequent flyer miles” through credit cards as well as actual flying. Be aware, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 173}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  174 \\nhowever, that many rewards offers have limitations or conditions on redemption. In the \\nend, many people never redeem their rewards. \\nCreditors charge fees for extending credit. There is the APR on your actual credit, which \\nmay be a fixed or adjustable rate. It may be adjustable based on the age of your \\nbalance— that is, the rate may rise if your balance is over sixty days or ninety days. There \\nmay also be a late fee charged in addition to the actual interest. The APR may also adjust \\nas your balance increases, so that even if you stay within your credit limit, you are \\npaying a higher rate of interest on a larger balance. \\nThere are also fees on cash advances and on balance transfers (i.e., having other credit \\nbalances transferred to this creditor). These can be higher than the APR and can add a \\nlot to the cost of those services. You should be aware of those costs when making \\nchoices. For example, it can be much cheaper to withdraw cash from an ATM using your \\nbank account’s debit card than using a cash advance from your credit card. \\nMany credit cards charge an annual fee just for having the credit card, regardless of how \\nmuch it is used. Many do not, however, and it is worth looking for a card that offers the \\nfeatures that you want with no annual fee. \\nHow you will use the credit card will determine which features are important to you and \\nwhat costs you will have to pay to get them. If you plan to use the credit card as a cash \\nmanagement tool and pay your balance every month, then you are less concerned with \\nthe APR and more concerned about the annual fee, or the cash advance charges. If you \\nsometimes carry a balance, then you are more concerned with the APR. \\nIt is important to understand the costs and responsibilities of using credit— and it is very \\neasy to overlook them. \\nInstallment Credit \\nRetailers also may offer credit, usually as installment credit for a specific purchase, such \\nas a flat screen TV or baby furniture. The cost of that credit can be hard to determine, as \\nthe deal is usually offered in terms of “low, low monthly payments of only…” or “no \\ninterest for the first six months.” To find the actual interest rate you would have to use \\nthe relationships of time and value. Ideally, you would pay in as few installments as you \\ncould afford and would pay all the installments in the shortest possible time. \\nRetailers usually offer credit for the same reason they offer home delivery— as a sales \\ntool— because most often, customers would be hesitant or even unable to make a \\ndurable goods purchase without the opportunity to buy it over time. For such retailers, \\nthe cost of issuing and collecting credit and its risk are operating costs of sales. The \\ninterest on installment credit offsets those sales costs. Some retailers sell their \\ninstallment receivables to a company that specializes in the management and collection \\nof consumer credit, including the repossession of durable goods. '),\n",

Personal loans \\nused as credit are all-purpose loans that may be “unsecured”— that is, nothing is offered \\nas collateral— or “secured.” Personal loans used as debt financing are discussed in the \\nnext section. Personal loans used as credit are often costly and difficult to secure, \\ndepending on the size of the loan and the bank’s risks and costs (screening and \\npaperwork). \\nA personal loan may also be made by a private financier who holds personal property as \\ncollateral, such as a pawnbroker in a pawnshop. Typically, such loans are costly, usually \\nresult in the loss of the property, and are used by desperate borrowers with no other \\nsources of credit. Today, many “financiers” offer personal loans online at very high \\ninterest rates with no questions asked to consumers with bad credit. This is a \\ncontemporary form of “loan sharking,” or the practice of charging a very high and \\npossibly illegal interest rate on an unsecured personal loan. Some loan sharks have been \\nknown to use threats of harm to collect what is owed. \\nOne form of high-tech loan sharking growing in popularity on the Internet today is the \\n“payday loan,” which offers very short-term small personal loans at high interest rates. \\nThe amount you borrow, usually between $500 and $1,500, is directly deposited into \\nyour checking account overnight, but you must repay the loan with interest on your next \\npayday. The loan thus acts as an advance payment of your wages or salary, so when your \\npaycheck arrives, you have already spent a large portion of it, and maybe even more \\nbecause of the interest you have to pay. As you can imagine, many victims of repeated \\npayday loans fall behind in their payments, cannot meet their fixed living expenses on \\ntime, and end up ever deeper in debt. \\nPersonal loans are the most expensive way to finance recurring expenses, and almost \\nalways create more expense and risk— both financial and personal— for the borrower. \\nCredit Trouble and Protections \\nAs easy as it is to use credit, it is even easier to get into trouble with it. Because of late \\nfees and compounding interest, if you don’t pay your balance in full each month, it \\nquickly multiplies and becomes more difficult to pay. It doesn’t take long for the debt to \\noverwhelm you. \\nIf that should happen to you, the first thing to do is to try to devise a realistic budget that \\nincludes a plan to pay off the balance. Contact your creditors and explain that you are \\nhaving financial difficulties and that you have a plan to make your payments. Don’t wait \\nfor the creditor to turn your account over to a debt collector; be proactive in trying to \\nresolve the debt. If your account has been turned over to a collector, you do have some \\nprotections: the Fair Debt Collection Practices (federal) law keeps a collector from \\ncalling you at work, for example, or after 9 p.m. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  176 \\nYou may want to use a credit counselor to help you create a budget and negotiate with \\ncreditors. Many counseling agencies are nonprofit organizations that can also help with \\ndebt consolidation and debt management. Some “counselors” are little more than \\ncreditors trying to sell you more credit, however, so be careful about checking their \\ncredentials before you agree to any plan. What you need is more realistic credit, not \\nmore credit. \\nAs a last resort, you may file for personal bankruptcy, which may relieve you of some of \\nyour debts, but will blemish your credit rating for ten years, making it very difficult—\\nand expensive— for you to use any kind of credit or debt. Federal bankruptcy laws allow \\nyou to file under Chapter 7 or under Chapter 13. Each allows you to keep some assets, \\nand each holds you to some debts. Chapter 7 requires liquidation of most of your assets, \\nwhile Chapter 13 applies if you have some income. It gets complicated, and you will \\nwant legal assistance, which may be provided by your local Legal Aid Society. The effects \\nof a bankruptcy can last longer than your debts would have, however, so it should never \\nbe seen as an “out” but really as a last resort. \\nModern laws and regulations governing the extension and use of credit and debt try to \\nbalance protection of the lender and of the borrower. They try to insure that credit or \\ndebt is used for economic purposes and not to further social or political goals. They try \\nto balance borrowers’ access to credit and debt as tools of financial management with \\nthe rights of property owners (lenders). \\nIn the United States, federal legislation reflects this balance of concerns. Major federal \\nlegislation in the United States is shown in Figure 7.10 \"Major U.S. Federal Legislation: \\nCredit and Debt\". \\nFigure 7.10 Major U.S. Federal Legislation: Credit and Debt \\n \\nIn addition, many states have their own legislation and oversight.

Before you get into the specifics, however, it is good to know some \\ngeneral ideas about debt. \\nUsually, the asset financed by the debt can serve as collateral for the debt, lowering the \\ndefault risk for the lender. However, that security is often outweighed by the amount \\nand maturity of the loan, so default risk remains a serious concern for lenders. Whatever \\nconcerns lenders will be included in the cost of debt, and so these things should also \\nconcern borrowers. \\nLenders face two kinds of risk: default risk, or the risk of not being paid, and \\ninterest rate risk, or the risk of not being paid enough to outweigh their opportunity \\ncost and make a profit from lending. Your costs of debt will be higher than the lender’s \\ncost of risk. When you lower the lender’s risk, you lower your cost of debt. \\nCosts of Debt \\nDefault Risk \\nLenders are protected against default risk by screening applicants to try to determine \\ntheir probability of defaulting. Along with the scores provided by credit rating agencies, \\nlenders evaluate loan applicants on “the five C’s”: character, capacity, capital, collateral, \\nand conditions. \\nCharacter is an assessment of the borrower’s attitude toward debt and its obligations, \\nwhich is a critical factor in predicting timely repayment. To deduce “character,” lenders \\ncan look at your financial stability, employment history, residential history, and \\nrepayment history on prior loans. \\nCapacity represents your ability to repay by comparing the size of your proposed debt \\nobligations to the size of your income, expenses, and current obligations. The larger \\nyour income is in relation to your obligations, the more likely it is that you are able to \\nmeet those obligations. \\nCapital is your wealth or asset base. You use your income to meet your debt payments, \\nbut you could use your asset base or accumulated wealth as well if your income falls \\nshort. Also, you can use your asset base as collateral. \\nCollateral insures the lender against default risk by claiming a valuable asset in case you \\ndefault. Loans to finance the purchase of assets, such as a mortgage or car loan, \\ncommonly include the asset as collateral— the house or the car. Other loans, such as a \\nstudent loan, may not specify collateral but instead are guaranteed by your general \\nwealth. \\nConditions refer to the lender’s assessment of the current and expected economic \\nconditions that are the context for this loan. If the economy is contracting and \\nunemployment is expected to rise, that may affect your ability to earn income and repay '),\n",

Also, if inflation is expected, the lender can expect that (1) interest rates will \\nrise and (2) the value of the currency will fall. In this case, lenders will want to use a \\nhigher interest rate to protect against interest rate risk and the devaluation of \\nrepayments. \\nInterest Rate Risk \\nBecause debt is long term, the lender is exposed to interest rate risk, or the risk that \\ninterest rates will fluctuate over the maturity of the loan. A loan is issued at the current \\ninterest rate, which is “the going rate” or current equilibrium market price for liquidity. \\nIf the interest rate on the loan is fixed, then that is the lender’s compensation for the \\nopportunity cost or time value of money over the maturity of the loan. \\nIf interest rates increase before the loan matures, lenders suffer an opportunity cost \\nbecause they miss out on the extra earnings that their cash could have earned had it not \\nbeen tied up in a fixed-rate loan. If interest rates fall, borrowers will try to refinance or \\nborrow at lower rates to pay off this now higher-rate loan. Then the lender will have its \\nliquidity back, but it can only be re-lent at a newer, lower price and create earnings at \\nthis new, lower rate. So the lender suffers the opportunity cost of the interest that could \\nhave been earned. \\nWhy should you, the borrower, care? Because lenders will have you cover their costs and \\ncreate a loan structured to protect them from these sorts of risks. Understanding their \\nrisks (looking at the loan agreement from their point of view) helps you to understand \\nyour debt choices and to use them to your advantage. \\nLenders can protect themselves against interest rate risk by structuring loans with a \\npenalty for early repayment to discourage refinancing or by offering a floating-\\nrate loanA loan for which the interest rate can change, usually periodically and relative \\nto a benchmark rate such as the prime rate. instead of a fixed rate-loan. With a \\nfloating-rate loan, the interest rate “floats” or changes, usually relative to a benchmark \\nsuch as the prime rate, which is the rate that banks charge their very best (least risky) \\nborrowers. The floating-rate loan shifts some interest rate risk onto the borrower, for \\nwhom the cost of debt would rise as interest rates rise. The borrower would still benefit, \\nand the lender would still suffer from a fall in interest rates, but there is less probability \\nof early payoff should interest rates fall. Mainly, the floating-rate loan is used to give the \\nlender some benefit should interest rates rise.

The better or more creditworthy a borrower you are, \\nthe better the terms and structure of the loan you may negotiate. \\nUses of Debt \\nDebt should be used to finance assets rather than recurring expenses, which are better \\nmanaged with a combination of cash and credit. The maturity of the financing (credit or \\ndebt) should match the useful life of the purchase. In other words, you should use \\nshorter-term credit for consumption and longer-term debt for assets. \\nIf you finance consumption with longer-term debt, then your debt will outlive your \\nexpenses; you will be continuing to pay for something long after it is gone. If you finance \\nassets with short-term debt, you will be making very high payments, both because you \\nwill be repaying over a shorter time and so will have fewer periods in which to repay and \\nbecause your cost of credit is usually higher than your cost of debt, for example, annual \\ncredit card rates are typically higher than mortgage rates. \\nBorrowers may be tempted to finance asset purchases with credit, however, to avoid the \\nmore difficult screening process of debt. Given the more significant investment of time \\nand money in debt, lenders screen potential borrowers more rigorously for debt than \\nthey do for credit. The transaction costs for borrowing with debt are therefore higher \\nthan they are for borrowing with credit. Still, the higher costs of credit should be a \\ncaution to borrowers. \\nThe main reason not to finance expenses with debt is that expenses are expected to \\nrecur, and therefore the best way to pay for them is with a recurring source of financing, \\nsuch as income. The cost of credit can be minimized if it is used merely as a cash \\nmanagement tool, but if it is used as debt, if interest costs are allowed to accrue, then it \\nbecomes a very costly form of financing, because it creates new expense (interest) and \\nfurther obligates future income. In turn, that limits future choices, creating even more \\nopportunity cost. \\n'),\n",

Analyze financing choices and discuss their impact on purchasing decisions.  \\n5. Discuss the advantages of consumer strategies using branding, timing, and transaction costs.  \\n6. Identify common consumer scams, strategies, and remedies. \\nConsumer purchases refer to items used in daily living (e.g., clothing, food, electronics, \\nappliances). They are the purchases that most intimately frame your life: you live with \\nthese items and use them every day. They are an expression and a reflection of you, your \\ntastes, and your lifestyle choices. Your spending decisions reflect your priorities. Maybe \\nyou take pride in your car or your clothes or your kitchen appliances or your latest, \\ncoolest whatever. Or maybe you spend whatever you can on travel or on your passion for \\nhiking. Those very personal tastes will frame your spending choices. \\nConsumer purchases should fit into your budget. By making an operating budget, you \\ncan plan to consume and to finance your consumption without creating extra costs of \\nborrowing. You can plan to live within your income. At times, you may have unexpected \\nchanges (loss of a job or change in the family) that put your nondiscretionary needs \\ntemporarily beyond your means. Ideally, you would want to have a cushion to tide you \\nover until you can adjust your spending to fit your income. \\nA budget can also show you just how fast some “small luxuries” can add up. Stopping for \\na latte on your way to work or school every day ($3.95) adds up to $20 per week, or \\nabout $1,000 per year. That money may be better used to finance a bigger ticket item \\nthat you then would not have to finance with debt. With the budget to help you put \\nexpenses into perspective, you can make better purchasing decisions. \\nPurchasing decisions are always limited by the income available, and that means making \\nchoices. Your choices of what, where, when, and even how to buy will affect the amount \\nthat you spend and the utility (the joy or regret) that you ultimately get out of your \\npurchase. \\nShopping is a process. You decide what you want, then have to make more specific \\ndecisions: \\n• Should you buy more (and pay more) but get a cheaper unit price? \\n• Should you buy locally or remotely, via catalogue or Internet? \\n• Should you pay more for a well-known brand, or buy the generic? \\n• Should you look for a guarantee or warranty or consider long-term repair costs? \\n• Should you consider resale value? \\n• Should you pay cash or use credit? If you pay through credit, is it store credit, \\nyour own credit card, or a loan? \\nEach of these decisions creates a trade-off. For example, it may be more convenient—\\nand quicker— to shop locally, but there may be lower prices and a better selection of \\nproducts online. Or you may find lower prices online but have a harder time getting \\nrepairs done if you haven’t bought locally. '),\n",

Other purchases involve more decisions \\nbecause they are made less often and involve costlier items such as a car. When you have \\nto live with your decision for years instead of days, you tend to make it more carefully. \\nThe decision process can be broken down into the following steps: \\n• Before you buy or “prepurchase,” \\no identify the product: compare attributes; \\no identify the market: compare price, delivery (return), convenience; \\no identify the financing. \\n• As you buy, \\no negotiate attributes: color, delivery, style; \\no negotiate price and purchase costs; \\no negotiate payment. \\n• After you buy, or “postpurchase,” consider \\no maintenance; \\no how to address dissatisfaction. \\nBefore You Buy: Identify the Product \\nWhat do you want? What do you want it to do for you? What do you want to gain by \\nhaving it or using it or wearing it or eating it or playing with it or…? You buy things \\nhoping to solve a need in your life. The more specifically you can define that need, the \\nmore accurately you can identify something to fill it. If your purchase is inappropriate \\nfor your need, you will not be happy with it, no matter how good it is. And because your \\nbudget is limited, you want to minimize your opportunity cost and buyer’s remorse or \\nregret at not making a better purchase in order to use your limited income most \\nefficiently. \\nSometimes you can identify a need, but have no idea of the kinds of products that may \\nfill it. This is especially true for infrequent needs or purchases. For example, you may \\ndecide you need to get away and take a long weekend. To do it cheaply, you decide to go \\nhiking and camping. To make it more fun, you decide to go to an area where you’ve \\nnever been before. You may not be aware of the camping options available in that area, \\nhowever, or of equally cheap alternatives such as hostels, bed and breakfasts, or other \\naccommodations. When you find that you have a range of choices, you can compare \\nthem and choose one that offers the most satisfaction. \\nOnce you have identified the product, you can compare the attributes of those products. \\nWhat characteristics do you require or want? How are you going to use the product? For \\nexample, do you need cooking facilities, access to a shower, a safe but scenic location, \\nopportunities to meet other hikers, and so on? What attributes are important to you and \\nwhat are available? '),\n",

Sig begins to research keyboards and finds over \\nfive hundred models from over fifty brands with different designs, attributes, and \\nfunctions offered at a range of prices. He decides to try to filter his choices by looking \\nonly at gaming keyboards, which narrows it down to about eighty models. \\nNoticing that most of the keyboards range in price from twenty-five to fifty dollars, he \\ndecides to look in the fifty to a hundred dollar range, figuring he’ll get a slightly higher-\\nend product, but not an outrageously expensive one. This narrows his search to about \\ntwenty-five models. \\nNone of the models has all the attributes that Sig desires. It’s a trade-off: he can have \\nsome features, but not others. He decides to try to organize his research by creating a \\ntable ranking the product attributes in order of importance, and then scoring each \\nmodel on each attribute (on a scale of one to ten), eventually coming up with an overall \\nscore for each model.

If the market is not very liquid, then the transaction costs of selling in the used \\nproduct market may be significant, and you may be disappointed with the result. \\nThe more choices you have, the better your chances of finding satisfaction. The more \\nproducts there are to satisfy your need, and the more attributes those products offer, the \\nmore likely you are to find what “works” for you. Sometimes you need to be a bit creative \\nin thinking about your alternatives, especially with limited resources. \\nSources of product information include the manufacturer, retailer, and other \\nconsumers. Certain information must be provided for certain products by law. For \\nexample, food ingredients must be labeled, and perishable products dated. Appliances \\nalmost always come with operating and care instructions that can give you an idea of \\ntheir ongoing maintenance costs as well as operating features. \\nThe Internet has made it easy to research products online and to become a much better \\ninformed consumer. You can do lots of research online, even if you actually purchase \\nlocally. A feature of many online stores and consumer discussions is product reviews, \\nwhere consumers give feedback on their satisfaction with the product. Such reviews can \\nbalance the information from the manufacturer and retailer, who want to inform \\nconsumers to encourage them to buy. \\nOther sources of information are magazines and trade journals (such as Consumer \\nReports, both in print and online), which have articles and ratings on products as well \\nas ads. Your research may also involve actual or virtual window shopping, like going to \\nstores to examine the products you are thinking of buying. \\nBefore You Buy: Identify the Market \\nYour market may be local, national, or international, with advantages and disadvantages \\nto each. Generally, a larger market (more vendors) will offer more variation and \\nselection of product attributes. \\nAs with any market, the real determinant of how your market works is competition. The \\nmore vendors there are, the more they compete for your business, and the more likely \\nyou will find options for purchasing convenience, product attributes, and price. \\nIn markets where vendors are so plentiful that your problem is filtering rather than \\nfinding information, there are middlemen to provide that service. An example is the \\nbudget travel businesses with Web sites that make it convenient to research and buy \\nflights, rental cars, and hotel accommodations. Middlemen or brokers exist in markets \\nwhere they can add value to your purchasing process, either by providing information in \\nthe prepurchase stage or by providing convenience during the purchase. The more they \\ncan reduce the cost of a “bad” decision (e.g., a difficult flight schedule, an expensive car \\nrental, an uncomfortable hotel accommodation), the more valuable they are. They can \\nadd more value in markets where you have too little or too much information or less '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 188}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  189 \\nfamiliarity with products or vendors. Generally, the more expensive the product or the \\nless frequent the purchase, the more likely you will find a middleman to make it easier. \\nSome products have a “new” and a “used” market, such as durable goods and some \\nconsumer goods like textbooks, vintage clothing, and yard sale goods. Evaluating the \\nquality of a used or preowned product can require more research, information, and \\nexpertise, because the effect of its past use on its future value can be hard to estimate. \\nUsed products are almost always priced less than new products, unless they have \\nbecome “collectibles” that can store value. The trade-off is that used products offer less \\nreliable or predictable future performance and may lack attributes of newer models. \\nDifferent kinds of stores often offer the same products at different prices. Convenience \\nstores, for example, typically charge higher prices than grocery stores but may be in \\nmore convenient locations and open at more convenient hours. Smaller boutique stores \\ncannot always realize the economies of scale in administrative costs or in inventory \\nmanagement that are available to a larger store or a chain of stores. For those reasons \\nprices tend to be higher at a smaller store. Boutiques often offer more amenities and a \\nhigher level of customer service to be competitive. You may also shop at a specialty store \\nwhen you need a certain level of expertise or assistance in making a purchase. \\nCooperative stores are owned and managed collectively and may provide goods or \\nservices that would not otherwise be available. Shopping is usually open to anyone, but \\nmembers are eligible for discounts, depending on their participation in the store’s \\noperations or management. The members own the store, so they can forgo corporate \\nprofits for consumer discounts. \\nIncreasingly, merchandise of all kinds may be bought directly from the manufacturer, \\noften through a catalogue or online. The shopping experience is very different (you can’t \\ntry on the sweater or see how the keyboard feels), but if you are well informed about the \\nproduct, you may be comfortable buying it. Internet shopping has become a great \\nconvenience to those who are too busy or too far away to visit stores. \\nAuctions are becoming increasingly popular, especially online auctions at eBay and \\nsimilar sites. Auctions are open negotiations between buyers and sellers and offer \\ndynamic pricing. They also offer uncertainty, as the price and even the eventual \\npurchase are risky— you may lose the auction and not get the item. Auctions are used \\nmost often for resales and for assets such as homes, cars, antiques, art, and collectibles. \\nThe popularity of online auctions has led to more buyers, bringing more competition \\nand thus higher prices. \\nBefore You Buy: Identify the Financing \\nMost consumer purchases are for consumable goods or services and are budgeted from \\ncurrent income. You pay by using cash or a debit card or, if financed, by using a credit \\ncard for short-term financing. Such purchases— food, clothing, transportation, and so \\non— should be covered by recurring income because they are recurring expenses. You '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 189}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  190 \\nneed to be able to afford them. As you read in Chapter 7 \"Financial Management\", \\nconsumers who use debt to finance consumption can quickly run into trouble because \\nthey add the cost of debt to their recurring expenses, which are already greater than \\ntheir recurring income. \\nUnless financed by savings, durable goods such as appliances, household wares, or \\nelectronics are often bought on credit, as they are costlier items infrequently purchased. \\nAssets such as a car or a home may be financed using long-term debt such as a car loan \\nor a mortgage, although they also require some down payment of cash. \\nThe use of middlemen or brokers to find and buy an item also contributes to the cost of \\na purchase because of the fees you pay for the service. \\nProducts and preferred financing sources are shown in Figure 8.5 \"Products and \\nPreferred Financing Sources\". \\nFigure 8.5 Products and Preferred Financing Sources \\n \\nAs You Buy: The Purchase \\nHaving done your homework and made your choice, you are ready to purchase. In some \\ncases, you may be able to make specific arrangements with vendors as to convenience, \\nprice, delivery, and even financing. \\nIn Western cultures, prices for consumer goods are usually not negotiable; consumers \\nexpect to pay the price on the price tag. In other cultures, however, haggling over price is \\ncommon and expected, which often surprises travelers abroad. \\nDurable goods and asset purchases typically offer more purchase options than consumer \\ngoods, usually as an incentive to buyers. Vendors may offer free delivery or free \\ninstallation, product guarantees, or financing arrangements such as “no payments for \\nsix months” or “zero percent financing.” Offers may be enhanced periodically to “move \\nthe merchandise,” when prices may also be discounted. Sales, “special offers” or “low, \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 190}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  191 \\nlow prices” may be used to sell merchandise that is about to be replaced by a newer \\nmodel. If those product cycles are seasonal and predictable, you may be able to schedule \\nyour purchase to take advantage of discounts. \\nOr you may decide to wait and pay full price for the newer model to avoid purchasing a \\nproduct that is about to become outdated. \\nThe more the purchase process allows for negotiation, the more possibility there is for \\nconsumers to enhance satisfaction. However, the negotiation process can go the other \\nway too: it allows more opportunity for the vendor to negotiate an advantage. The \\nbetter-informed consumer is more likely to negotiate a more satisfying purchase, so it is \\nimportant to be thorough in the prepurchase research. \\nA purchase may have transaction costs such as sales tax or delivery charges. For higher-\\npriced products such as durables and assets, those transaction costs can add up, so you \\nshould figure them into your overall cost of the purchase. \\nFinancing costs can also be significant if debt financing is used. Debt is long term and is \\na significant commitment as well. It may pay to compare financing rates and terms just \\nas you would for the product itself, or you may be able to use financing costs as a \\nnegotiating chip in your price negotiations. \\nAfter You Buy \\nNow you can enjoy your purchase. Some products require maintenance and periodic \\nrepair to remain useful. You should research those additional costs before buying, \\nbecause after the purchase you are committed to those activities. \\nIf you are not satisfied due to a product defect, you can contact the retailer or \\nmanufacturer. If there is a warranty, the retailer or manufacturer will either fix the \\ndefect or replace the item. Many manufacturers and retailers will do so even if there is \\nno warranty to maintain good customer relations and enhance their brand’s reputation. \\nAn Internet search will usually turn up contact information for a product’s customer \\nservice team. \\nThere are also federal and state consumer protection laws that cover a seller’s \\nresponsibilities after a sale. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \\nBureau of Consumer Protection has the most direct responsibility for consumer issues. \\nAt the state level, the office of the attorney general usually has a consumer protection \\ndivision. Locally, you can also contact your chamber of commerce or Better Business \\nBureau (BBB) for more information. \\nYou can also resort to the judicial system for compensation. For limited claims, you can \\nfile in small claims court. Claim limits vary by state, but range between $500 and \\n$10,000. Small claims court is a less formal and costly process than filing a suit. At the '),\n",

In 2007, the top 100 biggest advertisers spent \\n$107,635,000,000 on advertising worldwide, with the automotive, personal care, and \\nfood industries leading the pack.[1]  \\nProducers go to great expense to brand their products. When in doubt, consumers tend \\nto choose a familiar brand. Once disappointed by a brand, consumers tend to avoid it. \\nFor some products, there are alternative private-label or store-label brands, applied to \\nmany products but sold by one store or chain. The store brand is usually a cheaper \\nalternative and often, although not always, of comparable quality. This is a widespread \\npractice in the food industry with grocery store brands. Shopping for the store brand can \\noften yield significant savings. \\nAiden’s purchase comes with a two-year manufacturer’s guarantee, but the salesperson \\nis encouraging her to buy an extended warranty. She is already paying more than she \\nwanted to for a high-quality machine, and the extended warranty adds nearly a hundred \\ndollars to the purchase price. She decides to forgo the extra protection, reasoning that \\nmost repairs, if needed after two years, would cost less than that anyway. \\nAn offer of a warranty with purchase can be valuable if it lowers the expected \\nmaintenance or repair costs of the product. Sometimes a product is offered with a \\nwarranty at a higher price; sometimes you can purchase an optional warranty for an \\nadditional cost. If the cost of a malfunction is low, then the warranty is probably not \\nworth it. \\nPrice advantage can sometimes come through timing. Seasonally updated products or \\nmodels can force retailers to discount old inventory to get it off the shelves before the \\nnew inventory arrives. Automobiles, for example, have a one-year product cycle, as do \\nmany desktop computers and peripherals. \\nSome products are naturally dated, such as calendars or tax preparation software, and \\nso may be discounted as they near their expiration date. However, that is because they \\nhave less and less usefulness and may not be worth buying at all. \\nCommodities prices can fluctuate depending on the season or the weather, and although \\nyou may not have a choice of buying home heating oil when you do, some products do \\noffer you a choice. Tomatoes in January are more expensive than in August, for \\nexample; eating fresh foods seasonally can produce savings. \\nPrice can also be affected by transaction costs, or the costs of making the purchase. They \\ncan be included in the price or may be listed separately. Larger and more expensive '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 192}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  193 \\nitems tend to have more transaction costs such as delivery and storage. Sales tax, which \\nis a percentage of the price, may be required, and the higher the item’s price, the more \\nsales tax you will pay. Asset purchases also involve a legal transfer of ownership and \\noften the costs of acquiring financing, which add to their costs. Sometimes, to entice a \\npurchase, the seller may agree to bear some or all of the transaction costs. \\nRetailers change prices based on buyers’ needs. They practice price discrimination, \\nor the practice of charging a different price for the same product, when different \\nconsumers have different need of a product. Airlines are a classic example, charging less \\nfor a ticket bought weeks in advance than for the same flight if the ticket is bought the \\nday before. Someone who purchases weeks ahead is probably a leisure traveler, has \\nmore flexibility, and is more sensitive to price. Someone who books a day ahead is \\nprobably a business traveler, has little flexibility, and is not so sensitive to price. The \\nbusiness traveler, in this case, is willing to pay more, so the airline will charge that \\nperson more. \\nRetailers also offer discounts, sales, or “deals” to attract consumers who otherwise \\nwould not be shopping. Sometimes these are seasonal and predictable, such as in \\nJanuary, when sales follow the big holiday shopping season. Sometimes sales are not \\nsales at all, but prices are “discounted” relative to new, higher, prices that will soon take \\neffect. Quantity discounts, a lower unit price for a higher volume purchased, may be \\navailable for customers buying larger quantities, although sometimes the opposite is \\ntrue, that is, the smaller package offers a smaller unit price. While it may be cheaper to \\nbuy a year’s worth of toilet paper at one time, you then create storage costs and sacrifice \\nliquidity, which you should weigh against your cost savings. \\nIn short, sellers want to sell and will use price to make products more attractive. As a \\nbuyer, you need to recognize when that attraction offers real value. \\nScams: Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware) \\nUnfortunately the world of commerce includes people with less-than-honorable \\nintentions. You likely have been taken advantage of once or twice or have fallen victim to \\na scam, or a fraudulent business activity or swindle. Technology has made it easier for \\ncon artists to steal from more people, contacting them by telephone or by e-mail. The \\ndetails of the scam vary, but the pattern is much the same: the fraud sets up a scenario \\nthat requires the victim to send money or to divulge financial or personal information, \\nsuch as bank account, Social Security (federal ID), or credit card numbers, which can \\nthen be used to access accounts. \\nHere are some typical scams reported by Consumer Reports, the magazine of the \\nnonprofit Consumers Union, an advocacy group for consumers:[2]  \\n• This car’s a cream puff. \\n• You’ve just won.… \\n• There’s a problem with your bank account. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 193}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  194 \\n• This stock is at 50 cents, and it’s going to 5 or 6 bucks this week. Buy now! \\n• You don’t need a physical to qualify for this low-cost health insurance! \\n• I’ll be back sometime soon to finish your roof. \\n• This investment provides the guaranteed high returns and low risk that seniors \\nlike you need. \\n• We move u 4 less. \\n• I’m a political refugee. Help me move millions out of my former country into your \\nbank account. \\n• I wouldn’t go on vacation without this car repair. \\nThe best way to protect yourself from scams is to be as informed as possible. Do your \\nhomework. If you feel like you are in over your head, call on a friend or family member \\nto help you or to speak for you in negotiations. There are a number of nonprofit and \\ngovernment agencies that you can ask about the legitimacy of an idea or an \\narrangement. There are also some proven ways to try to protect yourself: \\n• Never give anyone personal and/or financial information when solicited by \\ntelephone or Internet. Legitimate business interests do not do that. When in \\ndoubt, contact the organization to verify their identity. \\n• Get a second opinion, especially when advised to do costly repairs. \\n• Check the credentials of prospective workers or service providers; most are \\ncertified, licensed, or recognized by a professional organization or trade group \\n(e.g., auto mechanics may be endorsed by the American Automobile Association \\n[AAA]). \\n• If you have doubts about a professional’s credentials, such as an accountant, \\ndoctor, or architect, call the local professional society or trade group and ask \\nabout previous complaints lodged against him or her. \\n• Get a written estimate, specifying the work to be done, the materials to be used, \\nthe estimated labor costs, the estimated completion date, and the estimated total \\nprice. Ask the vendor to provide proof of insurance. \\nIf you do get “scammed,” it is your civic duty to complain to your state’s consumer \\ndivision in the attorney general’s office and, if advised, to federal regulators at the \\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC). That is the only way to stop and expose such frauds \\nand to keep others from becoming victims. As the saying goes, “If it sounds too good to \\nbe true, it probably is.” \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The consumer purchase process involves \\no Prepurchase \\no Identifying the product \\no Identifying the market \\no Identifying the financing '),\n",

A car is not only a significant purchase, but also an ongoing \\ncommitment. \\nIn the United States, people spend a considerable amount of time in their cars, \\ncommuting to work, driving their children to school and various activities, driving to \\nentertainment and recreational activities, and so on. Most people want their car to \\nprovide not only transportation, but also comforts and conveniences. You can apply the \\npurchasing model, described in this chapter, to the car purchase. \\nFirst, you identify the need: What is your goal in owning a car? What needs will it fulfill? \\nHere are some further questions to consider: \\n• What kind of driving will you use the car for? Will you depend on it to get you to \\nwork, or will you use it primarily for weekend getaways? \\n• Do you need carrying capacity (for passengers or “stuff”) or hauling capacity? \\n• Do you live in a metropolitan area where you will be driving shorter distances at \\nlower speeds and often idling in traffic? \\n• Do you live in a more rural area where you will be driving longer distances at \\nfaster speeds? \\n• Do you live in a climate where winter or a rainy season would make traction and \\nstorage an issue? \\n• How much time will you spend in the car every day? \\n• How many miles will you drive each year? \\n• How long do you expect to keep the car? \\n• Do you expect to resell or trade in the car? \\nYour answers to these questions will help you identify the product you want. \\nIdentify the Product '),\n",

Cars have many features to compare. The most critical (in no \\nparticular order) are shown in Figure 8.9 \"Automobile Attributes and Relevance\". \\nFigure 8.9 Automobile Attributes and Relevance \\n \\nAll these attributes affect price, and you may think of others. Product attribution scoring \\ncan help you identify the models that most closely fit your goals. \\nMary lives on a dirt road in a rural area; she drives about 18,000 miles per year, \\ncommuting to her job as an accountant at the corporate headquarters of an auto parts \\nchain and taking her kids to school. She is also a pretty good car mechanic and does \\nbasic maintenance herself. \\nJohn lives in the city; he walks or takes a bus to his job as a market researcher for an ad \\nagency, but keeps a car to visit his parents in the suburbs. He drives about 5,000 miles \\nper year, often crawling in traffic. All John knows about a car is that the key goes in the \\nignition and the fuel goes in the tank. \\nJohn and Mary would rate these attributes very differently, and their scoring of the \\nsame models would have very different results. \\nMary may value fuel efficiency more, as she drives more (and so purchases more fuel). \\nDriving often and with her children, she may rank size, safety, and entertainment \\n'),\n",

Mary relies \\non the car to get to work, so reliability would be more important for her than for John, \\nwho drives only for recreational visits. But Mary also knows that she can maintain and \\nrepair some things herself, which makes that less of a factor. \\nCar attributes are widely publicized by car dealers and manufacturers, who are among \\nthe top advertisers globally year after year.[1]  \\nYou can visit dealerships in your area or manufacturers’ Web sites. Using the Internet is \\na more efficient way of narrowing your search. Specialized print and online magazines, \\nsuch as Car and Driver, Road and Track, and Edmunds.com, offer detailed discussions \\nof model attributes and their actual performance. Consumer Reports also offers ratings \\nand reviews and also provides data on frequency of repairs and annual maintenance \\ncosts. \\nYou want to be sure to consider not only the price of buying the car, but also the costs of \\noperating it. Fuel, maintenance, repair, insurance, property taxes, and registration may \\nall be affected by the car’s attributes, so you should consider operating costs when \\nchoosing the product. For example, routine repairs and maintenance are more \\nexpensive for some cars. A more fuel-efficient car can significantly lower your fuel costs. \\nA more valuable car will cost more to insure and will mean higher property (or excise) \\ntaxes. Moreover, the costs of fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration, and perhaps \\nproperty tax on the car will be ongoing expenses— you want to buy a car you can afford \\nand afford to drive. \\nIf you are buying a new car, you know its condition, and so you can predict annual \\nmaintenance and repair costs and the car’s longevity by the history for that model. \\nDepending on how long you expect to own the car, you may also be concerned with its \\npredicted resale value. \\nUsed cars are generally less expensive than new. A used car has fewer miles left in it. Its \\ncondition is less certain: you may not know how it has been driven or its repair and \\nmaintenance history. This makes it harder to predict annual maintenance and repair \\ncosts. Typically, since it is already used when you buy it, you expect little or no resale \\nvalue. You can gain a significant price savings in the used car market, and there are good \\nused cars for sale. You may just have to look a bit harder to find one. \\nThe National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) offers a checklist for used vehicle \\ninspection when buying a used car. The NADA also publishes guidebooks on used car \\nbook values (see http://www.nadaguides.com). Items to inspect in your exterior, \\ninterior, and engine checks are outlined in Figure 8.10 \"Used Car Buyer’s Checklist\". \\nFigure 8.10 Used Car Buyer’s Checklist[2]  '),\n",

All these events affect your \\nexpectations of the vehicle’s longevity, maintenance and repair costs, resale value, and \\noperating costs, which can help you calculate its value and usefulness. \\nUnless you are an expert yourself, you should always have a trained mechanic inspect a \\nused vehicle before you buy it. With cars, as with any item, the better informed you are, \\nthe better you can do as a consumer. Given the cost of a car and its annual expense, \\nthere is enough at stake with this purchase to make you cautious. \\nIdentify the Market \\nNew cars are sold through car dealerships. The dealer has a contract with the \\nmanufacturer to sell its cars in the retail market. Dealers may also offer repair and \\nmaintenance services as well as parts and accessories made especially for the models it \\nsells. \\nNew car dealers may also resell cars that they get as trade-ins, especially of the same \\nmodels they sell new. Used car dealers typically buy cars through auctions of corporate, \\nrental, or government cars. \\nIndividuals selling a used car can also do so through networking— in an online auction \\nsuch as eBay, a virtual bulletin board such as Craig’s List, or the bulletin board in the \\nlocal college snack bar. Dealers will have more information about the market, especially \\nabout the supply of cars and price levels for them. \\nSome people prefer a new car, with its more advanced features and more certain quality, \\nbut a used car may be a viable substitute for many purchasers. Many people buy used \\ncars while their incomes are lower, especially in the earlier stages of their adult \\n'),\n",

As income rises and concern for convenience, reliability, and safety \\nincreases with age and family size, consumers may move into the new car market. \\nWhile they are two very different markets, the markets for new and used cars are \\nrelated. Supply of and demand for new cars affect price levels in the new car market, but \\nalso in the used car market. For example, when new car prices are high, more buyers \\nseek out used cars and when low, used car buyers may turn to the new car market. \\nDemand for cars is affected by macroeconomic factors such as business cycles and \\ninflation. If there is a recession and a rise in unemployment, incomes drop. Demand for \\nnew cars will fall. Many people will decide to keep driving their current vehicle until \\nthings pick up, unwilling to purchase a long-term asset when they are uncertain about \\ntheir job and paycheck. That slowing of demand may lower car prices, but will also lower \\nthe resale or trade-in value of the current vehicle. For first-time car buyers, that may be \\na good time to buy. \\nIf there is inflation, it will push up interest rates because the price of borrowing money \\nrises with other prices. Since many people borrow when purchasing a car, that will make \\nthe borrowing, and so the purchase, more costly, which will discourage demand. \\nWhen the economy is expanding, on the other hand, and inflation and interest rates are \\nlow, demand for new cars rises, pushing up prices. In turn, prices are kept in check by \\ncompetition. As demand for new cars rises, demand for used cars may fall, causing the \\nsupply of used cars to rise as more people trade in their cars to buy a new one. They \\ntrade them in earlier in the car’s life, so the quality of the used cars on the market rises. \\nThis may be a good time to buy a used car. \\nIdentify the Financing: Loans and Leases \\nThe cost of a car is significant. Car purchases usually require financing through a loan or \\na lease. Each may require a down payment, which you would take out of your savings. \\nThat creates an opportunity cost of losing the return you could have earned on your \\nsavings. You also lose liquidity: you are taking cash, a liquid asset, and trading it for a \\ncar, a not-so-liquid asset. \\nYour opportunity cost and the cost of decreasing your liquidity are costs of buying the \\ncar. You can reduce those costs by borrowing more (and putting less money down), but \\nthe more you borrow, the higher your costs of borrowing. If you trade in a vehicle, \\ndealers will often use the trade-in value as the down payment and will sell the car to you \\nwith “no money down.” \\nCar loans are available from banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, and the \\nmanufacturers themselves. Be sure to shop around for the best deal, as rates, maturity, \\nand terms can vary. If you shop for the loan before shopping for the car, then the loan \\nnegotiation is separate from the car purchase negotiation. Both may be complex deals, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 201}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  202 \\nand there are many trade-offs to be made. The more separate— and simplified— each \\nnegotiation is, the more likely you will be happy with the outcome. \\nLoans differ by interest rate or annual percentage rate (APR) and by the time to \\nmaturity. Both will affect your monthly payments. A loan with a higher APR is costing \\nyou more and, all things being equal, will have a higher monthly payment. A loan with a \\nlonger maturity will reduce your monthly payment, but if the APR is higher, it is actually \\ncosting you more. Loan maturities may range from one to five years; the longer the loan, \\nthe more you risk ending up with a loan that’s worth more than your car. \\nRebecca buys a used Saturn for $6,000, with $1,000 cash down from savings and a \\nGMAC-financed loan at 7.2 APR, on which she pays $115 a month for forty-eight \\nmonths. She could have gotten a twenty-four-month loan, but wanted to have smaller \\nmonthly payments. After only twenty-five months, she totals her car in a chain collision \\nbut luckily escapes injury. Now she needs another car. The Saturn has no trade-in value, \\nher insurance benefit won’t be enough to cover the cost of another car, and she still has \\nto pay off her loan regardless. Rebecca is out of luck, because her debt outlived her asset. \\nIf your debt outlives your asset, your ability to get financing when you go to replace that \\nvehicle will be limited, because you still have the old debt to pay off and now are looking \\nto add a new debt— and its payments— to your budget. Rebecca will have to use more \\nsavings and may have to pay more for a second loan, if she can get one, increasing her \\nmonthly payments or extending her debt over a longer period of time. \\nAn alternative to getting a car loan is leasing a car. Leases are a common way of \\nfinancing a car purchase. A lease is a long-term rental agreement with a \\nbuyout option at maturity. Typically, at the end of the lease, usually three or four \\nyears, you can buy the car outright for a certain amount, or you can give it back (and buy \\nor lease another car), which removes the risk of having an asset that outlives its \\nfinancing. Leases specify an annual mileage limit, that is, the number of miles that you \\ncan drive the car in a year before incurring additional costs. Leases also specify the \\nmonthly payment and requirements for routine maintenance that will preserve the car’s \\nvalue. \\nSo, lease or borrow? The price of the car should be the same regardless of how it is \\nfinanced— the car should be worth what it’s worth, no matter how it is paid for. The cost \\nof borrowing, in percentage terms, is the interest rate or APR of the loan. The costs of \\nleasing, in dollars, are the down payment, the lease payments, and the buyout. Since the \\nprice of the car itself is the same in either case, the present value of all the lease costs \\nshould be the same as the price of the car. You can use what you know about the time \\nvalue of money to calculate the discount rate that produces that price; that is the \\nequivalent annual cost of the lease, in percentage terms. \\nFor example, you want to buy a car with a price of $19,000. You can get a car loan with \\nan APR of 6.5 percent from your bank. You are offered a lease requiring a down \\npayment of $2,999, monthly payments of $359 for three years, and a final buyout of \\n$5,000. The APR of the lease is actually 5.93 percent, which would make it the cheaper \\nfinancing alternative. '),\n",

If you \\ntypically drive a car “into the ground,” until it costs more to repair than replace it, then \\nyou are better off borrowing and spreading the costs of financing over a longer period. \\nOn the other hand, if you intend to keep the car only for the term of the lease and not to \\nexercise the buyout option, then it is usually more cost effective to lease. You also need \\nto consider whether or not you are likely to stay within the mileage limits of the lease, as \\nthe mileage penalties can add significantly to your costs. \\nSome people will say that they like to borrow and then “own” in order to have an asset \\nthat can store value or “build equity.” Given the unpredictable nature of the used car \\nmarket, however, a car is really not an asset that can be counted on to store value. \\nThinking of a car as something that you will use up (although over several years) rather \\nthan as an asset you can preserve or save will help you make better financial decisions. \\nWhen you are buying a car, you want to minimize the cost of both the car and the \\nfinancing. If you are purchasing both the car and the financing from the same dealer, \\nyou should be careful to discuss them separately. Car dealers, who offer loans and leases \\nas well as cars, often combine the three discussions, offering a break on the financing to \\nmake the car more affordable, or offering a break on the car to make the financing more \\naffordable. To complicate matters further, they may also offer a rebate on a certain \\nmodel or with a certain lease. The more clearly you can separate which costs belongs to \\nwhich— the car or the financing— the more clearly you can understand and minimize \\nyour costs. \\nPurchase and Postpurchase \\nA car purchase requires significant prepurchase activities. Once you have identified and \\ncompared appropriate car attributes, a seller, and financing options, all you have to do is \\ndrive away, right? Not quite. \\nCar purchases are one instance where the buyer is expected to haggle over price. The \\nsticker price is the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for that vehicle \\nmodel with those features. Dealers negotiate many of the factors that ultimately \\ndetermine the value of the purchase: the optional features of the car, the warranty \\nterms, service discounts on routine maintenance, financing terms, rebates, trade-in \\nvalue for you old car, and so on. \\nAs more of these factors are discussed at once, the negotiation becomes more and more \\ncomplex. You can help yourself by keeping the negotiations as simple as possible: \\nnegotiate one thing at a time, settle on that, and then negotiate the next factor. Keep \\ntrack of what has been agreed to as you go along. When each factor has been negotiated, \\nyou will have the package deal. \\nYour ability to get a satisfying deal rests on your abilities as a negotiator. For this reason, \\nmany people who find that process distasteful or suspect that their skills are lacking find \\nthe car purchasing process distasteful.

The more thorough your prepurchase activities, the more satisfying your \\npurchase will be. \\nWhile you own the car, you will maximize the benefits enjoyed by operating the vehicle \\nsafely and by keeping it in good condition. Routine maintenance (e.g., replacing fluids, \\nrotating tires) can ensure the quality and longevity of your vehicle. New cars come with \\nowner’s manuals that detail a schedule of service requirements and good driving \\npractices for your vehicle. You will be required to keep the car legally insured and \\nregistered with the state where you reside, and you must maintain a valid license to \\ndrive. \\nNew cars, and some used cars, are sold with a warranty, which is a promise about the \\nquality of the product, made for a certain period of time. The terms and covered repair \\ncosts may vary. You should understand the terms of the warranty, especially if \\nsomething covered should need servicing, so that you know what repairs you may be \\ncharged for. The manufacturer, and sometimes the seller, issues the warranty. If you \\nhave questions about the warranty after purchasing, it may be best to contact the \\nmanufacturer directly. \\nIf you are dissatisfied with your purchase (and the fault seems to be with the car), your \\nfirst step should be a conversation with your dealer. If the problem is not addressed, you \\ncan contact the automobile company directly; its Web site will provide you with a \\ncustomer service contact. If the dealer and the manufacturer refuse to make good, you \\nshould contact your state’s consumer affairs division in the attorney general’s office. In \\nsome states, there are entire state agencies or departments devoted to auto purchases. \\nFor his first car Ray bought a ten-year-old coupe with only 60,000 miles on it for a price \\nthat seemed too good to be true.

When Ray complained, the seller claimed he didn’t know \\nabout the cracked block and pointed out that there was no warranty on the car, so Ray \\nwas out of luck. Fortunately, Ray had read that a defective car, referred to as a “lemon,” \\nis covered under laws that protect consumers who unknowingly purchase a car that \\nproves to be defective.

The house has a dual financial role as both \\na nest and a nest egg. \\nThere are substantial annual operating expenses for repairs and maintenance, \\ninsurance, and taxes. Maintenance preserves a home’s value, insurance protects that \\nvalue, and taxes for community services both enhance and secure its value. \\nA home purchase is typically financed with debt that creates a significant monthly \\nexpense, the mortgage payment, in your budget. A mortgage is a long-term debt that \\nobligates your cash flows for a long time, perhaps even reducing your choices of careers \\nand your mobility. \\nYour choice of home reflects personal factors in your life. These factors include your \\npersonal tastes, your age and stage of life, your family size and circumstances, your \\nhealth, and your career choices.

Renting requires relatively few \\ninitial legal or financial commitments. The renter signs a lease that spells out the terms \\nof the rental agreement: term, rent, terms of payments and fees, restrictions such as pets \\nor smoking, and charges for damages. A renter is usually required to give the landlord a \\nsecurity deposit to cover the landlord’s costs of repairs or cleaning, as necessary, when \\nthe tenant moves out. If the deposit is not used, it is returned to the departing tenant \\n(although without any interest earned). \\nSome general advantages and disadvantages of renting and owning are shown in Figure \\n9.2 \"Renting versus Owning\". \\nFigure 9.2 Renting versus Owning \\n \\nThe choice of whether to rent or to own follows the pattern of life stages. People rent \\nearly in their adult lives because they typically have fewer financial resources and put a \\nhigher value on mobility, usually to keep more career flexibility.

This is the mid-adult stage of accumulating assets and building wealth. As \\nincome rises, the tax benefit becomes more valuable, too. \\nOften, in retirement, with both incomes and family size smaller, older adults will \\ndownsize to an apartment, shedding responsibilities and financial commitments. \\nHome ownership decisions vary: some people just never want the responsibilities of \\nownership, while some just always want a place of their own. \\nFinding an apartment is much like finding a home in terms of assessing its attributes, \\ncomparing choices, and making a choice. Landlords, property managers, and agents all \\nrent properties and use various media to advertise an available space. Since the rent for \\nan apartment is a regular expense, financed from current income (not long-term debt), \\nyou need to find only the apartment and not the financing, which simplifies the process \\nconsiderably. \\nAssessing Attributes \\nOnce you decide to own your home, you must choose the home to own, considering the \\ndifferent kinds of homes and of home ownership. \\nThere are single- and multiple-unit dwellings, for example. A multiple-unit dwelling \\ncan be used to create rental income or to house extended family members, but this \\nchoice imposes the responsibilities of being a landlord and also limits privacy. \\nThere are previously owned, new, and custom-built homes. Previously owned homes \\nmay require some renovation to make them comfortably modern and convenient. New \\nand custom-built homes typically have more modern features and conveniences and \\nrequire less maintenance and repair expense. Custom-built homes are built to the \\nhomeowners’ specifications. \\nSales of existing single-family homes far outnumber sales of new and custom homes. In \\nthe month of February 2009, for example, 4.72 million existing homes were sold \\ncompared to 337,000 sales of new homes. The average price of a new house in February \\n2009 in the United States was $251,000.[1]  \\nMobile homes are large trailers fitted with utilities connections, which can be installed \\non permanent sites and used as residences. A mobile home may also be situated in a \\ntrailer park or mobile home community where the owner rents a lot.

Residents do not own the units, but \\nrather own shares in the cooperative association, which entitles them to the right to \\ndwell in its housing units. \\nPersonal factors such as your age, family size, health, and career help you to answer \\nsome of the following key questions: \\n• How large should the house be? How many bedrooms and bathrooms? \\n• Which rooms are most important: kitchen, family room, or home office? \\n• Do you need parking or a garage? \\n• Do you need storage space? \\n• Do you need disability accommodation? \\n• Do you want outside space: a yard, patio, or deck? \\n• How important is privacy? \\n• How important is energy efficiency and other “green” features? \\n• How important are design features and appearance? \\n• How important is location and environmental factors? \\n• Proximity to work? Schools? Shopping? Family and friends? \\nAfter ranking the importance of such attributes, you can use an attribute-scoring matrix \\nto score your choices. After understanding exactly what you are looking for in a home, \\nyou should begin to think about how much house you can afford. \\nAssessing Affordability \\nBefore looking for a house that offers what you want, you need to identify a price range \\nthat you can afford. Most people use financing to purchase a home, so your ability to \\naccess financing or get a loan will determine the price range of the house you can buy. \\nSince your home and your financing are long-term commitments, you need to be careful \\nto try to include future changes in your thinking. \\nFor example, Jill and Jack are both twenty-five years old, newly married, and looking to \\nbuy their first home. Both work and earn good incomes. The real estate market is strong, \\nespecially with mortgage rates relatively low. They buy a two-bedroom condo in a new \\ndevelopment as a starter home. \\nFast-forward five years. Jill is expecting their second child; while the couple is happy \\nabout the new baby, neither can imagine how they will all fit in their already cramped \\nspace. They would love to sell the condo and purchase a larger home with a yard for the \\nkids, but the real estate market has slowed, mortgage rates have risen, and a plant '),\n",

Jill hasn’t worked outside \\nthe home since their first child was born two years ago— they are just getting by on one \\nsalary and a new baby will increase their expenses— making it even more difficult to \\nthink about financing a larger home. \\nA lender will look at your income, your current debts, and credit history to assess your \\nability to assume a mortgage. As discussed in Chapter 7 \"Financial Management\", your \\ncredit score is an important tool for the lender, who may also request verification of \\nemployment and income from your employer. \\nLenders do their own calculations of how much debt you can afford, based on a \\nreasonable percentage, usually about 33 percent, of your monthly gross income that \\nshould go toward your monthly housing costs, or \\nprincipal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI)Principal, interest, taxes, and insurance \\nare the costs of home ownership. PITI is usually calculated on a monthly basis in the \\nprocess of determining the affordability of a mortgage.. If you have other debts, your \\nPITI plus your other debt repayments should be no more than about 38 percent of your \\ngross income. Those percentages will be adjusted for income level, credit score, and \\namount of the down payment. \\nSay the lender assumes that 38 percent of your monthly gross income (annual gross \\nincome divided by twelve) should cover your PITI plus any other debt payments. \\nSubtracting your other debt payments and estimated cost of taxes and insurance leaves \\nyou with a figure for affordable monthly mortgage payments. Dividing that figure by the \\nmortgage factor for your mortgage’s maturity and mortgage rate shows the affordable \\nmortgage overall. Knowing what percentage your mortgage will be of the home’s \\npurchase price, you can calculate the maximum purchase price of the home that you can \\nafford. That affordable home purchase price is based on your gross income, other debts, \\ntaxes, insurance, mortgage rate, mortgage maturity, and down payment. \\nFigure 9.5 \"Mortgage Affordability Calculation\" shows an example of this calculation for \\na thirty-year, 6.5 percent mortgage. \\nFigure 9.5 Mortgage Affordability Calculation '),\n",

You may want to sit down with a potential lender and have this \\ndiscussion before you do any serious house hunting, so that you have a price range in \\nmind before you shop. Mortgage affordability calculators are also available online. \\nSearching for a Home \\nAfter understanding exactly what you are looking for in a home and what you can afford, \\nyou can organize your efforts and begin your search. \\nTypically, buyers use a realtor and realty listings to identify homes for sale. A real \\nestate broker can add value to your search by providing information about the house \\nand property, the neighborhood and its schools, recreational and cultural opportunities, \\nand costs of living. \\nRemember, however, that the broker or its agent, while helping you gather information \\nand assess your choices, is working for the sellers and will be compensated by the seller \\nwhen a sale is made. Consider paying for the services of a buyer’s agent, a fee-based real \\nestate broker who works for the buyer to identify choices independently of the purchase. \\nThe real estate industry is regulated by state and federal laws as well as by self-\\nregulatory bodies, and real estate agents must be licensed to operate. \\nIncreasingly, sellers are marketing their homes directly to save the cost of using a \\nbroker. A real estate broker typically takes a negotiable amount up to 6 percent of the \\npurchase price, from which it pays a commission to the real estate agent. “For sale by \\nowner” sites on the Internet can make the exchange of housing information easier and \\nmore convenient for both buyers and sellers. For example, Web sites such as \\nPicketfencepreview.com serve home sellers and buyers directly.

Many states require a home inspection before signing a purchase \\nagreement or as a condition of the agreement. A standard home inspection checklist, \\nbased on information from the National Association of Certified Home Inspectors, is \\nshown in Figure 9.6 \"Standard Home Inspection Checklist\". \\nFigure 9.6 Standard Home Inspection Checklist \\n \\nAs with a car, it is best to hire a professional (a structural engineer, contractor, or \\nlicensed home inspector) to do the home inspection. For example, see the American \\nAssociation of Home Inspectors at http://www.ashi.org/. A professional will be able to \\nspot not only potential problems but also evidence of past problems that may have been \\nfixed improperly or that may recur— for example, water in the basement or leaks in the \\nroof. If there are problems, you will need an estimate for the cost of fixing them. If there \\nare significant and immediate repair or renovation costs projected by the home’s \\ncondition, you may try to reduce the purchase price of the property by those costs. You \\ndon’t want any surprises after you buy the house, especially costly ones. \\nYou will also want to do a title search, as required by your lender, to verify that there are \\nno liens or claims outstanding against the property. For example, the previous owners \\nmay have had a dispute with a contractor and never paid his bill, and the contractor may \\nhave filed a lien or a claim against the property that must be resolved before the \\nproperty can change hands. There are several other kinds of liens; for example, a tax lien \\nis imposed to secure payment of overdue taxes. \\nA lawyer or a title search company can do the search, which involves checking the \\nmunicipal or town records where a lien would be filed.

House prices are determined by forces of supply and demand, which \\nin turn are determined by macroeconomic circumstances. \\nWhen the economy is contracting and incomes are decreasing, and especially if \\nunemployment rises and incomes become uncertain, buyers are hesitant to add the \\nsignificant financial responsibility of new debt to their budgets. They tend to continue \\nwith their present arrangements or may try to move into cheaper housing, downsizing to \\na smaller house, an apartment, or condo to decrease operating expenses. When the \\neconomy is expanding, on the other hand, expectations of rising incomes may encourage \\nbuyers to be bolder with their purchasing decisions. \\nA house represents not only a housing expense but also an investment that can serve as \\na store of wealth. In theory, if a contraction creates a market with declining asset values, \\ninvestors will seek out alternative investments, abandoning that market. In other words, \\nif house prices decline, the house’s value as an investment will decline. Investors will \\nseek other assets in which to store wealth to avoid the opportunity cost of making an \\ninvestment that does not generate returns. \\nHousing markets are local, however. If the local economy is dominated by one industry \\nor by one large employer, the housing market will be sensitive to the fate of that industry \\nor employer. If a location has value independent of the local economy, such as value as a \\nvacation or retirement location, that value can offset local concerns. In that case, \\nhousing prices may be less sensitive to the local economy. \\nSince a house is an investment, the home buyer is concerned about its expected future \\nvalue. Future value is not easy to predict, however, as housing markets have some \\nvolatility. In extreme periods, for example between 2004 and 2009, there was extreme \\nvolatility (read more on the real estate bubble in Chapter 13 \"Behavioral Finance and \\nMarket Behavior\"). Thus, depending on how long you intend to own the home, it may or \\nmay not be realistic to try to predict price trends based on macroeconomic cycles or \\nfactors. Some areas may seem to be always desirable, such as Manhattan’s East Side or \\nMalibu, California, but a severe economic shock or boom can affect prices in those areas \\nas well. \\nFigure 9.7 \"U.S. Housing Prices 1890–2005 (Inflation-Adjusted Dollars)\" shows \\nhousing prices in the United States from 1890 to 2005 in inflation-adjusted dollars. \\nFigure 9.7 U.S. Housing Prices 1890–2005 (Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) '),\n",

For example, for the half-century \\nfrom the end of World War II until the mid-1990s, housing prices were fairly flat, as \\nthey were in the period from around 1920 to 1940. This suggests that while a house may \\nbe used to store value, it may not generate a real increase in wealth. It seems that over \\nthe long term, housing prices are not highly sensitive to economic cycles, population \\ngrowth, building costs, or even interest rates. \\nSince the early 2000s, however, housing prices have soared. Most economists attribute \\nthis to a sustained period of low unemployment rates, low mortgage rates, and economic \\ngrowth. As bubbles do, this one eventually burst in 2007 as the economy slumped into a \\nrecession. Housing demand and prices fell, even with low mortgage rates, creating a real \\nbuyer’s market. Many economists attribute the severity of the slump to the banking \\ncrisis that froze the credit markets, because most housing purchases are financed with \\ndebt. \\nAbility to buy a house rests on the ability to finance the purchase, to provide a down \\npayment, and to borrow. That ability is determined by the buyer’s personal situation \\n(e.g., stability of employment or income, credit history) and by macroeconomic events \\nsuch as interest rate levels, expected inflation, and liquidity in the credit markets. If \\ninterest rates and inflation are low and there is liquidity in the credit markets, it will be \\neasier for buyers to borrow than if inflation and interest rates are high and the credit \\nmarket is illiquid. Demand for housing thus relies on the availability of credit for the \\nhousing market. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Different building structures are \\no single-unit or multiple-unit dwellings or mobile homes; \\no previously owned, new, or custom built. \\n'),\n",

Determine the effect of points on the monthly mortgage payment.  \\n6. Identify potential closing costs. \\nJust as your house may be your most significant purchase, your mortgage may be your \\nmost significant debt. The principal may be many times one year’s disposable income \\nand may need to be paid over fifteen or thirty years. The house secures the loan, so if \\nyou default or miss payments, the lender may foreclose on your house or claim \\nownership of the property, evict you, and resell the house to recover what you owed. You \\nmay lose not only your house but also your home. \\nBanks, credit unions, finance companies, and mortgage finance companies sell \\nmortgages. They profit by lending and competing for borrowers. It makes sense to shop \\naround for a mortgage, as rates and terms (i.e., the borrowers’ costs and conditions) \\nmay vary widely. The Internet has made it easy to compare; a quick search for \\n“mortgage rates” yields many Web sites that provide national and state averages, \\nlenders in your area, comparable rates and terms, and free mortgage calculators. \\nYou may feel more comfortable getting your mortgage through your local bank, which \\nmay process the loan and then sell the mortgage to a larger financial institution. The \\nlocal bank usually continues to service the loan, to collect the payments, but those cash \\nflows are passed through to the financial institution (usually a much larger bank) that \\nhas bought the mortgage. This secondary mortgage market allows your local bank to \\nhave more liquidity and less risk, as it gets repaid right away, allowing it to make more \\nloans. As long as you continue to make your payments, your only interaction is with the \\nbank that is servicing the loan. Alternatively, local banks may earmark a percentage of \\nmortgages to keep “in house” rather than sell. \\nThe U.S. government assists some groups to obtain home loans, such as Native \\nAmericans, Americans with disabilities, and veterans. See, for example, \\nhttp://www.homeloans.va.gov/ondemand_ vets_stream_video.htm. \\nKeep in mind that the costs discussed in this chapter, associated with various kinds of \\nmortgages, may change. The real estate market, government housing policies, and \\ngovernment regulation of the mortgage financing market may change at any time. When \\nit is time for you to shop for a mortgage, therefore, be sure you are informed of current \\ndevelopments. \\nDown Payment \\nMortgages require a down payment, or a percentage of the purchase price paid in cash \\nupon purchase. Most buyers use cash from savings, the proceeds of a house they are \\nselling, or a family gift. \\nThe size of the down payment does not affect the price of the house, but it can affect the \\ncost of the financing. For a certain house price, the larger the down payment, the '),\n",

An \\nexample of a thirty-year mortgage is shown in Figure 9.9 \"Down Payment and Monthly \\nPayment\". \\nFigure 9.9 Down Payment and Monthly Payment \\n \\nUsually, if the down payment is less than 20 percent of the property’s sale price, the \\nborrower has to pay for private mortgage insurance, which insures the lender \\nagainst the costs of default. A larger down payment eliminates this expense for the \\nborrower. \\nThe down payment can offset the annual cost of the financing, but it creates opportunity \\ncost and decreases your liquidity as you take money out of savings. Cash will also be \\nneeded for the closing costs or transaction costs of this purchase or for any immediate \\nrenovations or repairs. Those needs will have to be weighed against your available cash \\nto determine the amount of your down payment. \\nMonthly Payment \\nThe monthly payment is the ongoing cash flow obligation of the loan. If you don’t pay \\nthis payment, you are in default on the loan and may eventually lose the house with no \\ncompensation for the money you have already put into it. Your ability to make the \\nmonthly payment determines your ability to keep the house. \\nThe interest rate and the maturity (lifetime of the mortgage) determine the monthly \\npayment amount. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate remains the same \\nover the entire maturity of the mortgage, and so does the monthly payment. \\nConventional mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages for thirty, twenty, or fifteen years. \\nThe longer the maturity, the greater the interest rate, because the lender faces more risk \\nthe longer it takes for the loan to be repaid. \\n'),\n",

Some of the payment is repayment of the principal and some is for the interest \\nexpense. As you make a payment, your balance gets smaller, and so the interest portion \\nof your next payment is smaller, and the principal payment is larger. In other words, as \\nyou continue making payments, you are paying off the balance of the loan faster and \\nfaster and paying less and less interest. \\nAn example of a mortgage amortization, or a schedule of interest and principal \\npayments over the life of the loan, is shown in Figure 9.10 \"A Mortgage Amortization: \\nYear One of a Thirty-Year, Fixed-Rate 6.5 Percent Mortgage\". The mortgage is a thirty-\\nyear, fixed-rate mortgage. Only year one is shown, but the spreadsheet extends to show \\nthe amortization over the term of the mortgage. \\nFigure 9.10 A Mortgage Amortization: Year One of a Thirty-Year, Fixed-Rate 6.5 Percent \\nMortgage \\n \\nIn the early years of the mortgage, your payments are mostly interest, while in the last \\nyears they are mostly principal. It is important to distinguish between them because the \\nmortgage interest is tax deductible. That tax benefit is greater in the earlier years of the \\nmortgage, when the interest expense is larger. \\nMonthly mortgage payments can be estimated using the mortgage factor. The \\nmortgage factor is a calculation of the payment per $1,000 of the mortgage loan, given \\nthe interest rate and the maturity of the mortgage. Mortgage factors for thirty-, twenty-, \\nand fifteen-year mortgages are shown in Figure 9.11 \"Mortgage Factors for Various \\nMortgage Rates\". \\nFigure 9.11 Mortgage Factors for Various Mortgage Rates \\n'),\n",

If you used a fifteen-year mortgage, your monthly payment would be 8.71 × \\n$200,000 ÷ 1,000 = $1,742. If you got the thirty-year mortgage but at a rate of 6 \\npercent, your monthly payment would be $1,200. \\nPotential lenders and many Web sites provide mortgage calculators to do these \\ncalculations, so you can estimate your monthly payments for a fixed-rate mortgage if \\nyou know the mortgage rate, the term to maturity, and the principal borrowed. \\nMortgage Designs \\nSo far, the discussion has focused on fixed-rate mortgages, that is, mortgages with fixed \\nor constant interest rates, and therefore payments, until maturity. With an adjustable-\\nrate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate— and the monthly payment— can change. If \\ninterest rates rise, the monthly payment will increase, and if they fall, it will decrease. By \\nfederal law, increases in ARM interest rates cannot rise more than 2 percent at a time, \\nbut even with this rate cap, homeowners with ARMs are at risk of seeing their monthly \\npayment increase. Borrowers can limit this interest rate risk with a payment cap, which, \\nhowever, introduces another risk. \\n'),\n",

That \\nsounds like it would protect the borrower, but if the payment is capped and the interest \\nrate rises, more of the payment pays for the interest expense and less for the principal \\npayment, so the balance is paid down more slowly. If interest rates are high enough, the \\npayment may be too small to pay all the interest expense, and any interest not paid will \\nadd to the principal balance of the mortgage. \\nIn other words, instead of paying off the mortgage, your payments may actually increase \\nyour debt, and you could end up owing more money than you borrowed, even though \\nyou make all your required payments on time. This is called negative amortization. You \\nshould make sure you know if your ARM mortgage is this type of loan. You can \\nvoluntarily increase your monthly payment amount to avoid the negative effects of a \\npayment cap. \\nAdjustable-rate mortgages are risky for borrowers. ARMs are usually offered at lower \\nrates than fixed-rate mortgages, however, and may be more affordable. Borrowers who \\nexpect an increase in their disposable incomes, which would offset the risk of a higher \\npayment, or who expect a decrease in interest rates, may prefer an adjustable-rate \\nmortgage, which can have a maturity of up to forty years. Otherwise, a fixed-rate \\nmortgage is better. \\nThere are mortgages that combine fixed and variable rates— for example, offering a fixed \\nrate for a specified period of time, and then an adjustable rate. Another type of mortgage \\nis a balloon mortgage that offers fixed monthly payments for a specified period, \\nusually three, five, or seven years, and then a final, large repayment of the principal. \\nThere are option ARMs, where you pay either interest only or principal only for the first \\nfew years of the loan, which makes it more affordable. While you are paying interest \\nonly, however, you are not accumulating equity in your investment. \\nAs an asset, a house may be used to secure other types of loans. A home equity loan \\nor a second mortgage allows a homeowner to borrow against any equity in the home. A \\nhome improvement loan is a type of home equity loan. A \\nhome equity line of credit (HELOC) allows the homeowner to secure a line of \\ncredit, or a loan that is borrowed and paid down as needed, with interest paid only on \\nthe outstanding balance. A reverse mortgage is designed to provide homeowners with \\nhigh equity a monthly income in the form of a loan. A reverse mortgage essentially is a \\nloan against your home that you do not have to pay back for as long as you live there. To \\nbe eligible for most reverse mortgages, you must own your home and be sixty-two years \\nof age or older. You or your estate repays the loan when you sell the house or die. \\nPoints \\nPoints are another kind of financing cost. One point is one percent of the mortgage. \\nPoints are paid to the lender as a form of prepaid interest when the mortgage originates \\nand are used to decrease the mortgage rate. In other words, paying points is a way of \\nbuying a lower mortgage rate. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 223}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  224 \\nIn deciding whether or not it is worth it to pay points, you need to think about the \\ndifference that the lower mortgage rate will make to your monthly payment and how \\nlong you will be paying this mortgage. How long will it take for the points to pay for \\nthemselves in reduced monthly payments? For example, suppose you have the following \\nchoices for a thirty-year, fixed rate, $200,000 mortgage: a mortgage rate of 6.5 percent \\nwith no points or a rate of 6 percent with 2 points. \\nFirst, you can calculate the difference in your monthly payments for the two different \\nsituations. Using the mortgage factor for a thirty-year mortgage, the monthly payments \\nin each case would be the mortgage factor × $200,000 ÷ 1,000 or \\nPoints Mortgage rate Mortgage factor Monthly payment \\n0 6.50% 6.32 1,264 \\n2 6.00% 6.00 1,200 \\nPaying the two points buys you a lower monthly payment and saves you $64 dollars per \\nmonth. The two points cost $4,000 (2 percent of $200,000). At the rate of $64 per \\nmonth, it will take 62.5 months ($4,000 ÷ 64) or a little over five years for those points \\nto pay for themselves. If you do not plan on having this mortgage for that long, then \\npaying the points is not worth it. Paying points has liquidity and opportunity costs up \\nfront that must be weighed against its benefit. Points are part of the closing costs, but \\nborrowers do not have to pay them if they are willing to pay a higher interest rate \\ninstead. \\nClosing Costs \\nOther costs of a house purchase are transaction costs, that is, costs of making the \\ntransaction happen that are not direct costs of either the home or the financing. These \\nare referred to as closing costs, as they are paid at the closing, the meeting between \\nbuyer and seller where the ownership and loan documents are signed and the property \\nis actually transferred. The buyer pays these closing costs, including the appraisal fee, \\ntitle insurance, and filing fee for the deed. \\nThe lender will have required an independent appraisal of the home’s value to make \\nsure that the amount of the mortgage is reasonable given the value of the house that \\nsecures it. The lender will also require a title search and contract for title insurance. \\nThe title company will research any claims or liens on the deed; the purchase cannot go \\nforward if the deed may not be freely transferred. Over the term of the mortgage, the \\ntitle insurance protects against flaws not found in the title and any claims that may \\nresult. The buyer also pays a fee to file the property deed with the township, \\nmunicipality, or county. Some states may also have a property transfer tax that is the \\nresponsibility of the buyer. \\nClosings may take place in the office of the title company handling the transaction or at \\nthe registry of deeds. Closings also may take place in the lender’s offices, such as a bank, \\nor an attorney’s office and usually are mediated between the buyer and the seller '),\n",

Lawyers who specialize in real estate ensure that all legal \\nrequirements are met and all filings of legal documents are completed. For example, \\nbefore signing, home buyers have a right to review a U.S. Housing and Urban \\nDevelopment (HUD) Settlement Statement twenty-four hours prior to the closing. This \\ndocument, along with a truth-in-lending disclosure statement, sets out and explains all \\nthe terms of the transaction, all the costs of buying the house, and all closing costs. Both \\nthe buyer and the seller must sign the HUD document and are legally bound by it. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The percentage of the purchase price paid upfront as the down payment will determine the \\namount that is borrowed. That principal balance on the mortgage, in turn, determines the \\nmonthly mortgage payment. \\n• A larger down payment may make the monthly payment smaller but creates the opportunity cost \\nof losing liquidity. \\n• A fixed-rate mortgage is structured as an annuity; the monthly mortgage payment can be \\ncalculated from the mortgage rate, the maturity, and the principal balance on the mortgage.  \\n• A fixed-rate mortgage has a fixed mortgage rate and fixed monthly payments.  \\n• An adjustable-rate mortgage may have an adjustable mortgage rate and/or adjustable payments.  \\n• A rate cap or a payment cap may be used to offset the effects of an adjustable -rate mortgage on \\nmonthly payments. \\n• Points are borrowing costs paid upfront (rather than over the maturity of the mortgage).  \\n• Closing costs are transaction costs such as an appraisal fee, title search and title insurance, filing \\nfees for legal documents, transfer taxes, and sometimes realtors’ commissions. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

If those conditions are the seller’s responsibility, you \\nwill want to be sure that they have been fulfilled before closing. Read all the documents \\nbefore you sign them and get copies of everything you sign. Do not hesitate to ask \\nquestions. You will live with your mortgage, and your house, for a long time. \\nCapital Expenditures \\nA house and property need care; even a new home will have repair and maintenance \\ncosts. These costs are now a part of your living expenses or operating budget. \\nIf you have purchased a home that requires renovation or repair, you will decide how \\nmuch of the work you can do immediately and how much can be done on an annual \\nbasis. A capital budget is helpful to project these capital expenditures and plan the \\nincome or savings to finance them. You can prioritize these costs by their urgency and \\nby how they will be done. \\nFor example, Sally and Chris just closed on an older home and are planning renovations. \\nDuring the home inspection, they learned that the old stone foundation would need \\nsome work. They would like to install more energy-efficient windows and paint the walls \\nand strip and refinish the old, wood floors. \\nTheir first priority should be the foundation on which the house rests. The windows \\nshould be the next on the list, as they will not only provide comfort but also reduce the \\nheating and cooling expenses. Cosmetic repairs such as painting and refinishing can be \\ndone later. The walls should be done first (in case any paint drips on the floors) and then \\nthe floors. \\nRenovations should increase the resale value of your home. It is tempting to customize \\nrenovations to suit your tastes and needs, but too much customization will make it more \\ndifficult to realize the value of those renovations when it comes time to sell. You will \\nhave a better chance of selling at a higher price if there is more demand for it, if it \\nappeals to as many potential buyers as possible. The more customized or “quirky” it is, \\nthe less broad its appeal may be. \\nEarly Payment '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 228}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  229 \\nTwo financing decisions may come up during the life of a mortgage: early payment \\nand refinancing. Some mortgages have an early payment penalty that fines the \\nborrower for repaying the loan before it is due, but most do not. If your mortgage does \\nnot, you may be able to pay it off early (before maturity) either with a lump sum or by \\npaying more than your required monthly payment and having the excess payment \\napplied to your principal balance. \\nIf you are thinking of paying off your mortgage with a lump sum, then you are weighing \\nthe value of your liquidity, the opportunity cost of giving up cash, against the cost of the \\nremaining interest payments. The cost of giving up your cash is the loss of any \\ninvestment return you may otherwise have from it. You would compare that to the cost \\nof your mortgage, or your mortgage rate, less the tax benefit that it provides. \\nFor example, suppose you can invest cash in a money market mutual fund (MMMF) that \\nearns 7 percent. Your mortgage rate is 6 percent, and your tax rate is 25 percent. Your \\nmortgage costs you 6 percent per year but saves you 25 percent of that in taxes, so your \\nmortgage really only costs you 4.5 percent, or 75 percent of 6 percent. After taxes, your \\nMMMF earns 5.25 percent, or 75 percent of 7 percent. Since your cash is worth more to \\nyou as a money market investment where it nets 5.25 percent than it costs you in \\nmortgage interest (4.5 percent), you should leave it in the mutual fund and pay your \\nmortgage incrementally as planned. \\nOn the other hand, if your money market mutual fund earns 5 percent, but your \\nmortgage rate is 8 percent and you are in the 25 percent tax bracket, then the real cost of \\nyour mortgage is 6 percent, which is more than your cash can earn. You would be better \\noff using the cash to pay off your mortgage and eliminating that 6 percent interest cost. \\nYou also need to weigh the use of your cash to pay off the mortgage versus other uses of \\nthat cash. For example, suppose you have some money saved. It is earning less than \\nyour after-tax mortgage interest, so you are thinking of paying down the mortgage. \\nHowever, you also know that you will need a new car in two years. If you use that money \\nto pay down the mortgage now, you won’t have it to pay for the car two years from now. \\nYou could get a car loan to buy the car, but the interest rate on that loan will be higher \\nthan the rate on your mortgage, and the interest on the car loan is not tax deductible. If \\npaying off your mortgage debt forces you to use more expensive debt, then it is not \\nworth it. \\nOne way to pay down a mortgage early without sacrificing too much liquidity is by \\nmaking a larger monthly payment. The excess over the required amount will be applied \\nto your principal balance, which then decreases faster. Since you pay interest on the \\nprincipal balance, reducing it more quickly would save you some interest expense. If you \\nhave had an increase in income, you may be able to do this fairly “painlessly,” but then \\nagain, there may be a better use for your increased income. \\nOver a mortgage as long as thirty years, that interest expense can be substantial— more \\nthan the original balance on the mortgage. However, that choice must be made in the \\ncontext of the value of your alternatives. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 229}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  230 \\nRefinancing \\nYou may think about refinancing your mortgage if better mortgage rates are available. \\nRefinancing means borrowing a new debt or getting a new mortgage and repaying the \\nold one. It involves closing costs: the lender will want an updated appraisal, a title \\nsearch, and title insurance. It is valuable to refinance if the mortgage rate will be so \\nmuch lower that your monthly payment will be substantially reduced. That in turn \\ndepends on the size of your mortgage balance. \\nIf interest rates are low enough and your home has appreciated so that your equity has \\nincreased, you may be able to refinance and increase the principal balance on the new \\nmortgage without increasing the monthly payment over your old monthly payment. If \\nyou do that, you are withdrawing equity from your house, but you are not allowing it to \\nperform as an investment, that is to store your wealth. \\nIf you would rather take gains from the house and invest them differently, that may be a \\ngood choice. But if you want to take gains from the house and use those for \\nconsumption, then you are reducing the investment returns on your home. You are also \\nusing nonrecurring income to finance recurring expenses, which is not sustainable. \\nThere is also a danger that property value will decrease and you will be left with a \\nmortgage worth more than your home. \\nDefault, Foreclosure, and Fraud \\nIf you have a change of circumstances— for example, you lose your job in an economic \\ndownturn, or you have unexpected health care costs in your family— you may find that \\nyou are unable to meet your mortgage obligations as planned: to make the payments. A \\nmortgage is secured by the property it financed. If you miss payments and default on \\nyour mortgage, the lender has recourse to foreclose on your property, to evict you and \\ntake possession of your home, and then to sell it or lease it to recover its investment. \\nUnder normal circumstances, lenders incur a cost in repossessing a home, and usually \\nlose money in its resale. It may be possible to renegotiate terms of your mortgage to \\nforestall foreclosure. You may want to consult with a legal representative, or to contact \\nfederal and/or state agencies for assistance. \\nYou may believe you are having trouble meeting your mortgage obligations because they \\nare not what you thought they would be. Lenders profit by lending. When you are \\nborrowing, it is important to understand the terms of your loan. If those terms will \\nadjust under certain conditions, you must understand what could happen to your \\npayments and to the value of your home. It is your responsibility to understand these \\nconditions. However, the lender has a responsibility to disclose the lending arrangement \\nand all its costs, according to federal and state laws (which vary by state). If you believe \\nthat all conditions and terms of your mortgage were not fairly disclosed, you should \\ncontact your state banking regulator or the U.S Department of Housing and Urban \\nDevelopment (HUD). There are also consumer advocacy groups that will help clarify the \\nlaws and explore any legal recourse you may have. '),\n",

You can try to avoid them or reduce their likelihood and \\nconsequences, but you cannot eliminate them. You can, however, pay someone to share \\nthem. That is the idea behind insurance. \\nThere are speculative risks, that is, risks that offer a chance of loss or gain, such as \\ndeveloping a “killer app” that may or may not sell or investing in a corporate stock that \\nmay or may not provide good returns. Such risks can be avoided simply by not \\nparticipating. They are almost always uninsurable. \\nThere are pure risks accidental or unintentional events, such as a car accident or an \\nillness. Pure risks are insurable because their probabilities can be calculated precisely \\nenough for the risk to be quantified, which means it can be priced, bought, and sold. \\nRisk shifting is the process of selling risk to someone who then assumes the risk and \\nits consequences. Why would someone buy your risk? Because in a large enough market, \\nyour risk can be diversified, which minimizes its cost. \\nInsurance can be purchased for your property and your home, your health, your \\nemployment, and your life. In each case, you weigh the cost of the consequence of a risk \\nthat may never actually happen against the cost of insuring against it. Deciding what \\nand how to insure is really a process of deciding what the costs of loss would be and how \\nwilling you are to pay to get rid of those risks. \\nThe costs of insurance can also be lowered through risk avoidance or reduction \\nstrategies. For example, installing an alarm system in your home may reduce \\nhomeowners’ insurance premiums because that reduces the risk of theft. Of course, \\ninstalling an alarm system has a cost too. Risk management is the strategic trade-off of \\nthe costs of reducing, assuming, and shifting risks. \\n10.1 Insuring Your Property \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1.

Compare the kinds of auto insurance to cover bodily injury and property damage.  \\n6. Explain the factors that determine auto insurance costs. \\n7. Analyze the factors used in determining the risks of the driver, the car, and the driving region.  \\nProperty insurance is ownership insurance: it insures that the rights of ownership \\nconferred upon you when you purchased your property will remain intact. Typically, \\nproperty insurance covers loss of use from either damage or theft; loss of value, or the \\ncost of replacement; and liability for any use of the property that causes damage to \\nothers or others’ property. For most people, insurable property risks are covered by \\ninsuring two kinds of property: car and home. \\nLoss of use and value can occur from hazards such as fire or weather disasters and from \\ndeliberate destruction such as vandalism or theft. When replacement or repair is needed \\nto restore usefulness and value, that cost is the cost of your risk. For example, if your \\nlaptop’s hard drive crashes, you not only have the cost of replacing or repairing it, but \\nalso the cost of being without your laptop for however long that takes. Insuring your \\nlaptop shares that risk (and those costs) with the insurer. \\nLiability is the risk that your use of your property will injure someone or something else. \\nOwnership implies control of, and therefore responsibility for, property use. \\nFor example, you are liable for your dog’s attack on a pedestrian and for your fallen \\ntree’s damage to a neighbor’s fence. You also are liable for damage a friend causes while \\ndriving your car with your permission and for injury to your invited guests who trip over \\nyour lawn ornament, fall off your deck, or leave your party drunk. \\nLegal responsibility can be from \\n• negligence, or the failure to take usual precautions; \\n• strict liability, or responsibility for intentional or unintentional events; \\n• vicarious liability, or responsibility for someone else’s use of your possessions \\nor someone else’s activity for which you are responsible. \\nHome Insurance Coverage \\nHomeowner’s insurance insures both the structure and the personal possessions that \\nmake the house your home. Renter’s insurance protects your possessions even if you are \\nnot the owner of your dwelling. You may not think you need insurance until you are the \\nhomeowner, but even when you don’t need to insure against possible damage or liability \\nfor your dwelling, you can still insure your possessions. Even if your furniture came \\nfrom your aunt’s house or a yard sale, it could cost a lot to replace. \\nIf you have especially valuable possessions such as jewelry or fine musical instruments, \\nyou may want to insure them separately to get enough coverage for them. Such items are '),\n",

Items should be appraised by a certified appraiser \\nto determine their replacement or insured value. \\nA good precaution is to have an up-to-date inventory of your possessions such as \\nfurniture, clothing, electronics, and appliances, along with photographs or video \\nshowing these items in your home. That inventory should be kept somewhere else, such \\nas a safe deposit box. If the house suffered damage, you would then have the inventory \\nto help you document your losses. \\nA homeowners’ policy covers damage to the structure itself as well as any outbuildings \\non the property and, in some cases, even the landscaping or infrastructure on the \\ngrounds, such as a driveway. \\nA homeowners’ policy does not cover \\n• animals; \\n• property of renters, or property kept in an apartment regularly rented; \\n• business property, even if the business is conducted on the residential premises. \\nAccording to information from the Insurances Services Office (http://www.iso.com), an \\ninsurance industry data and research company, hazards covered by the homeowner’s \\npolicy include \\n• fire or lightning; \\n• windstorm or hail; \\n• explosion; \\n• riot or civil commotion; \\n• damage caused by aircraft; \\n• damage caused by vehicles; \\n• smoke; \\n• vandalism or malicious mischief; \\n• theft; \\n• volcanic eruption; \\n• falling objects; \\n• weight of ice, snow, or sleet; \\n• accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, \\nheating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective sprinkler system, or from a \\nhousehold appliance; \\n• sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of a steam or \\nhot water heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective system; \\n• freezing of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective \\nsprinkler system, or of a household appliance; \\n• sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current (does \\nnot include loss to a tube, transistor, or similar electronic component).

The cost of \\ntemporary housing and extra living expenses while repairs are made is covered, \\nalthough usually for a limited time or amount. \\nHomeowners’ policies cover liability for injuries on the property and for injuries that the \\nhomeowner may accidentally inflict.

If you participate in activities where you are assuming \\nresponsibilities for others— you are taking the Cub Scout pack out for a hike, for \\nexample, or volunteering at your local recycling center— you may want such extended \\nliability coverage available through your homeowners’ policy (also available separately). \\nHome Insurance Coverage: The Benefit \\nHome insurance policies automatically cover your possessions for up to 40 percent of \\nthe house’s insured value. You can buy more coverage if you think they are worth more. \\nThe benefits are specified as either actual cash value or replacement cost. Actual \\ncash value tries to estimate the actual market value of the item at the time of loss, so it \\naccounts for the original cost less any depreciation that has occurred. Replacement cost \\nis the cost of replacing the item. For most items, the actual cash value is less. \\nFor example, say your policy insures items at actual cash value. You are claiming the \\nloss of a ten-year-old washer and dryer that were ruined when a pipe burst and your \\nbasement flooded. Your coverage could mean a benefit of $100 (based on the market \\nprice of ten-year-old appliances). However, to replace your appliances with comparable \\nnew ones could cost $1,000 or more. \\nThe actual cash value is almost always less than the replacement value, because prices \\ngenerally rise over time and because items generally depreciate (rather than appreciate) \\nin value. A policy that specifies benefits as replacement costs offers more actual \\ncoverage. Guaranteed replacement costs are the full cost of replacing your items, \\nwhile extended replacement costs are capped at some percentage— for example, 125 \\npercent of actual cash value. \\nHome Insurance Coverage: The Cost \\nYou buy home insurance by paying a premium to the insurance company. The insurance \\npurchase is arranged through a broker, who may represent more than one insurance \\ncompany. The broker should be knowledgeable about various policies, coverage, and \\npremiums offered by different insurers. '),\n",

Risk is determined by \\n• the insured (the person buying the policy), \\n• the property insured, \\n• the amount of coverage. \\nTo gauge the risk of the insured, the insurer needs information about your personal \\ncircumstances and history, the nature of the property, and the amount of coverage \\ndesired for protection.

That year, Arizona homeowners paid \\nan average of $640 for insurance that cost $1,409 in Texas.[1]  \\nPremiums can vary, even for the same levels of coverage for the same insured. You \\nshould compare policies offered by different insurers to shop around for the best \\npremium for the coverage you want. \\nInsuring Your Car \\nIf you own and drive a car, you must have car insurance. Your car accident may affect \\nnot only you and your car, but also the health and property of others. A car accident \\noften involves a second party, and so legal and financial responsibility must be assigned \\nand covered by both parties. In the United States, financial responsibility laws in each \\nstate mandate minimal car insurance, although what’s “minimal” varies by state. \\nConventionally, a victim or plaintiff in an accident is reimbursed by the driver at fault or \\nby his or her insurer. Fault has to be established, and the amount of the claim agreed to. \\nIn practice, this has often been done only through extensive litigation. \\nSome states in the United States and provinces in Canada have adopted some form of \\nno-fault insurance, in which, regardless of fault, an injured’s own insurance covers \\nhis or her damages and injuries, and a victim’s ability to sue the driver at fault is limited. \\nThe idea is to lower the incidence of court cases and speed up compensation for victims. \\nThe states with compulsory no-fault auto insurance, in which personal injury protection \\n(PIP) is required, include Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, \\nMinnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Puerto Rico. \\nEleven other states use no-fault as add-on or optional insurance.[2]  \\nThe remaining states in the United States use the conventional tort system (suing for \\ndamages in court). Understanding the laws of the state where you drive will help you to \\nmake better insurance decisions. \\nAuto Insurance Coverage \\nAuto insurance policies cover two types of consequences: bodily injury and property \\ndamage. Each covers three types of financial losses. Figure 10.5 \"Automobile Insurance \\nCoverage\" shows these different kinds of coverage. \\nFigure 10.5 Automobile Insurance Coverage '),\n",

Injuries to people in your car or to yourself are covered by \\nmedical payments coverage. Uninsured motorist protection covers your \\ninjuries if the accident is caused by someone with insufficient insurance or by an \\nunidentified driver. \\nProperty damage liability covers the costs to other people’s property from damage \\nthat you cause, while collision covers the costs of damage to your own property. \\nCollision coverage is limited to the market value of the car at the time, usually defined \\nby the National Automobile Dealers Association’s (NADA) Official Used Car Guide or \\n“blue book” (http://www.nada.org). To reduce their risk, the lenders financing your car \\nloan will require that you carry adequate collision coverage. \\nComprehensive physical damage covers your losses from anything other than a \\ncollision, such as theft, weather damage, acts of nature, or hitting an animal. \\nAuto insurance coverage is limited, depending on the policy. The limits are typically \\nstated in numbers representing thousands of dollars. For example, 100/300/50 means \\nthat $100,000 is the limit on the payment to one person in an accident; $300,000 is the \\nlimit on the amount paid in total (for all people) per accident; and $50,000 is the limit \\non the amount of property damage liability that can be paid out. \\nHere’s an example of how it all works. Kit is driving home one night from a late shift at \\nthe convenience store where he works. Sleepy, he drifts into the other lane of the two-\\nlane road and hits an oncoming car driven by Ray. Both Kit and Ray are injured, and \\nboth cars are damaged.

The cost of auto insurance is related to three factors that create risk: the car, \\nthe driver, and the driving environment— the region or rating territory. \\nThe model, style, and age of the car determine how costly it may be to repair or replace, \\nand therefore the potential cost of damage or collision. The higher that cost is, the \\nhigher the cost of insuring the car. For example, a 2009 luxury car will cost more to \\ninsure than a 2002 sedan. Also, different models have different safety features that may \\nlower the potential cost of injury to passengers, and those features may lower the cost of \\ninsurance. Different models may come with different security devices or be more or less \\nattractive to thieves, affecting the risk of theft. \\nThe driver is an obvious source of risk as the operator of the car. Insurers use various \\ndemographic factors such as age, education level, marital status, gender, and driving \\nhabits to determine which kinds of drivers present more risk. Not surprisingly, young \\ndrivers (ages sixteen to twenty-four) of both sexes and elderly drivers (over seventy) are \\nthe riskiest. Twice as many males as females die in auto accidents, but more females \\nsuffer injuries. Nationally, in any year your chances of being injured in a car accident are \\nabout one in a thousand.[3]  \\nYour driving history and especially your accident claim history can affect your \\npremiums, as well as your criminal record and credit score. In some states, an accident \\nclaim can double your cost of insurance over a number of years. Your driving habits—\\nwhether or not you use the car to commute to work, for example— can affect your costs \\nas well. Some states offer credits or points that reduce your premium if you have a safe \\ndriving record, are a member of the American Automobile Association (AAA), or have \\npassed a driver education course. \\nWhere you live and drive also matters. Insurers use police statistics to determine rates \\nof traffic accidents, auto theft, and vandalism, for example. If you are in an accident-\\n'),\n",

You can shop through a broker \\nor directly. Online discount auto insurers have become increasingly popular in recent \\nyears. Their rates may be lower, but the same cautions apply as for other high-stakes \\ntransactions conducted online. \\nAlso, premiums are not the only cost of auto insurance. You should also consider the \\ninsurer’s reliability in addressing a claim. Chances are you rely on your car to get to \\nschool, to work, or for your daily errands or recreational activities. Your car is also a \\nsubstantial investment, and you may still be paying off debt from financing your car. \\nLosing your car to repairs and perhaps being injured yourself is no small inconvenience \\nand can seriously disrupt your life. You want to be working with an insurer who will \\ncooperate in trying to get you and your car back on the road as soon as possible. You can \\ncheck your insurer’s reputation by the record of complaints against it, filed with your \\nstate’s agency of banking and insurance, or with your state’s attorney general’s office. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Property insurance is to insure the rights of ownership and to protect against its liabilities.  \\n• Property damage can be caused by hazards or by deliberate destruction, such as vandalism or \\ntheft. \\n• Homeowner’s policies insure structures and possessions for actual cash value or replacement \\ncost; an umbrella policy covers personal liability. \\n• The cost of homeowner’s insurance is determined by the insured, the property insured, and the \\nextent of the coverage and benefits. \\n• Auto insurance coverage insures bodily injury through \\no bodily injury liability, \\no medical payments coverage, \\no uninsured motorist protection. \\n• Auto insurance coverage insures property damage through \\no property damage liability, \\no collision, \\no comprehensive physical damage. \\n• Auto insurance costs are determined by the driver, the car, and the driving region.

The time to \\nunderstand your health coverage is before you need it. When you are recovering from an \\naccident or illness, you should not be concerned with your medical bills, yet you may \\nhave to be. \\nAccording to the National Coalition on Health Care (http://www.nchc.org), “Since 1999, \\nemployment-based health insurance premiums have increased 120 percent, compared \\nto cumulative inflation of 44 percent and cumulative wage growth of 29 percent during \\nthe same period.”[1]  \\nEven where employers “provide” health insurance as an employee benefit, in other \\nwords, workers are paying an increasing share of the premium. In 2008, that share \\naveraged 27 percent.[2]  \\nA 2005 “study found that 50 percent of all bankruptcy filings were partly the result of \\nmedical expenses. Every 30 seconds in the United States someone files for bankruptcy \\nin the aftermath of a serious health problem.”[3]  \\nEven if you think those numbers are exaggerated, it’s still sobering, because no matter \\nhow much you try to take care of yourself and to be careful, no one can evade the pure \\nrisk of injury or illness. All you can do is try to shift that risk in a way that makes sense \\nfor your financial health. \\nBecause of the increasing costs of health care and the increasing complexities of paying \\nfor them, the distribution and financing of health care is much discussed and debated in \\nthe United States, especially the roles of the federal government and insurance \\nproviders. Regardless of the outcome of this debate, momentum is building for change. \\nYou should be aware of changes as they occur so that you can incorporate those changes \\ninto your budget and financial plans. \\nHealth Insurance Coverage \\nThere are many different kinds of coverage and plans for health insurance. You may \\nhave group health insurance offered as an employee benefit or as a member of a \\nprofessional association. Group plans have lower costs, because the group has some \\nbargaining power with the insurer and can generally secure lower rates for its members. \\nBut group plans are not necessarily comprehensive, so you may want to supplement the \\ngroup coverage with an individual health insurance policy, available to individuals and \\nfamilies. \\nSufficient coverage should include basic insurance and major medical insurance. A \\nbasic insurance policy will cover physician expense, surgical expense, and hospital \\nexpense. \\n• Physician expenses include nonsurgical treatments and lab tests. \\n• Surgical expenses include surgeons’ fees. \\n• Hospital expenses include room and board and other hospital charges. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 244}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  245 \\nFrequently, these coverages are capped or limited. For example, hospital expense \\ncoverage is typically limited to a certain amount per day or a certain number of days per \\nincident. Surgeon’s fees are often capped. \\nThe three basic coverages are usually combined under one policy. In addition, health \\ninsurance is completed by major medical insurance, which covers the costs of a \\nserious injury or illness. Depending on the extent and the nature of your illness or \\ninjury, medical bills can quickly exceed your basic coverage limits, so major medical can \\nact as an extension to those limits, saving you from potential financial distress. \\nDental insurance also supplements your basic insurance, usually providing \\nreimbursement for preventative treatments and some partial payment of dental services \\nsuch as fillings, root canals, crowns, extractions, bridgework, and dentures. Vision \\ninsurance provides for eye care, including exams and treatment for eye diseases, as well \\nas for corrective lenses. Depending on your basic coverage limits, dental and vision care \\ncould be important for you. \\nAnother feature of basic coverage is a prescription drug plan. Prescriptions may be \\ncovered entirely or with a co-pay, or only if the generic version of the drug is available. \\nYour insurer should provide a formulary or a list of drugs that are covered. Depending \\non your plan, prescription coverage may be available only as a supplement to your basic \\ncoverage. \\nHealth Insurance Costs \\nAs health care costs and insurance premiums rise, insurers add cost offsets to make \\ntheir policies more affordable. Those offsets may include the following: \\n• Deductibles— an amount payable by the insured before any expenses are \\nassumed by the insurer. \\n• Co-pays— partial payment for certain costs— for example, for physician’s visits or \\nprescriptions. \\n• Coinsurance— shared payments of expenses by insured and insurer. \\nEach of these payment features represents responsibilities of the insured, that is, your \\nout-of-pocket costs. The more costs you shoulder, the less risk to the insurer, and so the \\nless you pay for the insurance policy. Making you responsible for initial costs also \\ndiscourages you from seeking health care more than is necessary or from submitting \\nfrivolous health care claims. \\nCosts vary with coverage, coverage limits, and offsets, and they vary widely between \\ninsurers. You should be well informed as to the specifics of your coverage, and you \\nshould compare rates before you buy. An insurance broker can help you to do this, and \\nthere are Web sites designed to help you explore the available options. See, for example, \\nthe health insurance consumer guide and resource links from the U.S. Department of \\nHealth and Human Services at http://www.ahrq.gov/consumer/insuranceqa/. '),\n",

Private insurers sell most of their plans to employers as group plans. \\nIndividuals are far more likely to purchase insurance through a service plan or managed \\ncare. \\nPrivate (for-profit) plans in most states are underwritten based on your age, weight, \\nsmoking status, and health history and are generally more expensive than other types of \\nplans. You may have to take a medical exam, and specific preexisting conditions— such \\nas asthma, heart disease, anxiety, or diabetes— could be excluded from coverage or used \\nas grounds for increasing the cost of your premium, based on your higher risk. \\nNevertheless, federal and state laws protect you from being denied health care coverage \\nbecause of any preexisting condition. \\nA service plan such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, consists of regional and \\nstate-based nonprofit agencies that sell both group and individual policies. More than \\nhalf of the health insurance companies in the United States are nonprofits, including, for \\nexample, Health Care Service Corporation and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care as among \\nthe largest (http://www.nonprofithealthcare.org/resources/BasicFactsAndFigures-\\nNonprofitHealthPlans9.9.08.pdf). \\nManaged care organizations became popular in the last thirty years or so with the \\nidea that providing preventative care would lower health care costs. Managed care takes \\nthe following forms: \\n• Health maintenance organizations \\n• Preferred provider organizations \\n• Exclusive provider organizations \\n• Point-of-service plans \\n• Traditional indemnity plans \\nThe two most familiar kinds of managed care are health maintenance organizations \\n(HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). A \\nhealth maintenance organization directly hires physicians to provide preventative, \\nbasic, and supplemental care. Preventative care should include routine exams and \\nscreening tests and immunizations. Basic care should include inpatient and outpatient \\ntreatments, emergency care, maternity care, and mental health and substance abuse \\nservices. As with any plan, the details for what defines “basic care” will vary, and you \\nshould check the fine print to make sure that services are provided. For example, the \\nplan may cover inpatient hospitalizations for a limited number of days in case of a \\nphysical illness, but inpatient hospitalization for a more limited number of days for a \\nmental illness. \\nSupplemental care typically includes the cost of vision and hearing care, prescriptions, \\nprosthetics devices, or home health care. Some or all of this coverage may be limited, or '),\n",

The premium paid to the HMO is a fixed, \\nmonthly fee, and you must seek care only within the HMO’s network of care providers. \\nThe most serious constraint of HMOs is the limited choice of doctors and the need to get \\na referral from your primary care physician (PCP) to obtain the services of any \\nspecialist. Depending on where you live and the availability of medical practitioners, this \\nmay or may not be an issue for you, but before joining an HMO, you should consider the \\naccessibility and convenience of the care that you are allowed, as well as the limitations \\nof the coverage. For example, if you are diagnosed with a serious disease or need a \\nspecific surgical technique, is there an appropriate specialist in the network that you can \\nconsult? Suppose you want a second opinion? The rules differ among HMOs, but these \\nare the kinds of questions that you should be asking. You should also be familiar with \\nthe HMO’s appeal procedures for coverage denied. \\nThe preferred provider organization (PPO) has a different arrangement with \\naffiliated physicians: it negotiates discounted rates directly with health care providers in \\nexchange for making them the “preferred providers” for members seeking care. Care by \\nphysicians outside the network may be covered, but with more limitations, or higher co-\\npays and deductibles. In exchange for offering the flexibility of more choices of provider, \\nthe PPO charges a higher premium. Services covered are similar to those covered by an \\nHMO. \\nThe exclusive provider organization works much like the PPO, except that out-of-\\nnetwork services are not covered at all and become out-of-pocket expenses for the \\ninsured. \\nThe point-of-service (POS) plan also uses a network of contracted, preferred \\nproviders. As in an HMO, you choose a primary care physician who then controls \\nreferrals to specialists or care beyond preventative and basic care. As in the PPO, out-of-\\nnetwork services may be used, but their coverage is more limited, and you pay higher \\nout-of-pocket expenses for co-pays and deductibles. \\nFigure 10.9 \"Managed Care Choices\" shows the differences in managed care options. \\nFigure 10.9 Managed Care Choices '),\n",

As health care costs have risen, \\nemployers in all industries have increasingly complained that this cost makes them less \\ncompetitive in global markets. As an incentive to have more people paying the costs of \\nhealth care themselves and to be less dependent on employers, the federal government \\nhas created tax deductions for savings earmarked for use in paying for health costs. \\nThese savings plans are known as flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health \\nreimbursement accounts (HRAs), and health savings accounts (HSAs). \\nA flexible savings account is used to supplement your basic coverage. It is offered by \\nemployers and funded by employees: you may have a tax-exempt deduction made from \\nyour paycheck to your flexible spending account. The money from your FSA may be \\nused for care expenses not normally covered by your plan— for example, orthodonture, \\nelder care, or child care. At the end of the year, any money remaining in your account is \\nforfeited; that is, it does not roll over into the next year. Unless you can foresee expenses \\nwithin the coming year, flexible spending may not be worth the tax break. \\nA health reimbursement account is an account funded by employers. The amount \\nis used to pay the premiums for basic coverage with a high deductible, and any money \\nleft over may be used for other health expenses, or, if unused, may be carried over to the \\nnext year. The account is yours until you leave your job, when it reverts back to your \\nemployer. \\nA health savings account (HSA) allows a tax-deductible contribution from your \\npaycheck to pay the premiums for catastrophic coverage with a high deductible and \\nwhatever out-of-pocket health care costs you may have. It is employee funded, employee \\nmanaged, and employee owned. Thus, it is yours, and you may take it with you when \\nyou change jobs. \\n'),\n",

If you are relatively young and healthy, and your health care need is \\nusually just an annual physical, this seems like an advantageous plan. However, \\nremember that the idea of insurance is to shift risk away from you, to pay someone to \\nassume the risk for you. With a high-deductible policy, you are still bearing a lot of risk. \\nIf that risk has the potential to cause a financial disaster, it’s too much. \\nIf you have employer-sponsored health insurance and you leave your job, you may be \\nentitled to keep your insurance for eighteen months (or more under certain \\ncircumstances). Under the 1985 Consolidated Budget Omnibus Reconciliation Act \\n(COBRA), an employee at a company with at least twenty employees who notifies the \\nemployer of his or her intention to maintain health care coverage is entitled to do so \\nprovided the employee pays the premiums. Some states extend this privilege to \\ncompanies with less than twenty employees, so you should check with your state’s \\ninsurance commissioner. You may also be able to convert your group coverage into an \\nindividual policy, although with more costly premiums. \\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 addresses \\nissues of transferring coverage, especially as happens with a change of jobs.

The \\nfederal government also provides services to veterans of the armed forces, and their \\nspouses and dependents, provided they use veterans’ health care facilities and providers \\n(see http://www.va.gov). \\nMedicare was established in 1965 to provide minimal health care coverage for the \\nelderly, anyone over the age of sixty-five. Medicare offers hospital (Part A), medical \\n(Part B), combined medical and hospital (Part C), and prescription coverage (Part D), as \\noutlined in Figure 10.11 \"Medicare Plans and Coverage\". \\nFigure 10.11 Medicare Plans and Coverage \\n \\nMedicare is really a combination of privately and publicly funded health care; the \\noptional services all require some premium paid by the insured. You may not need \\nMedicare’s supplemental plans if you have access to supplemental insurance provided \\nby your former employer or by membership in a union or professional organization. \\nMedicare does not cover all services. For example, it does not cover dental and vision \\ncare, private nursing care, unapproved nursing home care, care in a foreign country, and \\noptional or discretionary (unnecessary) care. \\nMedicare also determines the limits on payments for services, but physicians may \\ncharge more than that for their services (within limits determined by Medicare). You \\nwould be responsible for paying the difference. For these reasons, it is advisable to have \\nsupplemental insurance. \\nMarley thought she didn’t need to know anything about Medicare, being young, single, \\nand healthy, but then her sixty-six-year-old father developed a debilitating illness, \\nrequiring not only medical care but also assistance with many of his daily living \\nactivities. Suddenly, Marley was shouldering the responsibility of arranging her father’s \\ncare and devising a strategy for financing it. She quickly learned about the care and \\nlimits of coverage offered by various Medicare plans. \\nMedicaid was also established in 1965 to provide health care based on income \\neligibility. It is administered by each state following broad federal guidelines and is \\njointly financed by the state and federal government. This means that states differ \\n'),\n",

If someone is covered by both Medicaid \\nand Medicare, Medicaid pays for expenses not covered by Medicare, such as co-pays and \\ndeductibles. Together, Medicare and Medicaid pay about 60 percent of all nursing home \\ncosts.[5]  \\nLong-Term Care Insurance \\nLong-term care insurance is designed to insure your care should you be chronically \\nunable to care for yourself. “Care” refers not to medical care, but to care of “activities of \\ndaily living” (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, and mobility, which may \\nbe impaired due to physical or mental illness or injury. \\nLong-term care coverage is offered as either indemnity coverage or “expense-incurred” \\npolicies. With an indemnity policy, you will be paid a specified benefit amount per day \\nregardless of your costs incurred. With an “expense-incurred” policy, you will be \\nreimbursed for your actual expenses incurred. Both types of policies can have limits, \\neither for dollar amounts per day, week, or month or for number of days or years of \\ncoverage. Newer policies are designed as integrated policies, offering pooled benefits \\nand specifying a total dollar limit of benefits that may be used over an unspecified \\nperiod. \\nNeed for long-term care is anticipated in older age, although anyone of any age may \\nneed it. When you buy the policy, you may be far away from needing the coverage. For \\nthat reason, many policies offer benefit limits indexed to inflation, to account for cost \\nincreases that happen before you receive benefits. \\nThe cost of a long-term care policy varies with your age, coverage, policy features such \\nas inflation indexing, and current health. As with any insurance purchase, you should be \\nas informed as possible, comparing coverage and costs before buying. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Basic health care coverage is for physician expenses, surgical expenses, and hospital expenses; \\nmajor medical insurance extends basic insurance in case of serious illness or injury.  \\n• The insured’s responsibility for costs can be structured as \\no deductibles, \\no co-pays, \\no coinsurance. \\n• Health insurance is sold through private insurers, nonprofit service plans, and managed care \\norganizations, which may be structured as '),\n",

Explain the differences among variable, adjustable, and universal whole life policies and the use \\nof riders. \\n4. List the factors that determine the premiums for whole life policies.  \\nAs you have learned, assets such as a home or car should be protected from the risk of a \\nloss of value, because assets store wealth, so a loss of value is a loss of wealth. \\nYour health is also valuable, and the costs of repairing it in the case of accident or illness \\nare significant enough that it also requires insurance coverage. In addition, however, \\nyou may have an accident or illness that leaves you permanently impaired or even dead. \\nIn either case, your ability to earn income will be restricted or gone. Thus, your income \\nshould be insured, especially if you have dependents who would bear the consequences \\nof losing your income. Disability insurance and life insurance are ways of insuring your \\nincome against some limitations. \\nDisability Insurance \\nDisability insurance is designed to insure your income should you survive an injury \\nor illness impaired. The definition of “disability” is a variable feature of most policies. \\nSome define it as being unable to pursue your regular work, while others define it more \\nnarrowly as being unable to pursue any work. Some plans pay partial benefits if you \\nreturn to work part-time, and some do not. As always, you should understand the limits \\nof your plan’s coverage. \\nThe costs of disability insurance are determined by the features and/or conditions of the \\nplan, including the following: \\n• Waiting period \\n• Amount of benefits \\n• Duration of benefits \\n• Cause of disability \\n• Payments for loss of vision, hearing, speech, or use of limbs \\n• Inflation-adjusted benefits \\n• Guaranteed renewal or noncancelable clause \\nIn general, the greater the number of these features or conditions that apply, the higher \\nyour premium. \\nAll plans have a waiting period from the time of disability to the collection of benefits. \\nMost are between 30 and 90 days, but some are as long as 180 days. The longer the \\nwaiting period is, generally, the less the premium. \\nPlans also vary in the amount and duration of benefits. Benefits are usually offered as a \\npercent of your current wages or salary. The more the benefits or the longer the '),\n",

Some plans offer lifetime benefits, while \\nothers end benefits at age sixty-five (the age of Medicare eligibility). \\nIn addition, some plans offer benefits in the following cases, all of which carry higher \\npremiums: \\n• Disability due to accident or illness \\n• Loss of vision, hearing, speech, or the use of limbs, regardless of disability \\n• Benefits that automatically increase with the rate of inflation \\n• Guaranteed renewal, which insures against losing your coverage if your health \\ndeteriorates \\nYou may already have some disability insurance through your employer, although in \\nmany cases the coverage is minimal. You may also be eligible for Social Security benefits \\nfrom the federal government or workers’ compensation benefit from your state if the \\ndisability is due to an on-the-job accident. Other providers of disability benefits include \\nthe following: \\n• The Veterans’ Administration (if you are a veteran) \\n• Automobile insurance (if the disability is due to a car accident) \\n• Labor unions (if you are a member) \\n• Civil service provisions (if you are a government employee) \\nYou should know the coverage available to you and if you find it’s not adequate, \\nsupplement it with private disability insurance. \\nLife Insurance \\nLife insurance is a way of insuring that your income will continue after your death. If \\nyou have a spouse, children, parents, or siblings who are dependent on your income or \\ncare, your death would create new financial burdens for them. To avoid that, you can \\ninsure your dependents against your loss, at least financially. \\nThere are many kinds of life insurance policies. Before purchasing one, you should \\ndetermine what it is you want the insurance to accomplish for your survivors. What do \\nyou want it to do? \\n• Pay off the mortgage? \\n• Put your kids through college? \\n• Provide income so that your spouse can be home with the kids and not be forced \\nout into the workplace? \\n• Provide alternative care for your elderly parents or dependent siblings? \\n• Cover the costs of your medical expenses and funeral? \\n• Avoid estate taxes?

Your goals for your life insurance will determine how \\nmuch benefit you need and what kind of policy you need. Weighed against that are its \\ncosts— the amount of premium that you pay and how that fits into your current budget. \\nSam and Maggie have two children, ages three and five. Maggie works as a credit analyst \\nin a bank. Sam looks after the household and the children and Maggie’s elderly mother, \\nwho lives a couple of blocks away. He does her grocery shopping, cleans her apartment, \\ndoes her laundry, and runs any errands that she may need done. Sam and Maggie live in \\na condo they bought, financed with a mortgage. They have established college savings \\naccounts for each child, and they try to save regularly. \\nSam and Maggie need to insure both their lives, because the loss of either would cause \\nthe survivors financial hardship. With Maggie’s death, her earnings would be gone, \\nwhich is how they pay the mortgage and save for their children’s education. Insurance \\non her life should be enough to pay off the mortgage and fund their children’s college \\neducations, while providing for the family’s living expenses, unless Sam returns to the \\nworkforce. With Sam’s death, Maggie would have to hire someone to keep house and \\ncare for their children, and also someone to keep her mother’s house and provide care \\nfor her. Insurance on Sam’s life should be enough to maintain everyone’s quality of \\nliving. \\nTerm Insurance \\nMaggie’s income provides for three expenditures: the mortgage, education savings, and \\nliving expenses. While living expenses are an ongoing or permanent need, the mortgage \\npayment and the education savings are not: eventually, the mortgage will be paid off and \\nthe children educated. To cover permanent needs, Maggie and Sam should consider \\npermanent insurance, also known as whole life, straight life, or cash value insurance. \\nTo insure those two temporary goals of paying the mortgage and college tuitions, \\nMaggie and Sam could consider temporary or term insurance. \\nTerm insurance is insurance for a limited time period, usually one, five, ten, or twenty \\nyears. After that period, the coverage stops. It is used to cover financial needs for a \\nlimited time period— for example, to cover the balance due on a mortgage, or education \\ncosts. Premiums are lower for term insurance, because the coverage is limited. The \\npremium is based on the amount of coverage and the length of the time period covered. \\nA term insurance policy may have a renewability option, so that you can renew the \\npolicy at the end of its term, or it may have a conversion option, so that you can convert \\nit to a whole life policy and pay a higher premium. If it is multiyear level term or straight \\nterm, the premium will remain the same over the term of coverage. \\nDecreasing term insurance pays a decreasing benefit as the term progresses, which may \\nmake sense in covering the balance due on a mortgage, which also decreases with \\npayments over time. On the other hand, you could simply buy a one-year term policy '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  257 \\nwith a smaller benefit each year and have more flexibility should you decide to make a \\nchange. \\nA return-of-premium (ROP) term policy will return the premiums you have paid if you \\noutlive the term of the policy. On the other hand, the premiums on such policies are \\nhigher, and you may do better by simply buying the regular term policy and saving the \\ndifference between the premiums. \\nTerm insurance is a more affordable way to insure against a specific risk for a specific \\ntime. It is pure insurance, in that it provides risk shifting for a period of time, but unlike \\nwhole life, it does not also provide a way to save or invest. \\nWhole Life Insurance \\nWhole life insurance is permanent insurance. That is, you pay a specified premium until \\nyou die, at which time your specified benefit is paid to your beneficiary. The amount of \\nthe premium is determined by the amount of your benefit and your age and life \\nexpectancy when the policy is purchased. \\nUnlike term insurance, where your premiums simply pay for your coverage or risk \\nshifting, a whole life insurance policy has a cash surrender value or cash value that is \\nthe value you would receive if you canceled the policy before you die. You can “cash out” \\nthe policy and receive that cash value before you die. In that way, the whole life policy is \\nalso an investment vehicle; your premiums are a way of saving and investing, using the \\ninsurance company as your investment manager. Whole life premiums are more than \\nterm life premiums because you are paying not only to shift risk but also for investment \\nmanagement. \\nA variable life insurance policy has a minimum death benefit guaranteed, but the \\nactual death benefit can be higher depending on the investment returns that the policy \\nhas earned. In that case, you are shifting some risk, but also assuming some risk of the \\ninvestment performance. \\nAn adjustable life policy is one where you can adjust the amount of your benefit, and \\nyour premium, as your needs change. \\nA universal life policy offers flexible premiums and benefits. The benefit can be \\nincreased or decreased without canceling the policy and getting a new one (and thus \\nlosing the cash value, as in a basic whole life policy). Premiums are added to the policy’s \\ncash value, as are investment returns, while the insurer deducts the cost of insurance \\n(COI) and any other policy fees. \\nWhen purchased, universal life policies may be offered with a single premium payment, \\na fixed (and regular) premium payment until you die, or a flexible premium where you \\ncan determine the amount of each premium, so long as the cash value in the account can \\ncover the insurer’s COI.

When you purchase a term life policy, you purchase and pay \\nfor the insurance only. When you purchase a whole life policy, you purchase insurance \\nplus investment management. You pay more for that additional service, so its value \\nshould be greater than its cost (in additional premiums). Whole life policies take some \\nanalysis to figure out the real investment returns and fees, and the insurer is valuable to \\nyou only if it is a better investment manager than you could have otherwise. There are \\nmany choices for investment management. Thus, the additional cost of a whole life \\npolicy must be weighed against your choices among investment vehicles. If it’s better \\nthan your other choices, then you should buy the whole life. If not, then buy term life \\nand save or invest the difference in the premiums. \\nChoosing a Policy \\nAll life insurance policies have basic features, which then can be customized with a \\nriderA clause to a policy that adds specific benefits under specific conditions.— a clause \\nthat adds benefits under certain conditions. The standard features include provisions \\nthat protect the insured and beneficiaries in cases of missed premium payments, fraud, \\nor suicide. There are also loan provisions granted, so that you can borrow against the \\ncash value of a whole life policy. \\nRiders are actually extra insurance that you can purchase to cover less common \\ncircumstances. Commonly offered riders include \\n• a waiver of premium payment if the insured becomes completely disabled, \\n• a double benefit for accidental death, \\n• guaranteed insurability allowing you to increase your benefit without proof of \\ngood health, \\n• cost of living protection that protects your benefit from inflation, \\n'),\n",

The three common options are \\n• as a lump sum, paid out all at once; \\n• in installments, paid out over a specified period; \\n• as interest payments, so that a series of interest payments is made to the \\nbeneficiaries until a specified time when the benefit itself is paid out. \\nYou would choose the various options depending on your beneficiaries and their \\nanticipated needs. Understanding these features, riders, and options can help you to \\nidentify the appropriate insurance product for your situation. As with any purchase, \\nonce you have identified the product, you need to identify the market and the financing. \\nMany insurers offer many insurance products, usually sold through brokers or agents. \\nAgents are paid on commission, based on the amount of insurance they sell. A captive \\nagent sells the insurance of only one company, while an independent agent sells policies \\nfrom many insurers. You want a licensed agent that is responsive and will answer \\nquestions patiently and professionally. If you die, this may be the person on whom your \\nsurvivors will have to depend to help them receive their benefits in a troubling time. \\nYou will have to submit an application for a policy and may be required to have a \\nphysical exam or release medical records to verify your physical condition. Factors that \\ninfluence your riskiness are your family medical history, age and weight, and lifestyle \\nchoices such as smoking, drinking, and drug use. Your risks will influence the amount of \\nyour premiums. \\nHaving analyzed the product and the market, you need to be sure that the premium \\npayments are sustainable for you, that you can add the expense in your operating budget \\nwithout creating a budget deficit. \\nLife Insurance as a Financial Planning Decision \\nUnlike insuring property and health, life insurance can combine two financial planning \\nfunctions: shifting risk and saving to build wealth. The decision to buy life insurance \\ninvolves thinking about your choices for both and your opportunity cost in doing so. \\nLife insurance is about insuring your earnings even after your death. You can create \\nearnings during your lifetime by selling labor or capital. Your death precludes your \\nselling labor or earning income from salary or wages, but if you have assets that can also \\nearn income, they may be able to generate some or even enough income to insure the \\ncontinued comfort of your dependents, even without your salary or wages.

In that case, you will \\nneed less income protection and less life insurance. Besides life insurance, another way \\nto protect your beneficiaries is to accumulate a large enough asset base with a large \\nenough earning potential. \\nIf you can afford the life insurance premiums, then the money that you will pay in \\npremiums is currently part of your budget surplus and is being saved somehow. If it is \\ncurrently contributing to your children’s education savings or to your retirement plan, \\nyou will have to weigh the value of protecting current income against insuring your \\nchildren’s education or your future income in retirement. Or that surplus could be used \\ntoward generating that larger asset base. \\nThese are tough decisions to weigh because life is risky. If you never have an accident or \\nillness and simply go through life earning plenty and paying off your mortgage and \\nsaving for retirement and educating your children, then are all those insurance \\npremiums just wasted? No. Since your financial strategy includes accumulating assets \\nand earning income to satisfy your needs now or in the future, you need to protect those \\nassets and income, at least by shifting the risk of losing them through a chance accident. \\nAt the same time, you must make risk-shifting decisions in the context of your other \\nfinancial goals and decisions. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Disability insurance insures your income against an accident or illness that leaves your earning \\nability impaired. \\n• Disability insurance coverage and costs vary. \\n• Life insurance is designed to protect dependents against the loss of your income in the event of \\nyour death. \\n• Term insurance provides life insurance coverage for a specified period of time.  \\n• Whole life insurance provides life insurance coverage until the insured’s death. \\n• Whole life insurance has a cash surrender value and thus can be used as an investment \\ninstrument as well as a way of shifting risk. \\n• Variable, adjustable, and universal life policies offer more flexibility of benefits and premiums.  \\n• Riders provide more specific coverage. \\n• Premiums are determined by the choice of benefits and riders and the risk of the insured, as \\nassessed by medical history and lifestyle choices. \\nEXERCISES  '),\n",

Insuring what you have means \\nfinding the best way to protect it. Retirement planning, on the other hand, means \\nfinding the best way to protect the life that you’d like to be living after you stop earning \\nincome from employment. Estate planning involves protecting what you have even after \\nyour death. So retirement planning and estate planning are plans to create and then \\nprotect an accumulation of wealth. \\nBoth types of planning also ask you to ask some of the following questions that you \\nreally can’t answer: \\n• What will my life be like when I retire? \\n• Will I have a spouse or partner? \\n• Dependents? \\n• A home? \\n• A mortgage? \\n• Will I be disabled? \\n• Where will I live? \\n• What will I do? \\n• What would I like to do? \\n• When I die, will I have a taxable estate? \\nPlanning, especially for retirement, should start as early as possible, allowing the most \\ntime for savings to occur and accrue. Ironically, that’s when it is hardest to try to \\nimagine answers to these questions. Understanding the practical means to planning and \\nsaving for retirement can help you get started. If your plans are flexible, they can adapt \\nto the unexpected as it happens, which it inevitably will. \\n11.1 Retirement Planning: Projecting Needs '),\n",

Calculate relationships between the annual savings required and the time to retirement.  \\nRetirement planning involves the same steps as any other personal planning: figure out \\nwhere you’d like to be and then figure out how to get there from where you are. More \\nformally, the first step is to define your goals, even if they are no more specific than “I \\nwant to be able to afford a nice life after I stop getting a paycheck.” But what is a “nice \\nlife,” and how will you pay for it? \\nIt may seem impossible or futile to try to project your retirement needs so far from \\nretirement given that there are so many uncertainties in life and retirement may be far \\naway. But that shouldn’t keep you from saving. You can try to save as much as possible \\nfor now, with the idea that your plans will clarify as you get closer to your retirement, so \\nwhatever money you have saved will give you a head start. \\nChris and Sam were young urban professionals until their children were born.

They are \\nhappy to provide a more idyllic lifestyle for their kids but miss the “buzz” and \\nconvenience of their urban lifestyle. When their children are on their own and Chris and \\nSam are ready to retire, they would like to sell their home and move back into the city. \\nChris and Sam are planning to use the value of their house to finance a condo in the city, \\nbut they also know that real estate prices are often higher in the more desirable urban \\nareas and that living expenses may be higher in the future. Now in their midthirties, \\nChris and Sam are planning to retire in thirty years. \\nChris and Sam need to project how much money they will need to have saved by the \\ntime they wish to retire. To do that, they need to project both their future capital needs \\n(to buy the condo) and their future living expense in retirement. They also need to \\nproject how long they may live after retirement, or how many years’ worth of living \\nexpenses they will need, so that they won’t outlive their savings. \\nThey know that they have thirty years over which to save this money. They also know, as \\nexplained in Chapter 4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\", that time affects \\nvalue. Thus, Sam and Chris need to project the rate of compounding for their savings, or \\nthe rate at which time will affect the value of their money. \\nTo estimate required savings, in other words, you need to estimate the following: \\n• Expenses in retirement \\n• The duration of retirement \\n• The return on savings in retirement '),\n",

Given that over the long run, inflation affects the purchasing power of your \\nincome, you factor in the effect inflation may have so that your purchasing power \\nremains the same. \\nFor example, say your living expenses are around $25,000 per year and you’d like to \\nhave that amount of purchasing power in retirement as well. Assuming your costs of \\nliving remain constant, if you are thirty years from retirement, how much will you be \\nspending on living expenses then? \\nThe overall average annual rate of inflation in the United States is about 3.25 percent,[1]  \\nso you would have to spend $25,000 × (1 + 0.0325)30 = $65,269 per year to maintain \\nyour standard of living thirty years from now. Put another way, thirty years from now, \\none dollar will buy only about thirty-eight cents worth of today’s expenses. This \\ncalculation comes from the relationship of time and value, studied in Chapter 4 \\n\"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\". In this case, $25,000 is the present value \\nof your expenses, and you are looking for the future value, given that your expenses will \\nappreciate at a rate of 3.25 percent per year for thirty years. \\nAs you can see, you would need about two-and-a-half times your current spending just \\nto live the life you live now. Fortunately, your savings won’t be just “sitting there” during \\nthat time. They, too, will be compounding to keep up with your needs. \\nYou may use your current expenses as a basis to project a more or less expensive \\nlifestyle after retirement. You may anticipate expenses dropping with fewer household \\nmembers and dependents, for example, after your children have grown. Or you may \\nwish to spend more and live a more comfortable life, doing things you’ve always wanted \\nto do. In any case, your current level of spending can be a starting point for your \\nestimates. \\nEstimating Length of Retirement \\nHow much you need to have saved to support your annual living expenses after \\nretirement depends on how long those expenses continue or how long you’ll live after \\nretirement. In the United States, life expectancy at age sixty-five has increased \\ndramatically in the last century, from twelve to seventeen years for males and from \\ntwelve to twenty years for females, due to increased access to health care, medical \\nadvances, and healthier lives before age sixty-five.[2]  '),\n",

Your annual expenses in retirement are really a series of cash flows that \\nwill grow by the rate of inflation. At the same time, your savings will grow by your rate of \\nreturn, even after you are making withdrawals to cover your expenses. \\nSay that when you retire, you have your retirement funds invested so they are earning a \\nreturn of 5 percent per year. Assume an annual inflation rate of 3.25 percent and that \\nyour annual expenses when you retire are $65,269 (as adjusted for inflation in the \\nexample above). \\nFigure 11.3 \"Estimating Annual Expenses and Savings Needed at Retirement\" shows \\nwhat your situation would look like. \\n'),\n",

While you are retired, you will be drawing income from your savings, but your \\nremaining savings will still be earning a return. The more return your savings can earn \\nwhile you are retired, the less you have to have saved by retirement. The less return your \\nsavings can earn in retirement, the more you need to have saved before retirement. \\nIn Figure 11.3 \"Estimating Annual Expenses and Savings Needed at Retirement\", the \\ntotal amount needed at retirement is only about $1.5 million if your remaining savings \\nwill earn 5 percent while you are retired, but if that rate of return is only 2 percent, you \\nwould have to begin retirement with almost $2.5 million. \\n'),\n",

If you want to have $1,590,289 in \\nthirty years when you retire, you could deposit $367,957 today and just let it compound \\nfor thirty years without a withdrawal. But if you plan to make an annual investment in \\nyour retirement savings, how much would that have to be? \\nEstimating the Annual Savings for Retirement \\nIn the example above, if you make regular annual deposits into your retirement account \\nfor the next thirty years, each deposit would have to be $23,936, assuming that your \\naccount will earn 5 percent for in thirty years. If the rate of return for your savings is \\nless, you would have to save more to have more at retirement. If your retirement savings \\ncan earn only 2 percent, for example, you would have to deposit $60,229 per year to \\nhave $2,443,361 when you retire. Your retirement account grows through your \\ncontributions and through its own earnings. The more your account can earn before you \\nretire, the less you will have to contribute to it. On the other hand, the more you can \\ncontribute to it, the less it has to earn. \\nThe time you have to save until retirement can make a big difference to the amount you \\nmust save every year. The longer the time you have to save, the less you have to save \\neach year to reach your goal. Figure 11.4 \"Time to Retirement and Annual Savings \\nRequired\" shows this idea as applied to the example above, assuming a 5 percent return \\non savings and a goal of $1,590,289. \\nFigure 11.4 Time to Retirement and Annual Savings Required \\n \\nThe longer the time you have to save, the sooner you start saving, and the less you need \\nto save each year.

Had they started in their twenties and had forty years \\nuntil retirement, they would not have to save so much each year. If they wait until they \\nare around fifty, they will have to save a lot more each year. The more you have to save, \\nthe less disposable income you will have to spend on current living expenses, making it \\nharder to save. Clearly, saving early and regularly is the superior strategy. \\nWhen you make these calculations, be aware that you are using estimates to figure the \\nmoney you’ll need at retirement.

Identify retirement plans for the self-employed. \\nWhile knowing the numbers clarifies the picture of your needs, you must reconcile that \\npicture with the realities that you face now. How will you be able to afford to save what \\nyou need for retirement? \\nThere are several savings plans structured to help you save— some offer tax advantages, \\nsome don’t— but first you need to make a commitment to save. \\nSaving means not spending a portion of your disposable income. It means delaying \\ngratification or putting off until tomorrow what you could have today. That is often \\ndifficult, as you have many demands on your disposable income. You must weigh the \\nbenefit of fulfilling those demands with the cost of not saving for retirement, even \\nthough benefit in the present is much easier to credit than benefit in the future. Once \\nyou resolve to save, however, employer, government, and individual retirement plans \\nare there to help you. \\nEmployer Retirement Accounts \\nEmployers may sponsor pension or retirement plans for their employees as part of the \\nemployees’ total compensation. There are two kinds of employer-sponsored plans: \\ndefined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. \\nA defined benefit plan is a retirement plan, sometimes called a pension plan, \\nfunded by the employer, who promises the employee a specific benefit upon retirement. \\nThe employer can be a corporation, labor union, government, or other organization that '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 269}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  270 \\nestablishes a retirement plan for its employees. In addition to (or instead of) a defined \\nbenefit plan, an employer may also offer a profit-sharing plan, a stock bonus plan, an \\nemployee stock ownership plan (ESOP), a thrift plan, or other plan. Each type of plans \\nhas advantages and disadvantages for employers and employees, but all are designed to \\ngive employees a way to save for the future and employers a way to attract and keep \\nemployees. \\nThe payout for a defined benefit plan is usually an annual or monthly payment for the \\nremainder of the employee’s life. In some defined benefit plans, there is also a spousal \\nor survivor’s benefit. The amount of the benefit is determined by your wages and length \\nof service with the company. \\nMany defined benefit plans are structured with a vesting option that limits your claim \\non the retirement fund until you have been with the company for a certain length of \\ntime. For example, Paul’s employer has a defined benefit plan that provides for Paul to \\nbe 50 percent vested after five years and fully vested after seven years. If Paul were to \\nleave the company before he had worked there for five years, none of his retirement \\nfund would be in his account. If he left after six years, half his fund would be kept for \\nhim; after ten years, all of it would be. \\nWith a defined benefit plan your income in retirement is constant or “fixed,” and it is the \\nemployer’s responsibility to fund your retirement. This is both an advantage and a \\ndisadvantage for the employee. Having your employer fund the plan is an advantage, but \\nhaving a fixed income in retirement is a drawback during periods of inflation when the \\npurchasing power of each dollar declines. In some plans, that drawback is offset by \\nautomatic cost of living increases. \\nDefined benefit plans also carry some risk. Most companies reserve the right to change \\nor discontinue their pension plans. Furthermore, the pension payout is only as good as \\nthe company that pays it. If the company defaults, its pension obligations may be \\ncovered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), an independent \\nfederal government agency. If not, employees are left without the benefit. Even if the \\ncompany is insured, the PGBC may not cover 100 percent of employees’ benefits. \\nFounded in 1974, the PBGC is funded by insurance premiums paid by employers who \\nsponsor defined benefit plans. If a pension plan ends (e.g., through the employer’s \\nbankruptcy) the PBGC assumes pensions payments up to a limit per employee. \\nCurrently, the PBGC pays benefits to approximately 640,000 retirees and insures the \\npensions of about 1,305,000 employees.[1]  \\nThere is some concern, however, that if too many defined benefit sponsors fail, as could \\nhappen in a widespread recession, the PBGC would not be able to fully fund its \\nobligations. \\nTo avoid the responsibility for employee retirement funds, more and more employers \\nsponsor defined contribution retirement plans. Under defined contribution plans, \\neach employee has a retirement account, and both the employee and the employer may '),\n",

The employer may contribute up to a percentage limit or offer \\nto match the employee’s contributions, up to a limit. With a matching contribution, if \\nemployees choose not to contribute, they lose the opportunity of having the employer’s \\ncontribution as well as their own. The employee makes untaxed contributions to the \\naccount as a payroll deduction, up to a maximum limit specified by the tax code. The \\nmaximum for defined contribution plans is 25 percent of the employee’s compensation, \\nwith a cap in 2009 of $49,000. Defined contribution plans known as 401(k) plans had a \\nmaximum contribution limit in 2009 of $16,500. \\nDefined contribution plans have become increasingly popular since section 401(k) was \\nintroduced into the tax code in 1978. The 401(k) plans— or 403b plans for employees \\nof nonprofits and 457 plans for employees of government organizations— offer \\nemployees a pretax (or tax-deferred) way to save for retirement to which employers can \\nmake a tax-deductible contribution. \\nThe advantages of a 401(k) for the employee are the plan’s flexibility and portability and \\nthe tax benefit. A defined contribution account belongs to the employee and can go with \\nthe employee when he or she leaves that employer. For the employer, there is the lower \\ncost and the opportunity to shift the risk of investing funds onto the employee. There is \\na ceiling on the employer’s costs: either a limited matching contribution or a limit set by \\nthe tax code. \\nThe employer offers a selection of investments, but the employee chooses how the funds \\nin his or her account are diversified and invested. Thus, the employee assumes the \\nresponsibility— and risk— for investment returns. The employer’s contributions are a \\nbenefit to the employee. Employers can also make a contribution with company stock, \\nwhich can create an undiversified account. A portfolio consisting only of your company’s \\nstock exposes you to market risk should the company not do well, in which case, you \\nmay find yourself losing both your job and your retirement account’s value. \\nU.S. Government’s Retirement Account \\nThe federal government offers a mandatory retirement plan for all citizens except \\nfederal government employees and railroad workers, known as Social Security. Social \\nSecurity is funded by a mandatory payroll tax shared by employee and employer. That \\ntax, commonly referred to as Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), also funds \\nMedicare (see Chapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: Insurance\"). Social Security was \\nsigned into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 to provide benefits for old \\nage and survivors and disability insurance for workers (OASDI). The Social Security \\nAdministration (SSA) was established to manage these “safety nets.” \\nFigure 11.6 President Franklin D.

Roosevelt, August 14, 1935[3]  \\nData provided by the SSA show that almost 51,500,000 beneficiaries receive an average \\nmonthly benefit of $1,057. The federal government’s total annual payment of benefits \\ntotals $653 billion. Most of the beneficiaries are retirees (63.6 percent) or their spouses \\nand children (5.7 percent), but there are also survivors, widows, and orphans receiving \\nabout 12.6 percent of benefits and disabled workers, spouses, and children receiving \\napproximately 18.3 percent of benefits.[4]  \\nSocial Security is not an automatic benefit but an entitlement. To qualify for benefits, \\nyou must work and contribute FICA taxes for forty quarters (ten years). Retirement \\nbenefits may be claimed as early as age sixty-two, but full benefits are not available until \\nage sixty-seven for workers born in 1960 or later. If you continue to earn wage income \\nafter you begin collecting Social Security but before you reach full retirement age, your \\nbenefit may be reduced. Once you reach full retirement age, your benefit will not be \\nreduced by additional wage income. \\nThe amount of your benefit is calculated based on the amount of FICA tax paid during \\nyour working life and your age at retirement. Up to 85 percent of individual Social \\nSecurity benefits may be taxable, depending on other sources of income.[5]  \\nEach year, the SSA provides each potential, qualified beneficiary with a projection of the \\nexpected monthly benefit amount (in current dollars) for that individual based on the \\nindividual’s wage history. \\nSocial Security benefits represent a large expenditure by the federal government, and so \\nthe program is often the subject of debate.

Some of these proposals are based on economics, some on politics, and some on \\nsocial philosophy. Despite its critics, Social Security remains a popular program on \\nwhich many Americans have come to rely. You should, however, be aware that Social \\nSecurity can be amended and faces possible underfunding. \\nKeep in mind that in 1935 when Social Security was created, life expectancy for \\nAmerican males was only sixty-five, the age of Social Security eligibility. Social Security \\nwas never meant to be a retirement income, but rather a supplement to retirement \\nincome, merely “some measure of protection against…poverty-ridden old age.”[6]  \\nAs part of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), the U.S. government also \\noffers special retirement plans to its employees, including a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) \\nfor civilians employed by the United States and members of the uniformed services (i.e., \\nArmy, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \\nAdministration, and Public Health Service). \\nFederal, state, and local government plans; plans for public school teachers and \\nadministrators; and church plans are exempt from the rules of the Employee Retirement \\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and from some rules that govern retirement plans \\nof private employers under the Internal Revenue Code. In some states, public school \\nteachers pay into a state retirement system and do not pay federal Social Security taxes \\n(or receive Social Security benefits) for the years they are working as teachers. \\nNevertheless, many plans for public employees are defined benefit plans providing \\nannuities upon retirement, similar to but separate from plans for employees in the \\nprivate sector. \\nIndividual Retirement Accounts \\nAny individual can save for retirement without a special “account,” but since the \\ngovernment would like to encourage retirement savings, it has created tax-advantaged \\naccounts to help you do so. Because these accounts provide tax benefits as well as some \\nconvenience, it is best to use them first in planning for retirement, although their use \\nmay be limited. \\nIndividual retirement accounts (IRAs) were created in 1974 by ERISA. They were \\ninitially available only to employees not covered by an employer’s retirement plan. In \\n1981, participation was amended to include everyone under the age of 70.5.[7]  '),\n",

Deductible contributions are taxed later as funds are withdrawn, but \\nnondeductible contributions are not. In other words, you either pay tax on the money as \\nyou put it in, or you pay tax on it as you take it out. \\nA great advantage of a Traditional IRA is that principal appreciation (interest, dividend \\nincome, or capital gain) is not taxed until the funds are withdrawn. Withdrawals may \\nbegin without penalty after the age of 59.5. Funds may be withdrawn before age 59.5, \\nbut with penalties and taxes applied. Contributions may be made until age 70.5, at \\nwhich time required minimum distributions (withdrawals) of funds must begin. \\nBecause they create tax advantages, contributions to a Traditional IRA are limited, \\ncurrently up to $5,000 (or $6,000 for someone over the age of fifty). That limit on \\ndeductible contributions becomes smaller (the tax benefit is phased out) as income \\nrises. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides a worksheet to calculate how much of \\nyour contribution is taxable with your personal income tax return (Form 1040). \\nFor the Roth IRA, created in 1997, contributions are not tax deductible, but \\nwithdrawals are not taxed. You can continue to contribute at any age, and you do not \\nhave to take any minimum required distribution. The great advantage of a Roth IRA is \\nthat capital appreciation is not taxed. \\nAs with the Traditional IRA, contributions may be limited depending on your income. If \\nyou have both a Traditional and a Roth IRA, you may contribute to both, but your \\ncombined contribution is limited. \\nFigure 11.9 \"Differences between the Traditional and the Roth IRAs\" is an adaptation of \\na guide provided by the IRS to the key differences between a Traditional and a Roth \\nIRA.[8]  \\nFigure 11.9 Differences between the Traditional and the Roth IRAs '),\n",

Identify the purposes, types, and components of a will. \\n2. Describe the roles and types of trusts and gifts. \\n3. Analyze the role of the estate tax in estate planning. \\nYour estate includes everything you own. Other aspects of financial planning involve \\ncreating and managing your assets while you are alive. Estate planning is a way to \\nmanage your assets after your death. Age is not really a factor, because death can occur \\nat any time, at any age, by any cause. Arranging for the disposition of your estate is not a \\nmorbid concern but a kindness to those you leave behind. Death is a legal and financial \\nevent— and in some cases a taxable event— as well as an emotional one. Your loved ones \\nwill have to deal with the emotional aftermath of your loss and will appreciate your care \\nin planning for the legal and financial outcomes of your death. \\nWills \\nSince you won’t be here, you will need to leave a written document outlining your \\ninstructions regarding your estate. That is your will, your legal request for the \\ndistribution of your estate, that is, assets that remain after your debts have been \\nsatisfied. If you die intestate, or without a will, the laws of your state of legal residence \\nwill dictate the distribution of your estate. \\nYou can write your own will so long as you are a legal adult and mentally competent. \\nThe document has to be witnessed by two or three people who are not inheriting \\nanything under the terms of the will, and it must be dated and signed and, in some \\nstates, notarized. A holographic will is handwritten; it may be more difficult to \\nvalidate. A statutory will is a preprinted will that you can buy from a store or in a \\nsoftware package. Consider, however, that a will is a legal document. Having yours \\ndrawn up by a lawyer may better insure its completeness and validity in court. \\nProbate is the legal process of validating a will and administering the payment of debts \\nand the distribution of assets by a probate court. Probate courts also distribute property \\nin the absence of a will. Probate is not required in every case, however. Probate is not \\nrequired if the deceased \\n• owned assets of little value, allowing for transfer without court supervision; \\n• owned assets jointly with or “payable on death” to another person; '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 278}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  279 \\n• owned assets naming another person as beneficiary; \\n• held all assets in a living trust (a legal entity for managing assets on behalf of \\nbeneficiaries). \\nBesides the details of “who gets what,” a will should name an executor, the person or \\npersons who will administer the payment of your debts and the distribution of your \\nremaining assets, according to your wishes as expressed in your will. If you have legal \\ndependents, your will should name a guardian for them. You may also include a “letter \\nof last instruction” stating the location of important documents, safe deposit keys, and \\nbank accounts and specifying your funeral arrangements. \\nThere are several types of wills. A simple will leaves everything to a spouse. For \\ncomparatively small estates that are not taxable (e.g., estates with assets under a million \\ndollars in value), a simple will may be the most appropriate kind. A \\ntraditional marital share will leaves one-half of the estate to a spouse and the other \\nhalf to others, usually children. This may lower any tax burden on your estate and your \\nspouse’s. \\nA stated dollar amount will allows you to leave specific amounts to beneficiaries. A \\ndrawback of this type of will is that the stated amounts may be reasonable when your \\nwill is drawn up but may not reflect your intentions at the time of your death, perhaps \\nmany years later. For that reason, rather than specifying specific amounts, it may be \\nbetter to specify percentages of your asset values you would like each beneficiary to \\nhave. \\nYou may change or rewrite your will at any time, but you should definitely do so as your \\nlife circumstances change, especially with events such as marriage or divorce, the birth \\nof a child, and the acquisition of significant assets, such as a house. If the changes in \\nyour circumstances are substantial, you should create a new will. \\nIt is possible that you will become mentally or physically disabled before you die and \\nunable to direct management of your assets. To prepare for this possibility, you may \\ncreate a living will with instructions for your care in that event. You may appoint \\nsomeone— usually a spouse, child, or sibling— who would have power of attorney, \\nthat is, the right to act on your behalf, especially as regards financial and legal decisions. \\nThat power may be limited or unlimited (such as a “durable power of attorney”) and is \\nrestricted to certain acts or dependent on certain circumstances. \\nAlong with granting power of attorney, your living will may include a health care proxy, \\nrequesting that medical personnel follow the instructions of a designated family \\nmember who expresses your wishes concerning your end-of-life treatment. Many people \\nrequest, for example, that they not be revived or sustained if they cannot experience \\nsome quality of life. Be sure to update your living will, however, as over time your views \\nmay change and as medical and technological advances change our notions of “quality of \\nlife.” '),\n",

A \\ntestamentary trust may be established by a will so that beneficiaries who are unable \\nto manage assets (minor children or disabled dependents) can benefit from the assets \\nbut have them managed for them. A living trust is established while the grantor is \\nalive. Unlike a will, it does not become a matter of public record upon your death. A \\nrevocable living trust can be revoked by the grantor, who remains the owner of the \\nassets, at any time. Such a trust avoids the probate process but may not shield assets \\nfrom estate taxes. An irrevocable living trust cannot be changed; the grantor gives \\nup ownership of his or her assets, which passes to the trust, avoiding probate and estate \\ntaxes. However, the trust then becomes a separate taxable entity and pays tax on its \\naccumulated income. \\nAnother way to avoid probate and estate taxes is to gift assets to your beneficiaries while \\nyou are alive. Ownership of the assets passes to the beneficiaries at the time of the gift, \\nso the assets are no longer included in your estate. The federal government and many \\nstate governments levy a gift tax for gifts exceeding certain limits. In 2009, the annual \\nexclusion from federal tax was $13,000 per recipient, for example. Also, the federal \\ngovernment does not tax gifts to spouses and to pay others’ medical bills or tuitions. \\nThere are limits to this kind of tax-free distribution of funds, however. For example, the \\nfederal government considers any “gift” you make within three years prior to your death \\nas part of your taxable estate. Gifting nevertheless is a way to reduce the value of an \\nestate. Some parents also prefer to make funds available or to gift them to their children \\nwhen the children need them more— for example, earlier in their adult lives when they \\nmay not have accrued enough wealth to make a down payment on a house. \\nMost trusts, whether testamentary or living, revocable or irrevocable, are created to \\navoid either the probate process or estate taxes or both. The probate process can be long \\nand costly and therefore a burden for your executor, your beneficiaries (who may have \\nto wait for their distributions), and your estate. \\nEstate Taxes \\nEstate taxes diminish the value of your estate that will be distributed to your \\nbeneficiaries. For that reason, one of the purposes of estate planning is to try to \\nminimize those taxes. \\nThe federal estate tax is “a tax on your right to transfer property at your death.”[1]  \\nIn 2009, you are required to file an estate tax return if the taxable estate is valued at \\n$3,500,000 or more. In states with estate taxes, you must file a return if the taxable \\nestate value is more than $1,000,000 or other similar cutoff amount. (For various '),\n",

The tax law defines the \\ngross estate as the following: \\n• The value of all property in which you had an ownership interest at the time of \\ndeath \\n• Life insurance proceeds payable to your estate or, if you owned the policy, to your \\nheirs \\n• The value of certain annuities payable to your estate or your heirs \\n• The value of certain property you transferred within three years before your \\ndeath[2]  \\nAllowable deductions include debts that you owed at the time of death, including \\nmortgage debt, your funeral expenses, the value of property passing directly to your \\nsurviving spouse (the marital deduction), charitable gifts, and the state estate tax.[3]  \\nFigure 11.12 \"Estate Tax Filings in 2007\" shows the scope of the estate tax in the U.S. \\neconomy for 2007, the latest year for which data is available. \\nFigure 11.12 Estate Tax Filings in 2007 \\n \\nIn the United States, with a total population of more than 306 million people, those \\n17,416 tax returns represent about 0.0057 percent of the population, paying about \\n0.9393 percent of the total taxes collected by the IRS in 2007.[4]  \\nWhile estate taxes tax your assets in your estate, inheritance taxes tax your assets in the \\nhands of your beneficiaries. Because of the costs involved, beneficiaries potentially may \\nnot be able to afford to inherit or preserve wealth within the family. For this reason and \\nothers, many states have redefined or repealed their inheritance tax laws. \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 281}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  282 \\nEstate taxes also can be more costly to beneficiaries if assets are not liquid— for example, \\nif a large portion of the value of your taxable estate is in your home or business. Your \\nsurvivors may be required to liquidate or sell assets just to pay the estate taxes. To avoid \\nthat, some estate plans include purchasing a life insurance policy for the anticipated \\namount of the estate tax, thus providing a source of liquid funds or cash for tax \\npayment. \\nMinimizing taxes owed is a goal of estate planning, but not the only goal. Your primary \\nobjective is to see that your dependents are provided for by the distribution of your \\nassets and that your assets are distributed as you would wish were you still there to \\ndistribute them yourself. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• A will describes your wishes for the distribution of your assets (the estate) after your death.  \\n• Probate courts distribute assets in the absence of a will and administer wills in estates with assets \\nvalued above a certain (variable) dollar amount. \\n• There are many kinds of wills, including \\no the simple will, \\no the traditional marital share will, \\no the stated dollar amount will. \\n• Living wills, with power of attorney and health care proxy, provide medical directives, empower \\nsomeone to manage your estate while you are still alive, and authorize someone to make decision \\nabout your health and end-of-life care. \\n• Trusts are used to provide the benefits of assets for beneficiaries without them assuming \\nresponsibility for asset management. \\n• There are testamentary and living trusts, revocable and irrevocable trusts. Setting up and \\nadministering trusts involves some considerable expense. \\n• Creating trusts and giving gifts are ways to reduce the taxable value of an estate.  \\n• Estate planning should try to minimize the federal and state tax obligations of estate disposition.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

When people have too much money to spend \\nimmediately, that is, a surplus of disposable income, they become savers or investors. \\nThey transfer their surplus to individuals, companies, or governments that have a \\nshortage or too little money to meet immediate needs. This is almost always done \\nthrough an intermediary— a bank or broker— who can match up the surpluses and the \\nshortages. If the capital markets work well, those who need money can get it, and those \\nwho can defer their need can try to profit from that. When you invest, you are \\ntransferring capital to those who need it on the assumption that they will be able to \\nreturn your capital when you need or want it and that they will also pay you for its use in \\nthe meantime. \\nInvesting happens over your lifetime. In your early adult years, you typically have little \\nsurplus to invest. Your first investments are in your home (although primarily financed \\nwith the debt of your mortgage) and then perhaps in planning for children’s education \\nor for your retirement. \\nAfter a period of just paying the bills, making the mortgage, and trying to put something \\naway for retirement, you may have the chance to accumulate wealth. Your income \\nincreases as your career progresses. You have fewer dependents (as children leave \\nhome), so your expenses decrease. You begin to think about your investment options. \\nYou have already been investing— in your home and retirement— but those investments \\nhave been prescribed by their specific goals. \\nYou may reach this stage earlier or later in your life, but at some point, you begin to \\nthink beyond your immediate situation and look to increase your real wealth and to your \\nfuture financial health. Investing is about that future. \\n12.1 Investments and Markets: A Brief Overview \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify the features and uses of issuing, owning, and trading bonds.  \\n2.

Understanding \\nhow markets work, how different investments work, and how different investors can use \\ninvestments is critical to understanding how to begin to plan your investment goals and \\nstrategies. \\nYou have looked at using the money markets to save surplus cash for the short term. \\nInvesting is primarily about using the capital markets to invest surplus cash for the \\nlonger term. As in the money markets, when you invest in the capital markets, you are \\nselling liquidity. \\nThe capital markets developed as a way for buyers to buy liquidity. In Western Europe, \\nwhere many of our ideas of modern finance began, those early buyers were usually \\nmonarchs or members of the nobility, raising capital to finance armies and navies to \\nconquer or defend territories or resources. Many devices and markets were used to raise \\ncapital,[1]  \\nbut the two primary methods that have evolved into modern times are the bond and \\nstock markets. (Both are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 15 \"Owning Stocks\" and \\nChapter 16 \"Owning Bonds\", but a brief introduction is provided here to give you the \\nbasic idea of what they are and how they can be used as investments.) \\nIn the United States, 47 percent of the adult population owns stocks or bonds, most \\nthrough retirement accounts.[2]  \\nBonds and Bond Markets \\nBonds are debt. The bond issuer borrows by selling a bond, promising the buyer \\nregular interest payments and then repayment of the principal at maturity. If a company \\nwants to borrow, it could just go to one lender and borrow. But if the company wants to \\nborrow a lot, it may be difficult to find any one investor with the capital and the \\ninclination to make large a loan, taking a large risk on only one borrower. In this case \\nthe company may need to find a lot of lenders who will each lend a little money, and this \\nis done through selling bonds. \\nA bond is a formal contract to repay borrowed money with interest (often referred to as \\nthe coupon) at fixed intervals. Corporations and governments (e.g., federal, state, \\nmunicipal, and foreign) borrow by issuing bonds. The interest rate on the bond may be a \\nfixed interest rate or a floating interest rate that changes as underlying interest \\nrates— rates on debt of comparable companies— change. (Underlying interest rates \\ninclude the prime rate that banks charge their most trustworthy borrowers and the \\ntarget rates set by the Federal Reserve Bank.) \\nThere are many features of bonds other than the principal and interest, such as the \\nissue price (the price you pay to buy the bond when it is first issued) and the \\nmaturity date (when the issuer of the bond has to repay you). Bonds may also be '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 286}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  287 \\n“callable”: redeemable before maturity (paid off early). Bonds may also be issued \\nwith various covenants or conditions that the borrower must meet to protect the \\nbondholders, the lenders. For example, the borrower, the bond issuer, may be required \\nto keep a certain level of cash on hand, relative to its short-term debts, or may not be \\nallowed to issue more debt until this bond is paid off. \\nBecause of the diversity and flexibility of bond features, the bond markets are not as \\ntransparent as the stock markets; that is, the relationship between the bond and its price \\nis harder to determine. The U.S. bond market is now more than twice the size (in dollars \\nof capitalization) of all the U.S. stock exchanges combined, with debt of more than $27 \\ntrillion by the end of 2007.[3]  \\nU.S. Treasury bonds are auctioned regularly to banks and large institutional investors by \\nthe Treasury Department, but individuals can buy U.S. Treasury bonds directly from the \\nU.S. government (http://www.treasurydirect.gov). To trade any other kind of bond, you \\nhave to go through a broker. The brokerage firm acts as a principal or dealer, buying \\nfrom or selling to investors, or as an agent for another buyer or seller. \\nStocks and Stock Markets \\nStocks or equity securities are shares of ownership. When you buy a share of stock, you \\nbuy a share of the corporation. The size of your share of the corporation is proportional \\nto the size of your stock holding. Since corporations exist to create profit for the owners, \\nwhen you buy a share of the corporation, you buy a share of its future profits. You are \\nliterally sharing in the fortunes of the company. \\nUnlike bonds, however, shares do not promise you any returns at all. If the company \\ndoes create a profit, some of that profit may be paid out to owners as a dividend, \\nusually in cash but sometimes in additional shares of stock. The company may pay no \\ndividend at all, however, in which case the value of your shares should rise as the \\ncompany’s profits rise. But even if the company is profitable, the value of its shares may \\nnot rise, for a variety of reasons having to do more with the markets or the larger \\neconomy than with the company itself. Likewise, when you invest in stocks, you share \\nthe company’s losses, which may decrease the value of your shares. \\nCorporations issue shares to raise capital. When shares are issued and traded in a public \\nmarket such as a stock exchange, the corporation is “publicly traded.” There are many \\nstock exchanges in the United States and around the world. The two best known in the \\nUnited States are the New York Stock Exchange (now NYSE Euronext), founded in 1792, \\nand the NASDAQ, a computerized trading system managed by the National Association \\nof Securities Dealers (the “AQ” stands for “Automated Quotations”). \\nOnly members of an exchange may trade on the exchange, so to buy or sell stocks you \\nmust go through a broker who is a member of the exchange. Brokers also manage your \\naccount and offer varying levels of advice and access to research. Most brokers have '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 287}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  288 \\nWeb-based trading systems. Some discount brokers offer minimal advice and research \\nalong with minimal trading commissions and fees. \\nCommodities and Derivatives \\nCommodities are resources or raw materials, including the following: \\n• Agricultural products (food and fibers), such as soybeans, pork bellies, and cotton \\n• Energy resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas \\n• Precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper \\n• Currencies, such as the dollar, yen, and euro \\nCommodity trading was formalized because of the risks inherent in producing \\ncommodities— raising and harvesting agricultural products or natural resources— and \\nthe resulting volatility of commodity prices. As farming and food production became \\nmechanized and required a larger investment of capital, commodity producers and users \\nwanted a way to reduce volatility by locking in prices over the longer term. \\nThe answer was futures and forward contracts. Futures and forward contracts or \\nforwards are a form of derivatives, the term for any financial instrument whose \\nvalue is derived from the value of another security. For example, suppose it is now July \\n2010. If you know that you will want to have wheat in May of 2011, you could wait until \\nMay 2011 and buy the wheat at the market price, which is unknown in July 2010. Or you \\ncould buy it now, paying today’s price, and store the wheat until May 2011. Doing so \\nwould remove your future price uncertainty, but you would incur the cost of storing the \\nwheat. \\nAlternatively, you could buy a futures contract for May 2011 wheat in July 2010. You \\nwould be buying May 2011 wheat at a price that is now known to you (as stated in the \\nfutures contract), but you will not take delivery of the wheat until May 2011. The value of \\nthe futures contract to you is that you are removing the future price uncertainty without \\nincurring any storage costs. In July 2010 the value of a contract to buy May 2011 wheat \\ndepends on what the price of wheat actually turns out to be in May 2011. \\nForward contracts are traded privately, as a direct deal made between the seller and the \\nbuyer, while futures contracts are traded publicly on an exchange such as the Chicago \\nMercantile Exchange (CME) or the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). \\nWhen you buy a forward contract for wheat, for example, you are literally buying future \\nwheat, wheat that doesn’t yet exist. Buying it now, you avoid any uncertainty about the \\nprice, which may change.

Options are the right but not the obligation to buy or sell at a specific price at a \\nspecific time in the future. Options are commonly written on shares of stock as well as \\non stock indices, interest rates, and commodities. \\nDerivatives such as forwards, futures, and options are used to hedge or protect against \\nan existing risk or to speculate on a future price. For a number of reasons, commodities \\nand derivatives are more risky than investing in stocks and bonds and are not the best \\nchoice for most individual investors. \\nMutual Funds, Index Funds, and Exchange-\\nTraded Funds \\nA mutual fund is an investment portfolio consisting of securities that an individual \\ninvestor can invest in all at once without having to buy each investment individually. \\nThe fund thus allows you to own the performance of many investments while actually \\nbuying— and paying the transaction cost for buying— only one investment. \\nMutual funds have become popular because they can provide diverse investments with a \\nminimum of transaction costs. In theory, they also provide good returns through the \\nperformance of professional portfolio managers. \\nAn index fund is a mutual fund designed to mimic the performance of an index, a \\nparticular collection of stocks or bonds whose performance is tracked as an indicator of \\nthe performance of an entire class or type of security. For example, the Standard & \\nPoor’s (S&P) 500 is an index of the five hundred largest publicly traded corporations, \\nand the famous Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index of thirty stocks of major \\nindustrial corporations. An index fund is a mutual fund invested in the same securities \\nas the index and so requires minimal management and should have minimal \\nmanagement fees or costs. \\nMutual funds are created and managed by mutual fund companies or by brokerages or \\neven banks. To trade shares of a mutual fund you must have an account with the \\ncompany, brokerage, or bank. Mutual funds are a large component of individual \\nretirement accounts and of defined contribution plans. \\nMutual fund shares are valued at the close of trading each day and orders placed the \\nnext day are executed at that price until it closes. An exchange-traded fund (ETF)A fund \\nthat tracks an index or a commodity or a basket of assets but is traded like stocks on a \\nstock exchange. is a mutual fund that trades like a share of stock in that it is valued \\ncontinuously throughout the day, and trades are executed at the market price. \\nThe ways that capital can be bought and sold is limited only by the imagination. When \\ncorporations or governments need financing, they invent ways to entice investors and \\npromise them a return. The last thirty years has seen an explosion in \\nfinancial engineering, the innovation of new financial instruments through \\nmathematical pricing models. This explosion has coincided with the ever-expanding '),\n",

The Internet also gives amateurs \\ninstantaneous access to information and accounts. \\nMuch of the modern portfolio theory that spawned these innovations (i.e., the idea of \\nusing the predictability of returns to manage portfolios of investments) is based on an \\ninfinite time horizon, looking at performance over very long periods of time. This has \\nbeen very valuable for institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, \\nendowments, foundations, and trusts) as it gives them the chance to magnify returns \\nover their infinite horizons. \\nFor most individual investors, however, most portfolio theory may present too much \\nrisk or just be impractical. Individual investors don’t have an infinite time horizon. You \\nhave only a comparatively small amount of time to create wealth and to enjoy it. For \\nindividual investors, investing is a process of balancing the demands and desires of \\nreturns with the costs of risk, before time runs out. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Bonds are \\no a way to raise capital through borrowing, used by corporations and governments; \\no an investment for the bondholder that creates return through regular, fixed or floating \\ninterest payments on the debt and the repayment of principal at maturity;  \\no traded on bond exchanges through brokers. \\n• Stocks are \\no a way to raise capital through selling ownership or equity; \\no an investment for shareholders that creates return through the distribution of corporate \\nprofits as dividends or through gains (losses) in corporate value; \\no traded on stock exchanges through member brokers. \\n• Commodities are \\no natural or cultivated resources; \\no traded to hedge revenue or production needs or to speculate on resources’ prices; \\no traded on commodities exchanges through brokers. \\n• Derivatives are instruments based on the future, and therefore uncertain, price of another \\nsecurity, such as a share of stock, a government bond, a currency, or a commodity.

She has been \\npaying her bills, paying back student loans and trying to save some money for a while. \\nHer uncle just died and left her a bequest of $50,000. She is thinking of investing it \\nsince she is getting by on her salary and has no immediate plans for this windfall. \\nAllison is wondering how to get into some serious investing. She is thinking that since so \\nmany people seem to be interested in “Wall Street,” there must be money in it. There is \\nno lack of information or advice about investing, but Allison isn’t sure how to get \\nstarted. \\nAllison may not realize that there are as many different investment strategies as there \\nare investors. The planning process is similar to planning a budget plan or savings plan. \\nYou figure out where you are, where you want to be, and how to get there. One way to \\nget started is to draw up an individual investment policy statement. \\nInvestment policy statements, outlines of the investor’s goals and constraints, are \\npopular with institutional investors such as pension plans, insurance companies, or \\nnonprofit endowments. Institutional investment decisions typically are made by \\nprofessional managers operating on instructions from a higher authority, usually a \\nboard of directors or trustees. The directors or trustees may approve the investment \\npolicy statement and then leave the specific investment decisions up to the professional \\ninvestment managers. The managers use the policy statement as their guide to the \\ndirectors’ wishes and concerns. \\nThis idea of a policy statement has been adapted for individual use, providing a helpful, \\nstructured framework for investment planning— and thinking. The advantages of \\ndrawing up an investment policy to use as a planning framework include the following: \\n• The process of creating the policy requires thinking through your goals and \\nexpectations and adjusting those to what is possible. \\n• The policy statement gives you an active role in your investment planning, even if \\nthe more specific details and implementation are left to a professional investment \\nadvisor. \\n• Your policy statement is portable, so even if you change advisors, your plan can \\ngo with you. \\n• Your policy statement is flexible; it can and should be updated at least once a \\nyear. \\nA policy statement is written in two parts. The first part lists your return objectives and \\nrisk preferences as an investor. The second part lists your constraints on investment. It \\nsometimes is difficult to reconcile the two parts. That is, you may need to adjust your \\nstatement to improve your chances of achieving your return objectives within your risk \\npreferences without violating your constraints. \\nDefining Return Objective and Risk '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 293}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  294 \\nDefining return objectives is the process of quantifying the required annual return (e.g., \\n5 percent, 10 percent) necessary to meet your investment goals. If your investment goals \\nare vague (e.g., to “increase wealth”), then any positive return will do. Usually, however, \\nyou have some specific goals— for example, to finance a child’s or grandchild’s \\neducation, to have a certain amount of wealth at retirement, to buy a sailboat on your \\nfiftieth birthday, and so on. \\nOnce you have defined goals, you must determine when they will happen and how much \\nthey will cost, or how much you will have to have invested to make your dreams come \\ntrue. As explained in Chapter 4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\", the rate of \\nreturn that your investments must achieve to reach your goals depends on how much \\nyou have to invest to start with, how long you have to invest it, and how much you need \\nto fulfill your goals. \\nAs in Allison’s case, your goals may not be so specific. Your thinking may be more along \\nthe lines of “I want my money to grow and not lose value” or “I want the investment to \\nprovide a little extra spending money until my salary rises as my career advances.” In \\nthat case, your return objective can be calculated based on the role that these funds play \\nin your life: safety net, emergency fund, extra spending money, or nest egg for the \\nfuture. \\nHowever specific (or not) your goals may be, the quantified return objective defines the \\nannual performance that you demand from your investments. Your portfolio can then be \\nstructured— you can choose your investments— such that it can be expected to provide \\nthat performance. \\nIf your return objective is more than can be achieved given your investment and \\nexpected market conditions, then you know to scale down your goals, or perhaps find a \\ndifferent way to fund them. For example, if Allison wanted to stop working in ten years \\nand start her own business, she probably would not be able to achieve this goal solely by \\ninvesting her $50,000 inheritance, even in a bull (up) market earning higher rates of \\nreturn. \\nAs you saw in Chapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: Insurance\" and Chapter 11 \\n\"Personal Risk Management: Retirement and Estate Planning\", in investing there is a \\ndirect relationship between risk and return, and risk is costly. The nature of these \\nrelationships has fascinated and frustrated investors since the origin of capital markets \\nand remains a subject of investigation, exploration, and debate. To invest is to take risk. \\nTo invest is to separate yourself from your money through actual distance— you literally \\ngive it to someone else— or through time. There is always some risk that what you get \\nback is worth less (or costs more) than what you invested (a loss) or less than what you \\nmight have had if you had done something else with your money (opportunity cost). The \\nmore risk you are willing to take, the more potential return you can make, but the higher \\nthe risk, the more potential losses and opportunity costs you may incur. \\nIndividuals have different risk tolerances. Your risk tolerance is your ability and \\nwillingness to assume risk. Your ability to assume risk is based on your asset base, your '),\n",

In other words, your ability to take investment \\nrisks is limited by how much you have to invest, how long you have to invest it, and your \\nneed for your portfolio to provide cash— for use rather than reinvestment— in the \\nmeantime. \\nYour willingness to take risk is shaped by your “personality,” your experiences, and your \\nknowledge and education. Attitudes are shaped by life experiences, and attitudes toward \\nrisk are no different. Figure 12.7 \"Risk Tolerance\" shows how your level of risk tolerance \\ndevelops. \\nFigure 12.7 Risk Tolerance \\n \\nInvestment advisors may try to gauge your attitude toward risk by having you answer a \\nseries of questions on a formal questionnaire or by just talking with you about your \\ninvestment approach. For example, an investor who says, “It’s more important to me to \\npreserve what I have than to make big gains in the markets,” is relatively risk averse. \\nThe investor who says, “I just want to make a quick profit,” is probably more of a risk \\nseeker. \\nOnce you have determined your return objective and risk tolerance (i.e., what it will take \\nto reach your goals and what you are willing and able to risk to get there) you may have \\nto reconcile the two. You may find that your goals are not realistic unless you are willing \\nto take on more risk. If you are unwilling or unable to take on more risk, you may have \\nto scale down your goals. \\nDefining Constraints \\n'),\n",

The more you can anticipate and include \\nconstraints in your planning, the less likely they will throw you off course. Constraints \\ninclude the following: \\n• Liquidity needs \\n• Time available \\n• Tax obligations \\n• Legal requirements \\n• Unique circumstances \\nLiquidity needs, or the need to use cash, can slow your progress from investing because \\nyou have to divert cash from your investment portfolio in order to spend it. In addition \\nyou will have ongoing expenses from investing. For example, you will have to use some \\nliquidity to cover your transaction costs such as brokerage fees and management fees. \\nYou may also wish to use your portfolio as a source of regular income or to finance asset \\npurchases, such as the down payment on a home or a new car or new appliances. \\nWhile these may be happy transactions for you, for your portfolio they are negative \\nevents, because they take away value from your investment portfolio. Since your \\nportfolio’s ability to earn return is based on its value, whenever you take away from that \\nvalue, you are reducing its ability to earn. \\nTime is another determinant of your portfolio’s earning power. The more time you have \\nto let your investments earn, the more earnings you can amass. Or, the more time you \\nhave to reach your goals, the more slowly you can afford to get there, earning less return \\neach year but taking less risk as you do. Your time horizon will depend on your age and \\nlife stage and on your goals and their specific liquidity needs. \\nTax obligations are another constraint, because paying taxes takes value away from your \\ninvestments. Investment value may be taxed in many ways (as income tax, capital gains \\ntax, property tax, estate tax, or gift tax) depending on how it is invested, how its returns \\nare earned, and how ownership is transferred if it is bought or sold. \\nInvestors typically want to avoid, defer, or minimize paying taxes, and some investment \\nstrategies will do that better than others. In any case, your individual tax liabilities may \\nbecome a constraint in determining how the portfolio earns to best avoid, defer, or \\nminimize taxes. \\nLegalities also can be a constraint if the portfolio is not owned by you as an individual \\ninvestor but by a personal trust or a family foundation. Trusts and foundations have \\nlegal constraints defined by their structure. \\n“Unique circumstances” refer to your individual preferences, beliefs, and values as an \\ninvestor. For example, some investors believe in socially responsible investing (SRI), so \\nthey want their funds to be invested in companies that practice good corporate \\ngovernance, responsible citizenship, fair trade practices, or environmental stewardship.

If an investment earns 5 percent, for \\nexample, that means that for every $100 invested, you would earn $5 per year (because \\n$5 = 5% of $100). \\nReturns are created in two ways: the investment creates income or the investment gains \\n(or loses) value. To calculate the annual rate of return for an investment, you need to \\nknow the income created, the gain (loss) in value, and the original value at the beginning \\nof the year. The percentage return can be calculated as in Figure 12.8 \"Calculating \\nPercentage Return\". \\nFigure 12.8 Calculating Percentage Return \\n \\nNote that if the ending value is greater than the original value, then Ending value − \\nOriginal value > 0 (is greater than zero), and you have a gain that adds to your return. If \\nthe ending value is less, then Ending value − Original value < 0 (is less than zero), and \\nyou have a loss that detracts from your return. If there is no gain or loss, if Ending value \\n− Original value = 0 (is the same), then your return is simply the income that the \\ninvestment created. \\nFor example, if you buy a share of stock for $100, and it pays no dividend, and a year \\nlater the market price is $105, then your return = [0 + (105 − 100)] ÷ 100 = 5 ÷ 100 = \\n5%. If the same stock paid a dividend of $2, then your return = [2 + (105 − 100)] ÷ 100 \\n= 7 ÷ 100 = 7%. \\nIf the information you have shows more than one year’s results, you can calculate the \\nannual return using what you learned in Chapter 4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and \\nValue\" about the relationships of time and value. For example, if an investment was \\nworth $10,000 five years ago and is worth $14,026 today, then $10,000 × (1+ r)5 = \\n$14,026. Solving for r— the annual rate of return, assuming you have not taken the \\nreturns out in the meantime— and using a calculator, a computer application, or doing \\nthe math, you get 7 percent. So the $10,000 investment must have earned at a rate of 7 \\npercent per year to be worth $14,026 five years later, other factors being equal. \\nWhile information about current and past returns is useful, investment professionals are \\nmore concerned with the expected return for the investment, that is, how much it \\nmay be expected to earn in the future. Estimating the expected return is complicated \\nbecause many factors (i.e., current economic conditions, industry conditions, and \\nmarket conditions) may affect that estimate. \\n'),\n",

Economic cycles fluctuate, and industry and firm conditions vary, but \\nover the long run, an investment that has survived has weathered all those storms. So \\nyou could look at the average of the returns for each year. There are several ways to do \\nthe math, but if you look at the average return for different investments of the same \\nasset class or type (e.g., stocks of large companies) you could compare what they have \\nreturned, on average, over time. Figure 12.9 \"S&P 500 Average Annual Return\" shows \\naverage returns on investments in the S&P 500, an index of large U.S. companies since \\n1990. \\nFigure 12.9 S&P 500 Average Annual Return[1]  \\n \\nIf the time period you are looking at is long enough, you can reasonably assume that an \\ninvestment’s average return over time is the return you can expect in the next year. For \\nexample, if a company’s stock has returned, on average, 9 percent per year over the last \\ntwenty years, then if next year is an average year, that investment should return 9 \\npercent again. Over the eighteen-year span from 1990 to 2008, for example, the average \\nreturn for the S&P 500 was 9.16 percent. Unless you have some reason to believe that \\nnext year will not be an average year, the average return can be your expected return. \\nThe longer the time period you consider, the less volatility there will be in the returns, \\nand the more accurate your prediction of expected returns will be. \\nReturns are the value created by an investment, through either income or gains. Returns \\nare also your compensation for investing, for taking on some or all of the risk of the \\ninvestment, whether it is a corporation, government, parcel of real estate, or work of art. \\nEven if there is no risk, you must be paid for the use of liquidity that you give up to the \\ninvestment (by investing). \\nReturns are the benefits from investing, but they must be larger than its costs. There are \\nat least two costs to investing: the opportunity cost of giving up cash and giving up all \\nyour other uses of that cash until you get it back in the future and the cost of the risk you \\ntake— the risk that you won’t get it all back. \\n'),\n",

Risk is measured by the amount of \\nvolatility, that is, the difference between actual returns and average (expected) returns. \\nThis difference is referred to as the standard deviation. Returns with a large standard \\ndeviation (showing the greatest variance from the average) have higher volatility and are \\nthe riskier investments. \\nAs Figure 12.9 \"S&P 500 Average Annual Return\" shows, an investment may do better \\nor worse than its average. Thus, standard deviation can be used to define the expected \\nrange of investment returns. For the S&P 500, for example, the standard deviation from \\n1990 to 2008 was 19.54 percent. So, in any given year, the S&P 500 is expected to return \\n9.16 percent but its return could be as high as 67.78 percent or as low as −49.46 percent, \\nbased on its performance during that specific period. \\nWhat risks are there? What would cause an investment to unexpectedly over- or \\nunderperform? Starting from the top (the big picture) and working down, there are \\n• economic risks, \\n• industry risks, \\n• company risks, \\n• asset class risks, \\n• market risks. \\nEconomic risks are risks that something will upset the economy as a whole. The \\neconomic cycle may swing from expansion to recession, for example; inflation or \\ndeflation may increase, unemployment may increase, or interest rates may fluctuate. \\nThese macroeconomic factors affect everyone doing business in the economy. Most \\nbusinesses are cyclical, growing when the economy grows and contracting when the \\neconomy contracts. \\nConsumers tend to spend more disposable income when they are more confident about \\neconomic growth and the stability of their jobs and incomes. They tend to be more \\nwilling and able to finance purchases with debt or with credit, expanding their ability to \\npurchase durable goods. So, demand for most goods and services increases as an \\neconomy expands, and businesses expand too. An exception is businesses that are \\ncountercyclical. Their growth accelerates when the economy is in a downturn and slows \\nwhen the economy expands. For example, low-priced fast food chains typically have \\nincreased sales in an economic downturn because people substitute fast food for more \\nexpensive restaurant meals as they worry more about losing their jobs and incomes. \\nIndustry risks usually involve economic factors that affect an entire industry or \\ndevelopments in technology that affect an industry’s markets. An example is the effect of \\na sudden increase in the price of oil (a macroeconomic event) on the airline industry. \\nEvery airline is affected by such an event, as an increase in the price of airplane fuel '),\n",

An industry such as real estate is vulnerable \\nto changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates, for example, makes it harder for \\npeople to borrow money to finance purchases, which depresses the value of real estate. \\nCompany risk refers to the characteristics of specific businesses or firms that affect their \\nperformance, making them more or less vulnerable to economic and industry risks. \\nThese characteristics include how much debt financing the company uses, how well it \\ncreates economies of scale, how efficient its inventory management is, how flexible its \\nlabor relationships are, and so on. \\nThe asset class that an investment belongs to can also bear on its performance and \\nrisk. Investments (assets) are categorized in terms of the markets they trade in. Broadly \\ndefined, asset classes include \\n• corporate stock or equities (shares in public corporations, domestic, or foreign); \\n• bonds or the public debts of corporation or governments; \\n• commodities or resources (e.g., oil, coffee, or gold); \\n• derivatives or contracts based on the performance of other underlying assets; \\n• real estate (both residential and commercial); \\n• fine art and collectibles (e.g., stamps, coins, baseball cards, or vintage cars). \\nWithin those broad categories, there are finer distinctions. For example, corporate stock \\nis classified as large cap, mid cap, or small cap, depending on the size of the corporation \\nas measured by its market capitalization (the aggregate value of its stock). Bonds are \\ndistinguished as corporate or government and as short-term, intermediate-term, or \\nlong-term, depending on the maturity date. \\nRisks can affect entire asset classes. Changes in the inflation rate can make corporate \\nbonds more or less valuable, for example, or more or less able to create valuable returns. \\nIn addition, changes in a market can affect an investment’s value. When the stock \\nmarket fell unexpectedly and significantly, as it did in October of 1929, 1987, and 2008, \\nall stocks were affected, regardless of relative exposure to other kinds of risk. After such \\nan event, the market is usually less efficient or less liquid; that is, there is less trading \\nand less efficient pricing of assets (stocks) because there is less information flowing \\nbetween buyers and sellers. The loss in market efficiency further affects the value of \\nassets traded. \\nAs you can see, the link between risk and return is reciprocal. The question for investors \\nand their advisors is: How can you get higher returns with less risk? \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• There is a direct relationship between risk and return because investors will demand more \\ncompensation for sharing more investment risk.

Explain the use of diversification in portfolio strategy. \\n2. List the steps in creating a portfolio strategy, explaining the importance of each step.  \\n3. Compare and contrast active and passive portfolio strategies. \\nEvery investor wants to maximize return, the earnings or gains from giving up surplus \\ncash. And every investor wants to minimize risk, because it is costly. To invest is to \\nassume risk, and you assume risk expecting to be compensated through return. The \\nmore risk assumed, the more the promised return. So, to increase return you must \\nincrease risk. To lessen risk, you must expect less return, but another way to lessen risk \\nis to diversify— to spread out your investments among a number of different asset \\nclasses. Investing in different asset classes reduces your exposure to economic, asset \\nclass, and market risks. \\nConcentrating investment concentrates risk. Diversifying investments spreads risk by \\nhaving more than one kind of investment and thus more than one kind of risk. To truly \\ndiversify, you need to invest in assets that are not vulnerable to one or more kinds of \\nrisk. For example, you may want to diversify '),\n",

If you choose the \\ninvestments well, if they are truly different from each other, the whole can actually be \\nmore valuable than the sum of its parts. \\nSteps to Diversification \\nIn traditional portfolio theory, there are three levels or steps to diversifying: capital \\nallocation, asset allocation, and security selection. \\nCapital allocation is diversifying your capital between risky and riskless investments. \\nA “riskless” asset is the short-term (less than ninety-day) U.S. Treasury bill. Because it \\nhas such a short time to maturity, it won’t be much affected by interest rate changes, \\nand it is probably impossible for the U.S. government to become insolvent— go \\nbankrupt— and have to default on its debt within such a short time. \\nThe capital allocation decision is the first diversification decision. It determines the \\nportfolio’s overall exposure to risk, or the proportion of the portfolio that is invested in \\nrisky assets. That, in turn, will determine the portfolio’s level of return. \\nThe second diversification decision is asset allocation, deciding which asset classes, \\nand therefore which risks and which markets, to invest in. Asset allocations are specified \\nin terms of the percentage of the portfolio’s total value that will be invested in each asset \\nclass. To maintain the desired allocation, the percentages are adjusted periodically as \\nasset values change. Figure 12.11 \"Proposed Asset Allocation\" shows an asset allocation \\nfor an investor’s portfolio. \\nFigure 12.11 Proposed Asset Allocation '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 306}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  307 \\n \\nAsset allocation is based on the expected returns and relative risk of each asset class and \\nhow it will contribute to the return and risk of the portfolio as a whole. If the asset \\nclasses you choose are truly diverse, then the portfolio’s risk can be lower than the sum \\nof the assets’ risks. \\nOne example of an asset allocation strategy is life cycle investing— changing your \\nasset allocation as you age. When you retire, for example, and forgo income from \\nworking, you become dependent on income from your investments. As you approach \\nretirement age, therefore, you typically shift your asset allocation to less risky asset \\nclasses to protect the value of your investments. \\nSecurity selection is the third step in diversification, choosing individual investments \\nwithin each asset class. Here is the chance to achieve industry or sector and company \\ndiversification. For example, if you decided to include corporate stock in your portfolio \\n(asset allocation), you decide which corporation’s stock to invest in. Choosing \\ncorporations in different industries, or companies of different sizes or ages, will diversify \\nyour stock holdings. You will have less risk than if you invested in just one corporation’s \\nstock. Diversification is not defined by the number of investments but by their different \\ncharacteristics and performance. \\nInvestment Strategies \\nCapital allocation decides the amount of overall risk in the portfolio; asset allocation \\ntries to maximize the return you can get for that amount of risk. Security selection \\nfurther diversifies within each asset class. Figure 12.12 \"Levels of Diversification\" \\ndemonstrates the three levels of diversification. \\nFigure 12.12 Levels of Diversification \\n'),\n",

Indexes are a way of measuring the performance of an \\nentire asset class by measuring returns for a portfolio containing all the investments in \\nthat asset class. Essentially, the index becomes a benchmark for the asset class, a \\nstandard against which any specific investment in that asset class can be measured. An \\nindex fund is an investment that holds the same securities as the index, so it provides a \\nway for you to invest in an entire asset class without having to select particular \\nsecurities. For example, if you invest in the S&P 500 Index fund, you are investing in the \\nfive hundred largest corporations in the United States— the asset class of large \\ncorporations. \\nThere are indexes and index funds for most asset classes. By investing in an index, you \\nare achieving the most diversification possible for that asset class without having to \\nmake individual investments, that is, without having to make any security selection \\ndecisions. This strategy of bypassing the security selection decision is called \\npassive management. It also has the advantage of saving transaction costs (broker’s \\nfees) because you can invest in the entire index through only one transaction rather than \\nthe many transactions that picking investments would require. \\nIn contrast, making security selection decisions to maximize returns and minimize risks \\nis called active management. Investors who favor active management feel that the \\nadvantages of picking specific investments, after careful research and analysis, are \\nworth the added transaction costs. Actively managed portfolios may achieve \\ndiversification based on the quality, rather than the quantity, of securities selected. \\nAlso, asset allocation can be actively managed through the strategy of market timing—\\nshifting the asset allocation in anticipation of economic shifts or market volatility. For \\nexample, if you forecast a period of higher inflation, you would reduce allocation in \\nfixed-rate bonds or debt instruments, because inflation erodes the value of the fixed \\nrepayments. Until the inflation passes, you would shift your allocation so that more of \\nyour portfolio is in stocks, say, and less in bonds. \\nIt is rare, however, for active investors or investment managers to achieve superior \\nresults over time. More commonly, an investment manager is unable to achieve \\n'),\n",

Classic economics assumes that people are rational when they make \\neconomic or financial decisions. “Rational” means that people respond to incentives \\nbecause their goal is always to maximize benefit and minimize costs. Not everyone \\nshares the same idea of benefit and cost, but in a market with millions of participants, \\nthere tends to be some general consensus. \\nThis belief in rationality leads to the idea of market efficiency. In an efficient market, \\nprices reflect “fundamental value” as appraised by rational decision makers who have \\naccess to information and are free to choose to buy or sell as their rational decisions \\ndictate. The belief in efficiency assumes that when prices do not reflect real value, people \\nwill notice and will act on the anomaly with the result that the market “corrects” that \\nprice. \\nPeople are not always rational, however, and markets are not always efficient. \\nBehavioral finance is the study of why individuals do not always make the decisions \\nthey are expected to make and why markets do not reliably behave as they are expected \\nto behave. As market participants, individuals are affected by others’ behavior, which \\ncollectively affects market behavior, which in turn affects all the participants in the \\nmarket. \\nAs an individual, you participate in the capital markets and are vulnerable to the \\nindividual and market behaviors that influence the outcomes of your decisions. The \\nmore you understand and anticipate those behaviors, the better your financial decision \\nmaking may be. \\n13.1 Investor Behavior \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify and describe the biases that can affect investor decision making.  \\n2. Explain how framing errors can influence investor decision making. \\n3.

In addition, biases can cause people to emphasize or discount information or \\ncan lead to too strong an attachment to an idea or an inability to recognize an \\nopportunity. The context in which you see a decision, the mental frame you give it (i.e., \\nthe kind of decision you determine it to be) can also inhibit your otherwise objective \\nview.[1]  \\nLearning to recognize your behaviors and habits of mind that act as impediments to \\nobjective decision making may help you to overcome them. \\nBiases \\nOne kind of investor behavior that leads to unexpected decisions is biasA tendency or \\npreference or belief that interferes with objectivity., a predisposition to a view that \\ninhibits objective thinking. Biases that can affect investment decisions are the following: \\n• Availability \\n• Representativeness \\n• Overconfidence \\n• Anchoring \\n• Ambiguity aversion[2]  \\nAvailability bias occurs because investors rely on information to make informed \\ndecisions, but not all information is readily available. Investors tend to give more weight \\nto more available information and to discount information that is brought to their \\nattention less often. The stocks of corporations that get good press, for example, claim to \\ndo better than those of less publicized companies when in reality these “high-profile” \\ncompanies may actually have worse earnings and return potential. \\nRepresentativeness is decision making based on stereotypes, characterizations that \\nare treated as “representative” of all members of a group. In investing, \\nrepresentativeness is a tendency to be more optimistic about investments that have \\nperformed well lately and more pessimistic about investments that have performed \\npoorly. In your mind you stereotype the immediate past performance of investments as \\n“strong” or “weak.” This representation then makes it hard to think of them in any other \\nway or to analyze their potential. As a result, you may put too much emphasis on past \\nperformance and not enough on future prospects. \\nObjective investment decisions involve forming expectations about what will happen, \\nmaking educated guesses by gathering as much information as possible and making as \\ngood use of it as possible. Overconfidence is a bias in which you have too much faith \\nin the precision of your estimates, causing you to underestimate the range of \\npossibilities that actually exist. You may underestimate the extent of possible losses, for \\nexample, and therefore underestimate investment risks. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 312}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  313 \\nOverconfidence also comes from the tendency to attribute good results to good investor \\ndecisions and bad results to bad luck or bad markets. \\nAnchoring happens when you cannot integrate new information into your thinking \\nbecause you are too “anchored” to your existing views. You do not give new information \\nits due, especially if it contradicts your previous views. By devaluing new information, \\nyou tend to underreact to changes or news and become less likely to act, even when it is \\nin your interest. \\nAmbiguity aversion is the tendency to prefer the familiar to the unfamiliar or the \\nknown to the unknown. Avoiding ambiguity can lead to discounting opportunities with \\ngreater uncertainty in favor of “sure things.” In that case, your bias against uncertainty \\nmay create an opportunity cost for your portfolio. Availability bias and ambiguity \\naversion can also result in a failure to diversify, as investors tend to “stick with what \\nthey know.” For example, in a study of defined contribution retirement accounts or \\n401(k)s, more than 35 percent of employees had more than 30 percent of their account \\ninvested in the employing company’s stock, and 23 percent had more than 50 percent of \\ntheir retirement account invested in their employer’s stock[3]  \\n— hardly a well-diversified asset allocation. \\nFraming \\nFraming refers to the way you see alternatives and define the context in which you are \\nmaking a decision.[4]  \\nYour framing determines how you imagine the problem, its possible solutions, and its \\nconnection with other situations. A concept related to framing is mental accounting: \\nthe way individuals encode, describe, and assess economic outcomes when they make \\nfinancial decisions.[5]  \\nIn financial behavior, framing can lead to shortsighted views, narrow-minded \\nassumptions, and restricted choices. \\nEvery rational economic decision maker would prefer to avoid a loss, to have benefits be \\ngreater than costs, to reduce risk, and to have investments gain value. Loss aversion \\nrefers to the tendency to loathe realizing a loss to the extent that you avoid it even when \\nit is the better choice. \\nHow can it be rational for a loss to be the better choice? Say you buy stock for $100 per \\nshare. Six months later, the stock price has fallen to $63 per share. You decide not to sell \\nthe stock to avoid realizing the loss. If there is another stock with better earnings \\npotential, however, your decision creates an opportunity cost. You pass up the better \\nchance to increase value in the hopes that your original value will be regained. Your \\nopportunity cost likely will be greater than the benefit of holding your stock, but you will \\ndo anything to avoid that loss. Loss aversion is an instance where a rational aversion \\nleads you to underestimate a real cost, leading you to choose the lesser alternative. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 313}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  314 \\nLoss aversion is also a form of regret aversion. Regret is a feeling of responsibility for \\nloss or disappointment. Past decisions and their outcomes inform your current \\ndecisions, but regret can bias your decision making. Regret can anchor you too firmly in \\npast experience and hinder you from seeing new circumstances. Framing can affect your \\nrisk tolerance. You may be more willing to take risk to avoid a loss if you are loss averse, \\nfor example, or you may simply become unwilling to assume risk, depending on how you \\ndefine the context. \\nFraming also influences how you manage making more than one decision \\nsimultaneously. If presented with multiple but separate choices, most people tend to \\ndecide on each separately, mentally segregating each decision.[6]  \\nBy framing choices as separate and unrelated, however, you may miss making the best \\ndecisions, which may involve comparing or combining choices. Lack of diversification or \\noverdiversification in a portfolio may also result. \\nInvestor Profiles \\nAn investor profile expresses a combination of characteristics based on personality \\ntraits, life stage, sources of wealth, and other factors. What is your investor profile? The \\nbetter you can know yourself as an investor, the better investment decisions you can \\nmake. \\nResearchers have identified some features or characteristics of investors that seem to \\nlead to recognizable tendencies.[7]  \\nFor example, stages of life have an effect on goals, views, and decisions, as shown in the \\nexamples in Figure 13.2 \"Life Stage Profiles\". \\nFigure 13.2 Life Stage Profiles \\n \\n'),\n",

In each of these \\nstages, your goals and your risk tolerance— both your ability and willingness to assume \\nrisk— change. Generally, the further you are from retirement and the loss of your wage \\nincome, the more risk you will take with your investments, having another source of \\nincome (your paycheck). As you get closer to retirement, you become more concerned \\nwith preserving your investment’s value so that it can generate income when it becomes \\nyour sole source of income in retirement, thus causing you to become less risk tolerant. \\nAfter retirement, your risk tolerance decreases even more, until the very end of your life \\nwhen you are concerned with dispersing rather than preserving your wealth. \\nRisk tolerance and investment approaches are affected by more than age and investment \\nstage, however. Studies have shown that the source and amount of wealth can be a \\nfactor in attitudes toward investment.[8]  \\nThose who have inherited wealth or come to it “passively,” tend to be much more risk \\naverse than those who have “actively” created their own wealth. Entrepreneurs, for \\nexample, who have created wealth, tend to be much more willing to assume investment \\nrisk, perhaps because they have more confidence in their ability to create more wealth \\nshould their investments lose value. Those who have inherited wealth tend to be much \\nmore risk averse, as they see their wealth as a windfall that, once lost, they cannot \\nreplace. \\nActive wealth owners also tend to be more active investors, more involved in investment \\ndecisions and more knowledgeable about their investment portfolios. They have more \\nconfidence in their ability to manage and to make good decisions than do passive wealth \\nowners, who haven’t had the experience to build confidence. \\nNot surprisingly, those with more wealth to invest tend to be more willing to assume \\nrisk.

Describe the limits of arbitrage that may perpetuate market inefficiency.  \\n3. Identify the economic and cultural factors that can allow market inefficiencies to persist.  \\n4. Explain the role of feedback as reinforcement of market inefficiencies.  \\nYour economic behaviors affect economic markets. Market results reflect the collective \\nyet independent decisions of millions of individuals. There have been years, even \\ndecades, when some markets have not produced expected or “rational” prices because of \\nthe collective behavior of their participants. In inefficient markets, prices may go way \\nabove or below actual value. \\nThe efficient market theory relies on the idea that investors behave rationally and \\nthat even when they don’t, their numbers are so great and their behavioral biases are so \\ndiverse that their irrational behaviors will have little overall effect on the market. In \\neffect, investors’ anomalous behaviors will cancel each other out. Thus, diversification \\n(of participants) lowers risk (to the market). \\nAnother protection of market efficiency is the tendency for most participants to behave \\nrationally. If an asset is mispriced so that its market price deviates from its intrinsic \\nvalue, knowledgeable investors will see that and take advantage of the opportunity. If a \\nstock seems underpriced they will buy, driving prices back up. If a stock seems '),\n",

These strategies are called \\narbitrage, or the process of creating investment gains from market mispricings \\n(arbitrage opportunities). The knowledgeable investors who carry out market \\ncorrections through their investment decisions are called arbitrageurs. \\nThere are limits to arbitrage, however. There are times when the stock markets seem to \\nrise or fall much more or for much longer than the dynamics of market correction would \\npredict. \\nLimits of Arbitrage \\nArbitrage may not work when the costs outweigh the benefits. Investment costs include \\ntransaction costs, such as brokers’ fees, and risk, especially market risk. \\nAn investor who sees an arbitrage opportunity would have to act quickly to take \\nadvantage of it, because chances are good that someone else will and the advantage will \\ndisappear along with the arbitrage opportunity. Acting quickly may involve borrowing if \\nliquid funds are not available to invest. For this reason, transaction costs for arbitrage \\ntrades are likely to be higher (because they are likely to include interest), and if the costs \\nare higher than the benefits, the market will not be corrected. \\nThe risk of arbitrage is that the investor rather than the market is mispricing stocks. In \\nother words, arbitrageurs assume that the current valuation for an asset will reverse—\\nwill go down if the valuation has gone too high, or will go up if the valuation has gone \\ntoo low. If their analysis of fundamental value is incorrect, the market correction may \\nnot occur as predicted, and neither will their gains. \\nMost arbitrageurs are professional wealth managers. They invest for very wealthy clients \\nwith a large asset base and very high tolerance for risk. Arbitrage is usually not a sound \\npractice for individual investors. \\nCauses of Market Inefficiency \\nMarket inefficiencies can persist when they go undiscovered or when they seem rational. \\nEconomic historians point out that while every asset “bubble” is in some ways unique, \\nthere are common economic factors at work.[2]  \\nBubbles are accompanied by lower interest rates, increased use of debt financing, new \\ntechnology, and a decrease in government regulation or oversight. Those factors \\nencourage economic expansion, leading to growth of earnings potential and thus of \\ninvestment return, which would make assets genuinely more valuable. \\nA key study of the U.S. stock market points out that there are cultural as well as \\neconomic factors that can encourage or validate market inefficiency.[3]  \\nExamples include '),\n",

An example is the \\ndotcom bubble of 1990–2000, when stock prices of Internet start-up companies rose far \\nhigher than their value or earning capacity. Yet investors irrationally kept investing until \\nthe first wave of start-ups failed, bursting the market bubble. \\nEconomic and cultural factors can prolong market inefficiency by reinforcing the \\nbehaviors that created it, in a kind of feedback loop. For example, financial news \\ncoverage in the media increased during the 1990s with the global saturation of cable and \\nsatellite television and radio, as well as the growth of the Internet.[4]  \\nMore information availability can lead to more availability bias. Stereotyping can \\ndevelop as a result of repeated “news,” resulting in representation bias, which \\nencourages overconfidence or too little questioning or analysis of the situation. \\nMisinterpreting market inefficiency as real changes can cause framing problems and \\nother biases as well. \\nIn this way, market inefficiencies can become self-fulfilling prophecies. Investing in an \\ninefficient market causes asset values to rise, leading to gains and to more investments. \\nThe rise in asset values becomes self-reinforcing as it encourages anchoring, the \\nexpectation that asset values will continue to rise. Inefficiency becomes the norm. Those \\nwho do not invest in this market thus incur an opportunity cost. Participating in \\nperpetuating market inefficiency, rather than correcting it, becomes the rational choice. \\nReliance on media experts and informal communication or “word of mouth” reinforces \\nthis behavior to the point where it can become epidemic. It may not be mere \\ncoincidence, for example, that the stock market bubble of the 1920s happened as radio \\nand telephone access became universal in the United States,[5]  \\nor that the stock boom of the 1990s coincided with the proliferation of mobile phones \\nand e-mail, or that the real estate bubble of the 2000s coincided with our creation of the \\nblogosphere. \\nMarket efficiency requires that investors act independently so that the market reflects \\nthe consensus opinion of their independent judgments. Instead, the market may be \\nreflecting the opinions of a few to whom others defer. Although the volume of market \\nparticipation would seem to show lots of participation, few are actually participating. '),\n",

The market then reflects the consensus of the few rather than \\nthe many; hence, the probability of mispricing rises. \\nIt is difficult to know what is happening while you are in the middle of an inefficient \\nmarket situation. It is easier to look back through market history and point out obvious \\npanics or bubbles, but they were not so obvious to participants while they were \\nhappening.

People are looking for ways to invest their \\nnewfound wealth. This leads to an asset bubble, a rapid increase in the price of some \\nasset: bonds, stocks, real estate, or commodities such as cotton, gold, oil, or tulip bulbs \\nthat seems to be positioned to prosper from this particular expansion. \\nFigure 13.7 Pattern of a Financial Crisis \\n \\nThe bubble continues, reinforced by the behavioral and market consequences that it \\nsparks until some event pricks the bubble. Then asset values quickly deflate, and credit \\ndefaults rise, damaging the banking system. Having lost wealth and access to credit, \\npeople rein in their demand for consumption and investment, further slowing the \\neconomy. \\nFigure 13.8 \"Major Asset Bubbles Since 1636\" shows some of the major asset bubbles \\nsince 1636 and the events that preceded them.[2]  \\nFigure 13.8 Major Asset Bubbles Since 1636 \\n'),\n",

Often the asset that was the object \\nof speculation was a resource for or an application of a new technology or an expansion \\ninto new territory that may have been critical to a new emphasis in the economy. In \\nother words, the assets that became the objects of bubbles tended to be the drivers of a \\n“new economy” at the time and thus were rationalized as investments rather than as \\nspeculation. \\nIn all the examples listed in Figure 13.8 \"Major Asset Bubbles Since 1636\", as asset \\nvalues rose— even if only on the strength of investor beliefs— speculators, financed by an \\nexpansion of credit, augmented the market and drove up asset prices even further. Many \\nirrational financial behaviors— overconfidence, anchoring, availability bias, \\nrepresentativeness— were in play, until finally the market was shocked into reversal by a \\nspecific event or simply sank under its own weight. \\nEconomists may argue that this is what you should expect, that markets expand and \\ncontract cyclically as a matter of course. In this view, a crash is nothing more than the \\ncorrection for a bubble— market efficiency at work. \\nExamples: The Internet Stock Boom and the Crash of 1929 \\nMuch has been and will be written about a classic financial crisis, the Internet stock \\nboom of the 1990s.[3]  \\n'),\n",

The previous decade had seen a \\nrecovery from a major inflation and a recession in the United States followed by an \\neconomic expansion. Deregulation and new technologies had opened up the \\ntelecommunications industry. In 1989 the Soviet Union dissolved, opening markets and \\nmarket economies in Eastern Europe as well as the former Soviet Union (FSU). The \\npersonal computer had taken hold and was gaining in household saturation. \\nThis mix of relative prosperity, low inflation, new global markets, and new technology \\nlooked very promising. Classically, the economy expanded, and a new asset bubble was \\nborn. \\nMost Internet companies that were publicly traded were listed on the NASDAQ \\nexchange. Figure 13.9 \"NASDAQ Composite Index, 1989–2008\" shows the NASDAQ \\ncomposite index from 1991 to 2002. \\nFigure 13.9 NASDAQ Composite Index, 1989–2008[4]  \\n \\nBetween 1990 and 2000 the NASDAQ Composite Index increased ten-fold. At the height \\nof the bubble, between 1998 and 2000, the value of the index increased 2.5 times, \\nresulting in an average annualized return of over 58 percent. \\nAlan Greenspan, then Chair of the Federal Reserve Bank, spoke on Capital Hill at the \\nend of January 1999. In response to the question about how much of the stock boom \\nwas “based on sound fundamentals and how much is based on hype.” Greenspan \\nreplied, \\n“First of all, you wouldn’t get ‘hype’ working if there weren’t something fundamentally, \\npotentially sound under it. \\n“The size of the potential market is so huge that you have these pie-in-the-sky type of \\npotentials for a lot of different [firms].

The vast majority are almost sure to fail. That’s the way \\nmarkets tend to work in this regard.…  \\n“But there is at root here something far more fundamental— the stock market seeking \\nout profitable ventures and directing capital to hopeful projects before profits \\nmaterialize. That’s good for our system. And, in fact, with all its hype and craziness, is \\nsomething that, at the end of the day, is probably more plus than minus.”[5]  \\nGreenspan implies that the bubble “with all its hype and craziness” is nothing more than \\nbusiness as usual in the capital markets. He sees the irrational as somewhat rational and \\nnot merely the “irrational exuberance” that he saw little more than two years earlier.[6]  \\nGoing back a bit further, the Crash of 1929 was perhaps the most profound end to an \\nasset bubble, at least in the American psyche, as it seemed to precipitate a lengthy \\ndepression, the Great Depression. The reasons for the prolonged recession that followed \\nthe crash are complex, but the factors leading up to it illustrate a classic asset bubble. \\nIn the decade after World War I, the U.S. economy boomed. With the war over, inflation \\neased and markets opened. Our manufacturing competitors in Europe had suffered \\nlosses of labor, capital, and infrastructure that allowed the United States to establish a \\nglobal dominance. Technologies such as radio were changing the speed of life, while the \\nmass production of everything from cars to appliances was changing the quality of life. \\nElectrification and roads developed a national infrastructure. To finance the \\nconsumption of all this mass production, the idea of “store credit” was beginning to \\nexpand into the system of consumer credit that we use today. As interest rates stayed \\nlow, levels of household and corporate debt rose. \\nNew technologies were developed by new corporations that needed mass, public \\nfinancing. As more and more shares were issued, they were pitched more fervently to \\nencourage more investment by more investors. Investing became the national pastime, \\nshare prices rose, and investors were reassured that technology had spawned a new \\neconomy to create new wealth. As in the 1990s, the mix of relative prosperity, low \\ninflation, new global markets, and new technology looked very promising. The positive \\nfeedback loop of a classic asset bubble had been created. \\nAfter it was all over, Groucho, one of the famous Marx Brothers comedians, reflected on \\nthe rationalized irrationality of the bubble: “I would have lost more, but that was all the \\nmoney I had.”[7]  \\nGiven that you can expect to encounter at least a few crises during your investing \\nlifetime, as you think about investing— creating and managing wealth— how can you \\nprotect yourself? How can you “keep your head when all about you / Are losing \\ntheirs,”[8] and is that really the right thing to do? \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Prolonged market inefficiencies can result in asset bubbles.

Identify the factors that make successful market timing difficult. \\n2. Explain how technical analysis is used as an investment strategy.  \\n3. Identify the factors that encourage investor fraud in an asset bubble.  \\nYou can apply your knowledge of findings from the field of behavioral finance in a \\nnumber of ways. First, you can be alert to and counteract your natural tendencies \\ntoward investor bias and framing. For example, you can avoid availability bias by \\ngathering news from different sources and by keeping the news in historical perspective. \\nA long-term viewpoint can also help you avoid anchoring or assuming that current \\nperformance indicates future performance. At the same time, keep in mind that current \\nmarket trends are not the same as the past trends they may resemble. For example, \\nfactors leading to stock market crashes include elements unique to each. \\nAmbiguity aversion can be useful if your uncertainty is caused by a lack of information, \\nas it can let you know when you need to do more homework. On the other hand, \\naversion to ambiguity can blind you to promising opportunities. \\nLoss aversion, like any fear, is useful when it keeps you from taking too much risk, but \\nnot when it keeps you from profitable opportunities. Using knowledge to best assess the \\nscope and probability of loss is a way to see the loss in context. Likewise, segregating \\ninvestments by their goals, risks, liquidity, and time horizons may be useful for, say, \\nencouraging you to save for retirement or some other goal. \\nYour best protection against your own behavioral impulses, however, is to have a plan \\nbased on an objective analysis of goals, risk tolerance, and constraints, taking your \\nentire portfolio into account. Review your plan at least once a year as circumstances and \\nasset values may have changed. Having a plan in place helps you counteract investor \\nbiases. \\nFollowing your investment policy or plan, you determine the capital and asset \\nallocations that can produce your desired return objective and risk tolerance within your \\ndefined constraints. Your asset allocation should provide diversification, a good idea \\nwhatever your investment strategy is. \\nMarket Timing and Technical Analysis \\nAsset bubbles and market crashes are largely a matter of timing. If you could anticipate \\na bubble and invest just before it began and divest just before it burst, you would get '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 328}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  329 \\nmaximum return. That sort of precise timing, however, is nearly impossible to achieve. \\nTo time events precisely, you would constantly have to watch for new information, and \\neven then, the information from different sources may be contradictory, or there may be \\ninformation available to others that you do not have. Taken together, your chances of \\nprofitably timing a bubble or crash are fairly slim. \\nMarket timing was defined in Chapter 12 \"Investing\" as an asset allocation strategy. \\nBecause of the difficulty of predicting asset bubbles and crashes, however, and because \\nof the biases in financial behavior, individual investors typically develop a “buy-and-\\nhold” strategy. You invest in a diversified portfolio that reflects your return objectives \\nand risk tolerance, and you hold on to it. You review the asset allocation periodically so \\nit remains in line with your return and risk preferences or as your constraints shift. You \\nrely on your plan to make progress toward your investment goals and to resist the \\ntemptations that are the subjects of the field of behavioral finance. \\nAs you read in Chapter 12 \"Investing\", a passive investment strategy ignores security \\nselection by using index funds for asset classes. An active strategy, in contrast, involves \\nselecting securities with a view to market timing in the selection of securities and asset \\nallocation. \\nAn investment strategy based on the idea that timing is everything is called technical \\nanalysis. Technical analysis involves analyzing securities in terms of their history, \\nexpressed, for example, in the form of charts of market data such as price and volume. \\nTechnical analysts are sometimes referred to as chartists. Chartists do not consider the \\nintrinsic value of a security— a concern of fundamental analysis. Instead, using \\ncharts of past price changes and returns, technical analysts try to predict a security’s \\nfuture market movement. \\nCandlestick charting, with its dozens of symbols, is used as a way to “see” market timing \\ntrends. It is believed to have been invented by an eighteenth-century Japanese rice \\ntrader named Homma Munehisa.[1]  \\nAlthough charting and technical analysis has its proponents, fundamental analysis of \\nvalue remains essential to investment strategy, along with analyzing information about \\nthe economy, industry, and specific asset. \\nFigure 13.10 A Candlestick Chart Used in Technical Analysis[2]  '),\n",

Each symbol annotating the graph, such as the shaded and clear \\n“candlesticks,” represents financial data. Chartists interpret the patterns they see on \\nthese charts as indicators of future price moves and returns as driven by traders’ \\nfinancial behavior. \\nFinancial Fraud \\nFraud is certainly not an investment strategy, but bubbles attract fraudulent schemers \\nas well as investors and speculators. A loss of market efficiency and signs of greater \\ninvestor irrationality attract con men to the markets. It is easier to convince a “mark” of \\nthe credibility and viability of a fraudulent scheme when there is general prosperity, \\nrising asset values, and lower perceived risks. \\nDuring the post–World War I expansion and stock bubble of the 1920s, for example, \\nCharles Ponzi created the first Ponzi scheme, a variation of the classic \\npyramid scheme. The pyramid scheme creates “returns” from new members’ deposits \\nrather than from real earnings in the market. The originator gets a number of people to \\ninvest, each of whom recruits more, and so on. The money from each group of investors, \\nhowever, rather than being invested, is used to pay “returns” to the previous group of \\ninvestors. The scheme is uncovered when there are not enough “returns” to go around. \\nThus, the originator and early investors may get rich, while later investors lose all their \\nmoney. \\nDuring the prosperity of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, the American financier Bernard \\nMadoff notoriously ran a variation of the Ponzi scheme. His fraud, costing investors \\naround the world billions of dollars, lasted through several stock bubbles and a real \\nestate bubble before being exposed in 2008. \\nFraud can be perpetrated at the corporate level as well. Enron Corporation was an \\ninnovator in developing markets for energy commodities such as oil, natural gas, and \\nelectricity. Its image was of a model corporation that encouraged bright thinkers to go \\n'),\n",

By the time the company declared bankruptcy, its \\nstock value was less than one dollar per share, and its major corporate officers were \\nunder indictment (and later convicted) for fraud. \\nHow can you avoid a fraud? Unfortunately, there are no foolproof rules. You can be alert \\nto the investment advisor who pushes a particular investment (see Chapter 14 \"The \\nPractice of Investment\"). You can do your own research and gather as much \\nindependent information on the investment as possible. The best advice, however, may \\ncome in the adage, “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.” The capital markets \\nare full of buyers and sellers of capital who are serious traders. The chances are \\nextremely slim that any one of them has discovered a market inefficiency undiscoverable \\nby others and exploitable only by him or her. There is too much at stake. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Market timing, or the ability to predict bubbles and crashes, is nearly impossible because of \\ndiscrepancies in the \\no availability of information, \\no access to information, \\no interpretation of information. \\n• Technical analysis is a strategy based on market timing and investor sentiment.  \\n• Asset bubbles are often accompanied by an increase in investor fraud due to the  \\no loss of market efficiency, \\no increase in investor “irrationality,” \\no increase in wealth and prosperity. \\n• One form of financial fraud relating to market bubbles is the Ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme.  \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Whether \\nyou entrust a professional advisor or you do it yourself— or both— depends on your \\nconfidence, knowledge, and the time and effort that you want to devote to your \\ndecisions. As is true of any personal finance decision, the ultimate responsibility for and \\nconsequences of your decisions are yours alone. Whatever you decide, the more you \\nknow about the practice of investment, the better an investor you will be. \\nThere are four broad areas to take into account: (1) how to find and evaluate the \\ninformation you need, (2) the agents and fees involved in securities trading, (3) the \\nethical standards and regulatory requirements of the securities industry, and (4) the \\nspecial considerations of investing internationally. \\n14.1 Investment Information \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Explain how leading economic indicators are used to gauge the current economic cycle and the \\noutlook for the economy. \\n2. Explain how indexes are used to gauge financial market activity and as benchmarks for asset \\nclasses and industries. \\n3. Identify and evaluate sources of information used to analyze and forecast corporate performance.  \\n4. Sample and evaluate media outlets providing investment information and advice.  \\nInvestment information seems to be everywhere: in print, radio, television, and \\nInternet— 24/7 and global. Successful investors are hailed as gurus and high-profile \\nfinancial news reporters become celebrities. No shortage of commentators and pundits \\nwill analyze every morsel of news, but how can you find useful investment information \\nto make investment decisions? Even more important, how can you find useful \\ninformation that you can trust based on the reliability of its source? \\nYour investment decisions involve asset allocation and security selection. To make those \\ndecisions, you need information that will help you form an idea of the economy, \\nindustry, and company that affect your decisions. The three main kinds of information \\nthat investors use are economic indicators, market indexes, and company performance. '),\n",

Globally, the World Bank tracks similar statistics, which \\nare widely reported in the media as recognized benchmarks of a nation’s economic \\nhealth. \\nIn addition, interest rates are another financial market indicator. Interest rates are \\ntracked intently because so much capital investment, consumer investment (for houses, \\ncars, education), and even daily consumption relies on debt financing. The prime rate, \\nthe lowest available retail interest rate, and average mortgage rates are the most \\ncommonly followed rates. \\nEconomists look at many other factors to measure the economy. The \\nindex of leading economic indicators, published monthly, includes the following: \\n1. The length of the average workweek (in hours) \\n2. Initial weekly claims for unemployment compensation \\n3. New orders placed with manufacturers \\n4. The percentage of companies receiving slower deliveries from suppliers (vendor \\nperformance) \\n5. Contracts and orders for new plants and equipment \\n6. Permits for new housing starts \\n7. The interest rate spread (difference) between the ten-year Treasury bond and the \\nFederal Reserve Funds rate, the “overnight rate” that banks use to lend to each \\nother \\n8. The index of consumer expectations (the University of Michigan Index) \\n9. Change in the value of the index of stock prices (for 500 common stocks) \\n10. Change in the money supply. \\nAll these measures indicate how productive the economy is, how successful it is at \\ncreating jobs and incomes, and how much benefit it can create for consumers. A decline \\nin the leading indicators for three consecutive months is thought to be a strong sign that \\nthe economy is in a downturn or even heading toward a recession. \\nMarket Information '),\n",

Most \\nindustries have online trade journals and magazines that can give you an idea of \\nindustry activity, optimism, and overall health. Another source are companies that \\nspecialize in research and analysis of industry and company data, such as Hoover’s \\n(http://www.hoovers.com) or Value Line (http://www.valueline.com). \\nWhen professionals analyze a company for its investment potential, they look first at \\nfinancial statements. You can access this data as well, because all publicly traded \\ncorporations must file both annual and quarterly financial reports with the U.S. \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Those files are then made available on the \\nSEC’s Web site (http://www.sec.gov/edgar) through Electronic Data Gathering and \\nRetrieval (EDGAR), the SEC’s data bank. The annual reports (10-Ks) are audited, and \\nthe quarterly reports (10-Qs) are unaudited, but both have to show the company’s \\nfinancial statements and report on important developments and plans or explain \\nunusual financial results. \\nThe 10-K and the 10-Q can give you a good sense of what and how the company has \\nbeen doing or planning for the future. Similar corporate information may be found in \\nthe company’s annual report, sent to shareholders and also available on the company’s \\nWeb site. \\nAn annual report is a narrative of how the company is doing. It includes financial \\nstatements, dated at least two years back so that you can see the company’s progress. It \\nalso includes a discussion, presented by the company’s management, of the company’s \\nstrategic plans, competitive environment, industry outlook, particular risk exposures, \\nand so on. You can get a good sense of how well positioned the company is going \\nforward from an annual report or 10-K. \\nEvaluating Sources of Information \\nInvestment information is readily available. Accessing that information is easy, but \\nevaluating its reliability may be difficult, along with knowing how to use it. It is \\nimportant to distinguish between objective news and subjective commentary. A reporter \\nshould be providing unbiased information, while a commentator is providing a \\nsubjective analysis of it. A news article ideally conveys objective facts, while an editorial \\nor opinion provides subjective commentary. Both kinds of “news” appear in all kinds of \\nmedia, such as print, radio, television, and the Internet. Most print publications have \\ncontinually updated Web sites, some with streaming video, and there are financial social \\nnetworks and blogs providing online discussion and observation. \\nAs you explore the sources of financial news, you will develop a sense of which ones are \\nthe most useful to you.

Identify the important differences between types of investment agents.  \\n2. Describe the different levels of service offered by investment agents.  \\n3. Analyze the different fee and account structures available to investors.  \\n4. Differentiate the types of trading orders and explain their roles in an investment strategy.  \\nThe discussion of investment so far has focused on the ideas behind your investment \\nplan, but to be useful to you, your plan has to be implemented. You have to invest, and \\nthen, over time, trade. How do you access the capital markets? How and when do you \\nbuy, sell, or hold? \\nTo answer these questions you need to know the types of agents who exercise trades in \\nthe financial markets; the types of services, accounts, and fees they offer; and the kinds \\nof trading orders they execute on your behalf. \\nAgents: Brokers and Dealers \\nThe markets or exchanges for stocks, bonds, commodities, or funds are membership \\norganizations. Unless you are a member of the exchange, you cannot trade on the \\nexchange without hiring an agent to execute trades for you. Trading essentially is buying \\nand selling. \\nAs you’ve read in Chapter 12 \"Investing\", a broker is an agent who trades on behalf of \\nclients to fulfill client directives. A dealer is a firm that is trading for its own account. \\nMany firms act as broker-dealers, trading on behalf of both clients and the firm’s \\naccount. Many brokers, dealers, and broker-dealers are independent firms, but many \\nare subsidiaries or operations of large investment banks, commercial banks, or \\ninvestment companies. \\nFirms may offer different levels of brokerage services: '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 342}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  343 \\n• Discretionary trading means that the broker is empowered to make \\ninvestment decisions and trades on behalf of the client. \\n• Advisory dealing means that the broker provides advice and guidance to the \\nclient, but investment decisions remain with the client. \\n• Execution-only service means that the broker’s only role is to execute trades \\nper the investor’s decisions. \\nAlmost all brokerages provide online and mobile access, and most allow you to access \\nyour account information, including trading history, and to place orders and receive \\norder confirmations online. Some discount brokers operate only online, that is, they \\nhave no retail or storefront offices at all. This allows them to lower costs and fees. Most \\nbrokerages still send out hard copies of such information as well. Some also provide \\nresearch reports and tools such as calculators and data for making asset allocation \\ndecisions. \\nFees \\nAs firms offer different levels of service, their compensation or fee structures may vary. \\nA broker is compensated for executing a trade by receiving a commission based on the \\nvolume of the security traded and its price. A discount broker may offer lower \\ncommissions on trades but may provide execution-only services. \\nA firm may offer all levels of service or specialize in just one. Large discount brokers \\nsuch as Fidelity, Scottrade, or Charles Schwab may provide a full range of services along \\nwith execution-only services that charge lower commissions on trades. Other discount \\nbrokers and online-only brokers may charge a lower flat fee per trade, rather than a \\ncommission on the amount of the trade. Some firms charge a commission on trades and \\na fee for advisory or discretionary services. The fee is usually a percentage of the value of \\nthe portfolio. Some charge a flat fee for a quarterly or annual portfolio check-up and \\nadvisory services. \\nBoth the commission-based and the fee-based compensation structures have critics. The \\ncommission-based structure results in more compensation for the broker (and more \\ncost for you) if there are a greater number of trades. This can lead some brokers to \\nengage in excessive trading, called churning— an unwarranted and unnecessary \\namount of trading in your account for which the broker is being compensated. \\nOn the other hand, a fee structure based on a percentage of the value of the assets under \\nmanagement can reward a broker for doing nothing. If the economy expands and asset \\nvalues rise, the value of the portfolio— and therefore the broker’s compensation— may \\nrise without any effort on the broker’s part. \\nThe most economical recourse for an investor is to find a broker who charges a flat fee \\nfor advisory services, independent of portfolio size, and discount fees for commissions \\non trading. The costs of investing and trading depend on how much trading you do and '),\n",

The more of the research and \\nadvisory work you do for yourself, the less your costs should be. \\nBrokerage Accounts \\nTwo basic types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts or margin accounts. With a \\ncash account, you can trade using only the cash you deposit into the account directly \\nor as a result of previous trades, dividends, or interest payments. The cash account is the \\nmost common kind of brokerage account. \\nWith a margin account, you may trade in amounts exceeding the cash available in the \\naccount, in effect borrowing from your broker to complete the financing of the trade. \\nThe investor is said to be “trading on margin.” The broker usually requires a minimum \\nvalue for a margin account and extends credit based on the value of the cash and \\nsecurities in the portfolio. If your portfolio value drops below the minimum-value \\nthreshold, perhaps because securities values have dropped, then you may be faced with \\na margin call. The broker calls on you to deposit more into the account. \\nInvestors pay interest on funds borrowed on margin. As regulated by the Federal \\nReserve, the amount of an investment financed by debt or bought on margin is limited. \\nThe margin requirement is the percentage of the investment’s value that must be \\npaid for in cash. \\nCustodial accounts are accounts created for minors under the federal Uniform Gifts \\nto Minors Act (UGMA) of 1956 or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) of 1986. \\nThe account is legally owned by the minor and is in his or her name, but an adult \\ncustodian must be named for the account. Otherwise, the owner of a brokerage account \\nmust be a legal adult. The account is created at a bank, brokerage firm, or mutual fund \\ncompany and is managed by an adult for an underage child (as defined by the state). \\nEstablishing a brokerage account is as easy as opening a bank account or credit card \\naccount. You will need a good credit rating, especially for a margin account, a reasonable \\nsource of income, and a minimum deposit of assets. Many brokers allow you to transfer \\nassets from another brokerage account with minimal effort. \\nBrokerage Orders \\nYou need not be an expert in the arcane language brokers use to describe trades, so long \\nas you understand the basic types of orders you can request. Say you want to buy a \\nhundred shares of X Corporation’s common stock. You call your broker and ask the \\nprice. The broker says that at this moment, the market is “50 bid-50.25 ask.” Stock \\nexchanges are auction markets; that is, buyers bid what they are willing to pay and \\nsellers ask what they’re willing to accept. If the market is “50 bid-50.25 ask,” this means \\nthat right now the consensus among buyers is that they are willing to pay $50 per share, \\nwhile sellers are willing to accept $50.25. The “bid-ask spread” or difference is 25 cents. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 344}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  345 \\nIf you then place a market order to buy a hundred shares, the order will be executed \\nat the lowest asking price— the least that the seller is willing to accept. In other words, \\nyou will pay $50.25 per share, the asking price, to buy the stock. \\nYou could also place a limit order to buy the shares when the price is lower, say $45 \\nper share (or to sell when the price is higher, say $55), specifying how long the order is \\nin effect. If the price goes down to $45 (or up to $55) within the period of time, then \\nyour limit order will be filled, and otherwise it will not. \\nWhen you buy a security, you are said to have a long position in that security; you own \\nit. You could close out your position by selling it. When you “go long” in a security, you \\nare expecting its value to rise, so that you can buy it for a lower price and then sell it for \\na higher price. \\nAlternatively, you could create a short position in the security by borrowing it from \\nyour broker, selling it, and then buying it back and returning it to your broker at some \\nspecified point in the future. When you “short” a security, you are expecting its value to \\ndecrease, so that you can sell it at a high price and then buy it back at a lower price. \\nOther specialized kinds of orders include a stop-loss order An order to sell a security \\nonce its price has fallen below a specified price., where you direct that the stock be sold \\nwhen it reaches a certain price (below the current price) in order to limit your potential \\nloss if the value decreases. You can use a stop-buy order to buy a stock at a certain \\nprice (above the current price) if you have “shorted” a security and want to limit your \\nloss if its value rises. \\nIf you are following a “buy-and-hold” strategy, you are establishing positions that you \\nplan to hold for a long time. With this strategy you probably will do well to use a market \\norder. Over the long term that you hold your position, the daily fluctuations in price \\nwon’t matter. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• A broker trades on behalf of clients; a dealer trades for its own account, and a broker- dealer does \\nboth. \\n• Brokers, dealers, and broker-dealers may be independent firms or subsidiaries of investment \\nbanks, commercial banks, or investment companies. \\n• Firms may offer several levels of brokerage services, defining their roles as active manager, \\nadvisor, and/or traders: \\no discretionary trading, \\no advisory dealing, '),\n",

Discuss the reasons that investing behavior may be unethical. \\n2. Identify the key professional responsibilities of investment agents.  \\n3. Describe practices that investment agents should pursue or avoid to fulfill their professional \\nresponsibilities. \\n4. Explain how investment agents are regulated. \\n5. Debate the role of government oversight in the securities industry.  \\nFinancial markets, perhaps more than most, seem to seduce otherwise good citizens into \\nunethical or even illegal behavior. There are several reasons: \\n1. Investing is a complex, volatile, and unpredictable process, such that the \\ncomplexity of the process lowers the probability of getting caught. \\n2. The stakes are high enough and the probability of getting caught is low enough so \\nthat the benefits can easily seem to outweigh the costs. The benefits can even \\nblind participants to the costs of getting caught. \\n3. The complexity of the situation may allow some initial success, and the unethical \\ninvestor or broker becomes overconfident, encouraging more unethical behavior. \\n4. Employers may put their employees under pressure to act in the company’s \\ninterests rather than clients’ interests. \\nTo counteract these realities there are three forces at work: market forces, professional \\nstandards, and legal restrictions. But before these topics are discussed, it is useful to \\nreview the differences between ethical and unethical, or professional and \\nunprofessional, behaviors in this context. '),\n",

In carrying out \\nthese responsibilities, they should demonstrate appropriate professional conduct. \\nProfessional conduct is ethical, that is, it is based on moral principles of right and wrong \\nas expressed in the profession’s standards of conduct. \\nBrokers and advisors should always deal objectively and fairly with clients, putting \\nclients’ interests before their own. In other words, a broker should always give higher \\npriority to the client’s wealth than to his or her own. When acting on a client’s behalf, a \\nbroker should always be aware of the trust that has been placed on him or her and act \\nwith prudence and care. The principle of due diligence stipulates, for example, that \\ninvestment advisors and brokers must investigate and report to the investor every detail \\nof a potential investment. \\nKim receives an order from a client to sell shares because the client believes the stock \\nprice will drop. Kim believes the client is right and so decides to sell her own personal \\nshares in that stock as well. She places the order to sell her shares first, so that if the \\nprice drops as she sells, her shares will be sold at a higher price. She places the order to \\nsell the client’s shares after the price has dropped. This practice of taking advantage of \\nthe client by not putting the client first is called front-running. According to \\nprofessional ethics, Kim should be putting her client’s interest— and order— ahead of her \\nown. \\nProfessional ethics call for brokers and advisors to disclose any potential conflicts of \\ninterest they may have. They also should be diligent and thorough when researching \\ninvestments and making recommendations and should have an objective basis for their \\nadvice. Investment recommendations should be suitable for the client, and advice \\nshould be given with the best interests of the client in mind. \\nShonte is a financial advisor for a large broker-dealer that has acquired a large position \\nin a certain bond issue. It now owns a lot of bonds. Wanting to reduce the company’s \\nexposure to risk from that position, Shonte’s boss suggests that whenever possible, she \\nshould advise her clients to add this bond to their portfolios. That way the company can \\nuse its clients to buy its bonds and reduce its position. This conduct is unethical, \\nhowever. Shonte should not automatically recommend the bond to all her clients, \\nbecause her advice should be based solely on the individual clients’ interests and needs, \\nnot the company’s. \\nAn advisor or broker should \\n• be forthcoming about how the investment analysis was done and the changes or \\nevents could affect the outcome; \\n• not present himself or herself as a “guru” with a special or secret method of \\ndivining investment opportunities; '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 348}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  349 \\n• clearly explain the logic and grounding for all judgments and advice; \\n• not try to pressure you into making an investment decision or use threats or scare \\ntactics to influence you; \\n• communicate regularly and clearly with you about your portfolio performance \\nand any market or economic changes that may affect its performance. \\nIn addition to being loyal to clients, brokers and advisors are expected to be loyal to \\nemployers, the professions, and the financial markets. Accepting side deals, gifts, or \\n“kickbacks,” for example, may damage a company’s reputation, harm colleagues as well \\nas clients, and betray the profession. Loyalty to market integrity is shown by keeping the \\nmarkets competitive and fair. For example, brokers should use only information \\navailable to all. Information from private sources to which others do not have access is \\ninside information, and making trades on the basis of inside information is called \\ninsider trading. \\nFor example, Jorge, a broker, just found out from a client that the company she works \\nfor is about to be granted a patent for a new product. The information has not yet been \\nannounced publicly, but it will almost certainly increase the value of the company’s \\nstock. Jorge is tempted to buy the stock immediately, before the news breaks, both for \\nhis employer’s account and his own. He would almost surely profit and gain points with \\nhis boss as well. But that would be wrong. Trading on inside information would be \\ndisloyal to the integrity of the markets, and it is illegal. \\nBrokers and advisors should not manipulate markets or try to influence or distort prices \\nto mislead market participants. Attempts to do so have become more widespread with \\nthe tremendous growth of electronic communications. For example, Tom, a dealer, has \\njust shorted a large position in a tech stock. On his widely read blog, he announces that \\nhis “research” has revealed serious weaknesses in the tech company’s marketing strategy \\nand rumors of competitors’ greater advantages in the market. Tom has no factual basis \\nfor his reporting, but if his “news” causes the price of the tech stock to fall, he will profit \\nfrom his short position. Tom’s attempts to manipulate the market are unethical and \\nunprofessional. \\nRegulation of Advisors, Brokers, and Dealers \\nIt is often said that the financial markets are self-regulating and self-policing. Market \\nforces may be effective in correcting or preventing unprofessional conduct, but they \\noften don’t, so there are also professional and legal sanctions. \\nSanctions provide deterrence and punishment. Registered brokers and advisors, and \\ntheir firms, typically are members of professional organizations with regulatory powers. \\nFor example, professional organizations have qualifications for membership and may \\naward credentials or accreditation that their members would not want to lose. '),\n",

However, keep in mind \\nthat no professional affiliation or designation is required to give investment advice. \\nThe U.S. securities industry is formally regulated by federal and state governments. \\nGovernment sanctions and limits have been imposed gradually, usually after a major \\nmarket failure or scandal, and so form a collection of rules and laws overseen by a \\nvariety of agencies. \\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a federal government agency \\nempowered to oversee the trading of securities and the exchanges in the capital markets. \\nIt was created in 1934 in response to the behavior that precipitated the stock market \\ncrash in 1929 and the subsequent failure of the banking system. The SEC investigates \\nillegal activities such as trading on insider information, front-running, fraud, and \\nmarket manipulation. \\nThe SEC also requires information disclosures to inform the public about companies’ \\nfinancial performance and business strategy. Investors must report to the SEC their \\nintention to acquire more than 5 percent of a company’s shares, and business executives \\nmust report to the SEC when they buy or sell shares in their own company. The SEC \\nthen tries to minimize the use of insider information by making it publicly available. \\nThe SEC delegates authority to self-regulatory organizations (SROs), such as the \\nNational Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and the national stock exchanges, \\nsuch as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). NASD and the exchanges uphold \\nindustry standards and compliance requirements for trading securities and operating \\nbrokerages. \\nIn 2007, the SEC created a new SRO that reincorporated the NASD, renamed as the \\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA’s job is to focus exclusively on \\nthe enforcement of rules governing the securities industry. In addition, Congress created \\nthe Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) as an SRO. The MSRB’s job is to \\ncreate rules to protect investors involved with broker-dealers and banks that trade in \\ntax-exempt bonds and 529 college savings plans. \\nFigure 14.6 \"Regulatory Environment of the U.S. Securities Industry\" shows the \\nstructure of the securities industry’s regulatory environment. \\nFigure 14.6 Regulatory Environment of the U.S. Securities Industry '),\n",

When investment \\nbrokering and advising are services of investment or commercial banks, their actions \\nmay fall under the control of both the SEC and the Fed, as well as state banking and \\ninsurance regulators. States license investment agents. Also, each state’s attorney \\ngeneral is responsible for investigating securities violations in that state. \\nGovernment regulation of capital markets has long been a contentious issue in the \\nUnited States. During periods of expansion and rising asset prices, there is less call for \\nregulation and enforcement. Clients and investment agents may have fewer complaints \\nbecause of investment gains and increasing earnings. When a bubble bursts or there is a \\ntrue financial crisis, however, then investors demand protections and enforcement. \\nFor example, after the stock market crash in 1929 and the widespread bank failures of \\n1930–1933, the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933 to establish the Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) and take measures to reduce market speculation. A \\nsecond Glass-Steagall Act, which was passed the same year and officially named the \\nBanking Act of 1933, separated investment and commercial banking to reduce potential \\nconflicts of interest when a bank is issuing securities for a firm that it is also lending to. \\nIn 1999, however, after years of economic expansion and at the height of the tech stock \\nbubble, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act effectively repealed the Banking Act of 1933, \\nopening the way for the consolidation of the banking industry. This consolidation led to \\nthe introduction of “one-stop-shopping” banks, which provide investment, commercial, \\nand retail banking services all under one roof. \\nThe financial and banking crisis that began in 2007 led to calls for increased regulation \\nand a larger role for the federal and state governments in regulating the banking and \\nsecurities industries. While history shows that the kinds of regulation and amount of \\ngovernment oversight vary, there clearly will always be a role for federal and state \\ngovernment regulators. \\nInvestor Protection \\n'),\n",

If the offending agent is working for a \\nbrokerage firm or bank, a complaint to a superior is sometimes all that is needed. The \\nfirm would prefer not to risk its reputation for one “bad apple.” \\nIf you are not satisfied, however, you can lodge a formal complaint with a professional \\norganization such as the relevant SRO. The SROs have standard procedures in place and \\nwill investigate your complaint. If necessary, the offender will be punished by a \\nsuspension or permanent removal of his or her professional designation or certification. \\nYou can also complain to the SEC or a state or federal consumer protection agency, file \\nsuit in civil court, or press for a criminal complaint. Due to their complexities, \\ninvestment cases are often somewhat difficult to prove, so you should consult with an \\nattorney who is experienced with such cases. Often when a broker or advisor has used \\nillegal practices, she or he has done so with more than one client. When you are not the \\nonly victim, the state or federal prosecutor or your lawyer may choose to bring a class \\naction suit on behalf of all the client-victims. \\nAs always, the best defense is to take care in choosing an investment advisor or broker. \\nMost investment agents are chosen by word of mouth, recommendations from trusted \\nfamily members, friends, or colleagues who have been satisfied clients. Before you \\nchoose, check with the professional organization with which he or she claims affiliation \\nor certification and review any records of past complaints or offenses.

Identify the unusual risks of foreign investing compared to domestic investing.  \\n2. Discuss the use of the Economic Freedom Index. \\n3. Explain the role of international investments in an investment strategy. \\nInvesting is global. While the financial markets and the capital markets may resemble a \\nglobal village, it is also true that investing in assets governed by foreign standards and \\nregulations creates additional concerns. \\nInvestments in foreign securities are used to diversify an investment portfolio’s \\neconomic risk. The United States, most nations in Europe, and Japan have highly \\ndeveloped economies. Other economies may be developing, such as India and China, or \\nmay be emerging, such as Nigeria and Bolivia, and may be using different strategies to \\nachieve different rates of growth. The world economy is truly global, however, because \\nalthough different economies may be in different stages of development, they are all \\nintimately linked through trade. \\nDifferent economies offer different kinds of opportunities because of where they are in \\ntheir progress toward free-market economic diversification and stability. Along with \\ndifferent opportunities, however, they also offer different risks. \\nThese risks run the gamut from the challenge of interpreting information correctly to \\nthe risk that too much or too little regulation will interfere with market forces. \\nInternational investing also embodies risks relating to foreign markets, economies, \\ncurrencies, and politics. \\nInvestment Information \\nA general concern in international investing is the flow and quality of information. You \\nmake investment decisions by gathering and evaluating information. That information \\nis useful to you because you know how to interpret it, because you know the \\nstandardized way in which that information was gathered and prepared. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 355}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  356 \\nIn the United States, financial statements are prepared using Generally Accepted \\nAccounting Principles or GAAP, the rules that frame accounting judgments. Those \\nstatements may then be audited by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to \\nassure that the accounting rules have been followed. \\nIn other countries, however, accountants do not use GAAP but prepare financial \\nstatements by somewhat different rules. Some of those differences relate significantly to \\nasset valuations, a key factor in your decision to invest. When you read financial reports \\nwritten for foreign companies, therefore, you need to remain mindful that they are \\nwritten under different rules and may not mean the same as financial reports following \\nthe U.S. GAAP. At the very least, you should determine whether the statements you are \\nreading were independently audited. \\nOther countries also have different standards and procedures for making information \\navailable to investors. One reason that the SEC requires filings of annual and quarterly \\nreports is to make information publicly and readily available. Other countries may not \\nhave such corporate filing requirements. Information may be harder to get, and the \\ninformation that you do get may not be as complete or as uniform. \\nOther kinds of information are also important. A good brokerage or advisory firm will \\nhave analysts and researchers “on the ground,” tracking economic and cultural \\ninfluences in foreign countries as well as corporations with promising earnings. \\nMarket, Economic, and Currency Risks \\nUnless a foreign security is listed on an American exchange, you or your broker will have \\nto purchase it through a foreign exchange. In the United States, a substantial volume of \\ntrade keeps markets liquid, except in relatively rare times of crisis. This may not be true \\non some foreign exchanges. In active major capital markets such as in Western Europe \\nand Japan, there will be plenty of liquidity, but in some emerging markets, such as in \\nAfrica, there may not be. This means that your risk in holding an investment increases, \\nbecause you may find it difficult to sell when you want to, just because the market is not \\nliquid at that time. \\nMarket risk also affects pricing. Market liquidity and the volume of trade helps the \\nmarket to function more efficiently in the pricing of assets, so you are more likely to get \\na favorable price when trading. \\nForeign investments are often used to diversify domestic investments just because \\nforeign economies are different. They may be in different business cycles or in different \\nstages of development. While the United States has a long-established, developed \\nmarket economy, other countries may have emerging market economies with less \\ncapitalization and less experience in market-driven economic patterns. \\nOther economies also have different strengths and weaknesses, sources of growth and \\nvulnerabilities. The U.S. economy is fairly well-diversified, whereas another economy '),\n",

Prospects for economic growth may differ based on health care \\nand education, tax policies, and trade policies. You want to be sure that your investment \\nis in an economy that can nurture or at least accommodate growth. \\nPerhaps the greatest risk in international investing is currency risk, risk to the value \\nof the foreign currency. To invest overseas, you may have to use foreign currency, and \\nyou receive your return in foreign currency. When you change the foreign currency back \\ninto your own currency, differences in the values of the currencies— the exchange rate—\\ncould make your return more or less valuable. \\nTim decides to invest in a French business when the exchange rate between the euro \\n(France) and the dollar (U.S.) is €1.00 = $1.00. So, Tim buys €1,000 of the French \\ncompany’s stock for $1,000 (assuming no transaction costs for the currency exchange or \\nfor broker’s fees). One year goes by and Tim decides to sell the stock. The stock is the \\nsame price, €1,000, but the exchange rate has changed. Now €1.00 = $0.87. If Tim sells \\nhis stock, even though its value has not changed, his €1,000 will only come to $870. Tim \\nhas incurred a loss, not because the value of the investment decreased, but because the \\nvalue of his currency did. \\nThe exchange rate between two currencies fluctuates, depending on many \\nmacroeconomic factors in each economy. At times there can be considerable volatility. \\nExchange rates are especially affected by inflation, especially when the spread in \\nexchange rates between two countries is greater. When you are investing abroad, \\nconsider the time period you expect to hold your investment and the outlook for \\nexchange rate fluctuations during that period. \\nPolitical Risks \\nGovernments protect an economy and participate in it as both consumers and \\nproducers. The extent to which they do so is a major difference among governments and \\ntheir economies. \\nThe government’s role in an economy influences its growth potential. When investing in \\na foreign company, you should consider the government’s effect on its growth. \\nEconomic and political stability are important indicators for growth. \\nBecause investing is long term, investors try to predict an investment’s performance, \\nand forecasting requires a stable context. The type of economy or government is less \\nrelevant than its relative stability. A country given to economic upheaval or with a \\nhistory of weak governments or high government turnover is a less stable environment \\nfor investment. \\nMarket-based economies thrive when markets thrive, so anything the government does \\nto support markets will foster a better environment for investing. While some market \\nregulation is helpful, too much may work against market liquidity and thus investors. A '),\n",

They were typically the size of a large \\nroom and just as expensive. To use one, you had to learn a programming language. On \\nApril 1, 1976, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron Wayne started a company to make \\npersonal computers. On January 3, 1977, Jobs and Wozniak incorporated without \\nWayne, buying his 10-percent share of the company for $800.[1]  \\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple Computer, Inc., went public; its stock sold for $22 per \\nshare.[2]  \\nHad you bought Apple’s stock when the company went public and held it until today, \\nyou would have earned an annual return of about 14.5 percent. To look at it another \\nway, $1,000 invested in Apple shares when they went public would be worth over \\n$50,000 today.[3]  \\nHistory, as much as it is a litany of wars and rulers struggling for power, is a story of \\ninvention and innovation, broadening our understanding of how the world works and, if \\nsuccessful, improving the quality of our lives.

The steam engine, the light bulb, the \\ntelephone— and the personal computer— had to be produced and sold to be widely used \\nand useful. \\nTypically, an inventor has a great idea, then teams up with— or becomes— an \\nentrepreneur.

When the \\nloan matures and is paid off, the relationship is over. \\nIf the costs of debt are too high, however, or the company is unable to borrow, it seeks \\nequity investors willing to contribute capital in exchange for an unspecified share of the \\ncompany’s profits at some time in the future. In exchange for taking the risk of no exact \\nreturn on their investment, equity investors get a say in how the company is run. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 362}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  363 \\nStock represents those shares in the company’s future and the right to a say in how the \\ncompany is run. The original owners— the inventor(s) and entrepreneur(s)— choose \\nequity investors who share their ideals and vision for the company. Usually, the first \\nequity investors are friends, family, or colleagues, allowing the original owners freedom \\nof management. At that point, the corporation is privately held, and the company’s stock \\nmay be traded privately between owners. There may be restrictions on selling the stock, \\noften the case for a family business, so that control stays within the family. \\nIf successful, however, eventually the company needs more capital to grow and remain \\ncompetitive. If debt is not desirable, then the company issues more equity, or stock, to \\nraise capital. The company may seek out an angel investor, venture capital firm, or \\nprivate equity firm. Such investors finance companies in the early stages in exchange \\nfor a large ownership and management stake in the company. Their strategy is to buy a \\nsignificant stake when the company is still “private” and then realize a large gain, \\ntypically when the company goes public. The company also may seek a buyer, perhaps a \\ncompetitive or complementary business. \\nAlternatively, the company may choose to go public, to sell shares of ownership to \\ninvestors in the public markets. Theoretically, this means sharing control with random \\nstrangers because anyone can purchase shares traded in the stock market. It may even \\nmean losing control of the company. Founders can be fired, as Steve Jobs was from \\nApple in 1985 (although he returned as CEO in 1996). \\nGoing public requires a profound shift in the corporate structure and management. \\nOnce a company is publicly traded, it falls under the regulatory scrutiny of federal and \\nstate governments, and must regularly file financial reports and analysis. It must \\nbroaden participation on the board of directors and allow more oversight of \\nmanagement. Companies go public to raise large amounts of capital to expand products, \\noperations, markets, or to improve or create competitive advantages. To raise public \\nequity capital, companies need to sell stock, and to sell stock they need a market. That’s \\nwhere the stock markets come in. \\nPrimary and Secondary Markets \\nThe private corporation’s board of directors, shareholders elected by the shareholders, \\nmust authorize the number of shares that can be issued. Since issuing shares means \\nopening up the company to more owners, or sharing it more, only the existing owners \\nhave the authority to do so. Usually, it authorizes more shares than it intends to issue, so \\nit has the option of issuing more as need be. \\nThose authorized shares are then issued through an initial public offering (IPO). \\nAt that point the company goes public. The IPO is a primary market transaction, \\nwhich occurs when the stock is initially sold and the proceeds go to the company issuing \\nthe stock. After that, the company is publicly traded; its stock is outstanding, or publicly \\navailable. Then, whenever the stock changes hands, it is a secondary market '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 363}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  364 \\ntransaction. The owner of the stock may sell shares and realize the proceeds. When most \\npeople think of “the stock market,” they are thinking of the secondary markets. \\nThe existence of secondary markets makes the stock a liquid or tradable asset, which \\nreduces its risk for both the issuing company and the investor buying it. The investor is \\ngiving up capital in exchange for a share of the company’s profit, with the risk that there \\nwill be no profit or not enough to compensate for the opportunity cost of sacrificing the \\ncapital. The secondary markets reduce that risk to the shareholder because the stock can \\nbe resold, allowing the shareholder to recover at least some of the invested capital and to \\nmake new choices with it. \\nMeanwhile, the company issuing the stock must pay the investor for assuming some of \\nits risk. The less that risk is, because of the liquidity provided by the secondary markets, \\nthe less the company has to pay. The secondary markets decrease the company’s cost of \\nequity capital. \\nA company hires an investment bank to manage its initial public offering of stock. For \\nefficiency, the bank usually sells the IPO stock to institutional investors. Usually, the \\noriginal owners of the corporation keep large amounts of stock as well. \\nWhat does this mean for individual investors? Some investors believe that after an \\ninitial public offering of stock, the share price will rise because the investment bank will \\nhave initially underpriced the stock in order to sell it. This is not always the case, \\nhowever. Share price is typically more volatile after an initial public offering than it is \\nafter the shares have been outstanding for a while. The longer the company has been \\npublic, the more information is known about the company, and the more predictable its \\nearnings are and thus share price.[1]  \\nWhen a company goes public, it may issue a relatively small number of shares. Its \\nmarket capitalization— the total dollar value of its outstanding shares— may \\ntherefore be small. The number of individual shareholders, mostly institutional \\ninvestors and the original owners, also may be small. As a result, the shares may be \\n“thinly traded,” traded infrequently or in small amounts. \\nThinly traded shares may add to the volatility of the share price. One large shareholder \\ndeciding to sell could cause a decrease in the stock price, for example, whereas for a \\ncompany with many shares and shareholders, the actions of any one shareholder would \\nnot be significant. As always, diversification— in this case of shareholders— decreases \\nrisk. Thinly traded shares are less liquid and more risky than shares that trade more \\nfrequently. \\nCommon, Preferred, and Foreign Stocks \\nA company may issue common stock or preferred stock. Common stock is more \\nprevalent. All companies issue common stock, whereas not all issue preferred stock. The '),\n",

After several corporate \\nscandals in the early twenty-first century, some shareholders have become more active \\nin their voting role. \\nCommon stockholders assume the most risk of any corporate investor. If the company \\nencounters financial distress, its first responsibility is to satisfy creditors, then the \\npreferred shareholders, and then the common shareholders. Thus, common stocks \\nprovide only residual claims on the value of the company. In the event of bankruptcy, in \\nother words, common shareholders get only the residue— whatever is left after all other \\nclaimants have been compensated. \\nCommon shareholders share the company’s profit after interest has been paid to \\ncreditors and a specified share of the profit has been paid to preferred shareholders. \\nCommon shareholders may receive all or part of the profit in cash— the dividend. The \\ncompany is under no obligation to pay common stock dividends, however. The \\nmanagement may decide that the profit is better used to expand the company, to invest \\nin new products or technologies, or to grow by acquiring a competitor. As a result, the \\ncompany may pay a cash dividend only in certain years or not at all. \\nShareholders investing in preferred stock, on the other hand, give up voting rights but \\nget less risk and more dividends. Preferred stock typically does not convey voting rights \\nto the shareholder. It is often distributed to the “friends and family” of the original \\nfounders when the company goes public, allowing them to share in the company’s \\nprofits without having a say in its management. As noted above, preferred shareholders \\nhave a superior claim on the company’s assets in the event of bankruptcy. They get their \\noriginal investment back before common shareholders but after creditors. \\nPreferred dividends are more of an obligation than common dividends. Most preferred \\nshares are issued with a fixed dividend as cumulative preferred shares. This means \\nthat if the company does not create enough profit to pay its preferred dividends, those \\ndividends ultimately must be paid before any common stock dividend. \\nFor the individual investor, preferred stock may have two additional advantages over \\ncommon stock: \\n1. Less volatile prices \\n2. More reliable dividends \\nAs the company goes through its ups and downs, the preferred stock price will fluctuate \\nless than the common stock price. If the company does poorly, preferred stockholders \\nare more likely to be able to recoup more of their original investment than common '),\n",

If the company does well, however, \\npreferred stockholders are less likely to share more in its success because their dividend \\nis fixed. Preferred shareholders thus are exposed to less risk, protected by their superior \\nclaim and fixed dividend. The preferred stock price reflects less of the company’s \\nvolatility. \\nBecause the preferred dividend is more of an obligation than the common dividend, it \\nprovides more predictable dividend income for shareholders. This makes the preferred \\nstock less risky and attractive to an investor looking for less volatility and more regular \\ndividend income. \\nFigure 15.3 \"Stock Comparisons\" summarizes the differences between common stock \\nand preferred stock. \\nFigure 15.3 Stock Comparisons \\n \\nAs an investment choice, preferred stock is more comparable to bonds than to common \\nstock. Bonds also offer less volatility and more reliable income than common stock (see \\nChapter 16 \"Owning Bonds\"). If there is a difference in the tax rate between dividend \\nincome (from preferred stock) and interest income (from bonds), you may find a tax \\nadvantage to investing in preferred stock instead of bonds. \\nCorporations often issue and trade their stocks on exchanges or in markets outside their \\nhome country, especially if the foreign market has more liquidity and will attract more \\nbuyers. Many foreign corporations issue and trade stock on the New York Stock \\nExchange (NYSE) or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated \\nQuotations (NASDAQ), for example. \\nInvesting in foreign shares is complicated by the fact that stock represents ownership, a \\nlegal as well as an economic idea, and because foreign companies operate in foreign \\ncurrencies. To get around those issues and make foreign shares more tradable, the \\nAmerican Depository Receipt (ADR) was created in 1927. U.S. banks buy large \\namounts of shares in a foreign company and then sell ADRs (each representing a \\n'),\n",

Individual shares of the stock are \\ncalled American Depository Shares, or ADSs. \\nThe ADR is usually listed on a major U.S. stock exchange, such as the New York Stock \\nExchange, or is quoted on the NASDAQ. One ADR can represent more or less than one \\nshare of the foreign stock, depending on its price and the currency exchange rate, so that \\nthe bank issuing the ADR can “price” it according to the norms of U.S. stock markets. \\nADRs lower transaction costs for U.S. investors investing in foreign corporations. \\nBecause they are denominated in U.S. dollars, they lower exchange rate or currency risk \\nfor U.S. investors. They also lower your usual risks with investing overseas, such as lack \\nof information and too much or too little regulatory oversight. \\nIn return for marketing their shares in the lucrative U.S. market, foreign companies \\nmust provide U.S. banks with detailed financial reports. This puts available foreign \\ncorporate information on par with that of U.S. companies. Because they are issued and \\nsold in the United States on U.S. exchanges, ADRs fall under the regulatory control of \\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other federal and state regulatory \\nagencies, which also lowers your risk. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Companies go public to raise capital to finance growth by selling equity shares in the public \\nmarkets. \\n• A primary market transaction happens between the original issuer and buyer.  \\n• Secondary market transactions are between all subsequent sellers and buyers. \\n• The secondary market lowers risk and transaction costs by increasing liquidity.  \\n• Shares are authorized and issued and then become outstanding or publicly available.  \\n• Equity securities may be common or preferred stock, differing by \\no the assignment of voting rights, \\no dividend obligations, \\no claims in case of bankruptcy, \\no risk. \\n• Common stocks have less predictable income, whereas most preferred stocks have fixed -rate \\ncumulative dividends. \\n• ADRs represent foreign shares traded in U.S. markets, lowering risks, such as currency risks, and \\ntransaction costs for U.S. investors.

Explain how stocks can be characterized by their expected performance r elative to the market. \\nThe value of a stock is in its ability to create a return, to create income or a gain in value \\nfor the investor. With common stock, the income is in the form of a dividend, which the \\ncompany is not obligated to pay. The potential gain is determined by estimations of the \\nfuture value of the stock. \\nIf you knew that the future value would likely be more than the current market price—\\nover your transaction costs, tax consequences, and opportunity cost— then you would \\nbuy the stock. \\nIf you thought the future value would be less, you would short the stock (borrow it to sell \\nwith the intent of buying it back when its price falls), or you would just look for another \\ninvestment. \\nEvery investor wants to know what a stock will be worth, which is why so many stock \\nanalysts spend so much time estimating future value. Equity analysis is the process of \\ngathering as much information as possible and making the most educated guesses. \\nCorporations exist to make profit for the owners. The better a corporation is at doing \\nthat, the more valuable it is, and the more valuable are its shares. A company also needs \\nto increase earnings, or grow, because the global economy is competitive. A \\ncorporation’s future value depends on its ability to create and grow earnings. \\nThat ability depends on many factors. Some factors are company-specific, some are \\nspecific to the industry or sector, and some are macroeconomic forces. Chapter 12 \\n\"Investing\" discussed these factors in terms of the risk that a stock creates for the \\ninvestor. The risk is that the company will not be able to earn the expected profit. \\nA company’s size is an indicator of its earnings and growth potential. Size may correlate \\nwith age. A large company typically is more mature than a smaller one, for example. A \\nlarger company may have achieved economies of scale or may have gotten large by \\neliminating competitors or dominating its market. Size in itself is not an indicator of \\nsuccess, but similarly sized companies tend to have similar earnings growth.[1]  \\nCompanies are usually referred to by the size of their market capitalization or market \\ncap, that is, the current market value of the debt and equity they use to finance their \\nassets. Common market cap categories are the sizes micro, small, mid (medium), and \\nlarge, or \\n• micro cap, with a market capitalization of less than $300 million; \\n• small cap, with a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion; \\n• mid cap, with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion; \\n• large cap, with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion.

You “won” not because you could pick the \\nprettiest contestant, but because you could pick the contestant that everyone else would \\npick as the prettiest contestant. In other words, the stock market is a popularity contest, \\nbut the “best” stock was not necessarily the most popular. \\nKeynes described investing in the stock market as follows: \\n“The smart player recognizes that personal criteria of beauty are irrelevant in \\ndetermining the contest winner. A better strategy is to select those faces the other \\nplayers are likely to fancy. This logic tends to snowball. After all, the other participants \\nare likely to play the game with at least as keen a perception. Thus, the optimal strategy \\nis not to pick those faces the player thinks are prettiest, or those the other players are \\nlikely to fancy, but rather to predict what the average opinion is likely to be about what \\nthe average opinion will be.”[2]  \\nIn the stock market, the forces of supply and demand determine stock prices. The more \\ndemand or popularity there is for a company’s stock, the higher its price will go (unless \\nthe company issues more shares). A stock is popular, and thus in greater demand, if it is \\nthought to be more valuable— that is, if it has more earnings and growth potential. \\nSometimes a company is under- or overpriced relative to the going price for similar \\ncompanies. If the market recognizes the “error,” the stock price should rise or fall as it \\n“corrects” itself. \\nA growth stock is a stock that promises a higher rate of return because the market has \\nunderestimated its growth potential. A value is a stock that has been underpriced for \\nsome other reason.

Explain the significance of market value ratios. \\nA corporation creates a return for investors by creating earnings. Those earnings may be \\npaid out in cash as a dividend or retained as capital by the company. A company’s ability \\nto create earnings is watched closely by investors because the company’s earnings are \\nthe investor’s return. \\nA company’s earnings potential can be tracked and measured, and several \\nmeasurements are expressed as ratios. Mathematically, as discussed in Chapter 3 \\n\"Financial Statements\", a ratio is simply a fraction. In investment analysis, a ratio \\nprovides a clear means of comparing values. Three kinds of ratios important to investors \\nare return ratios, growth ratios, and market value ratios. \\nThe ratios described here are commonly presented in news outlets and Web sites where \\nstocks are discussed (e.g., http://www.nasdaq.com), so chances are you won’t have to \\ncalculate them yourself. Nevertheless, it is important to understand what they mean and \\nhow to use them in your investment thinking. \\nReturn Ratios \\nOne of the most useful ratios in looking at stocks is the earnings per share (EPS)The \\ndollar value of the earnings per each share of common stock. ratio. It calculates the \\ncompany’s earnings, the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding \\nshare of common stock. The calculation lets you see how much you benefit from holding \\neach share. Here is the formula for calculating EPS: \\nEPS = (net income − preferred stock dividends) ÷ average number of common shares \\noutstanding  \\nThe company’s earnings are reported on its income statement as net income, so a \\nshareholder could easily track earnings growth. However, EPS allows you to make a '),\n",

Earnings per share should be compared over time and also \\ncompared to the EPS of other companies. \\nWhen a stock pays a dividend, that dividend is income for the shareholder. Investors \\nconcerned with the cash flows provided by an equity investment look at \\ndividends per share or DPS as a measure of the company’s ability and willingness to \\npay a dividend. \\nDPS = common stock dividends ÷ average number of common shares outstanding  \\nAnother measure of the stock’s usefulness in providing dividends is the \\ndividend yield, which calculates the dividend as a percentage of the stock price. It is a \\nmeasure of the dividend’s role as a return on investment: for every dollar invested in the \\nstock, how much is returned as a dividend, or actual cash payback? An investor \\nconcerned about cash flow returns can compare companies’ dividend yields. \\ndividend yield = dividend per share (in dollars) ÷ price per share (in dollars)  \\nFor example, Microsoft, Inc., has a share price of around $24, pays an annual dividend \\nof $4.68 billion, and has about nine billion shares outstanding; for the past year, it \\nshows earnings of $15.3 billion.[1]  \\nAssuming it has not issued preferred stock and so pays no preferred stock dividends, \\nEPS = 15.3 billion/9 billion = $1.70 DPS = 4.68 billion/9 billion = $0.52 dividend yield \\n= 0.52/24 = 2.1667%  \\nMicrosoft earned $15.3 billion, or $1.70 for each share of stock held by stockholders, \\nfrom which $0.52 is actually paid out to shareholders. So if you buy a share of Microsoft \\nby investing $24, the cash return provided to you by the company’s dividend is 2.1667 \\npercent. \\nEarnings are either paid out as dividends or are retained by the company as capital. That \\ncapital is used by the company to finance operations, capital investments such as new \\nassets for expansion and growth or repayment of debt. \\nThe dividend is the return on investment that comes as cash while you own the stock. \\nSome investors see the dividend as a more valuable form of return than the earnings \\nthat are retained as capital by the company. It is more liquid, since it comes in cash and \\ncomes sooner than the gain that may be realized when the stock is sold (more valuable \\nbecause time affects value). It is the “bird in the hand,” perhaps less risky than waiting \\nfor the eventual gain from the company’s retained earnings. \\nSome investors see a high dividend as a sign of the company’s strength, indicative of its \\nability to raise ample capital through earnings. Dividends are a sign that the company \\ncan earn more capital than it needs to finance operations, make capital investments, or '),\n",

Thus, dividends are capital that can be spared from use by the company and \\ngiven back to investors. \\nOther investors see a high dividend as a sign of weakness, indicative of a company that \\ncannot grow because it is not putting enough capital into expansion and growth or into \\nsatisfying creditors. This may be because it is a mature company operating in saturated \\nmarkets, a company stifled by competition, or a company without the creative resources \\nto explore new ventures. \\nAs an investor, you need to look at dividends in the context of the company and your \\nown income needs. \\nGrowth Ratios \\nThe more earnings are paid out to shareholders as dividends, the less earnings are \\nretained by the company as capital. \\nearnings = dividends + capital retained  \\nSince retained capital finances growth, the more earnings are used to pay dividends, the \\nless earnings are used to create growth. Two ratios that measure a company’s choice in \\nhandling its earnings are the dividend payout rate and the retention rate. The \\ndividend payout rate compares dividends to earnings. The retention rate \\ncompares the amount of capital retained to earnings. \\nThe dividend payout rate figures the dividend as a percentage of earnings. \\ndividend payout rate = dividends ÷ earnings  \\nThe retention rate figures the retained capital as a percentage of earnings. \\nretention rate = capital retained ÷ earnings  \\nBecause earnings = dividends + capital retained, then \\n100% of earnings = dividend payout + retention rate.  \\nIf a company’s dividend payout rate is 40 percent, then its retention rate is 60 percent; if \\nit pays out 40 percent of its earnings in dividends, then it retains 60 percent of them. \\nSince Microsoft has earnings of $15.3 billion and dividends of $4.68 billion, it must \\nretain $10.62 billion of its earnings. So, for Microsoft, \\ndividend payout rate = 4.68 billion/15.3 billion = 30.59% retention rate = 10.62 \\nbillion/15.3 billion = 69.41%.  '),\n",

These \\nnumbers are useful, however, to get a sense of the company’s strategy and to compare it \\nto competitors. \\nA company’s value is in its ability to grow and to increase earnings. The rate at which it \\ncan retain capital, earn it and not pay it out as dividends, is a factor in determining how \\nfast it can grow. This rate is measured by the internal growth rate and the \\nsustainable growth rate. The internal growth rate answers the question, “How fast could \\nthe company grow (increase earnings) without any new capital, without borrowing or \\nissuing more stock?” Given how good the company is at taking capital and turning it \\ninto assets and using those assets to create earnings, the internal growth rate looks at \\nhow fast the company can grow without any new borrowing or new shares issued. \\nThe sustainable growth rate answers the question, “How fast could the company \\ngrow without changing the balance between using debt and using equity for capital?” \\nGiven how good the company is at taking capital and turning it into assets and using \\nthose assets to create earnings, the sustainable growth rate looks at how fast the \\ncompany can grow if it uses some new borrowing, but keeps the balance between debt \\nand equity capital stable. \\nBoth growth rates use the retention rate as a factor in allowing growth. The fastest rate \\nof growth could be achieved by having a 100 percent retention rate, that is, by paying no \\ndividends and retaining all earnings as capital. \\nAn investor who is not using stocks as a source of income but for their potential gain \\nmay look for higher growth rates (evidenced by a higher retention rate and a lower \\ndividend payout rate). An investor looking for income from stocks would instead be \\nattracted to companies offering a higher dividend payout rate and a lower retention rate \\n(despite lower growth rates). \\nMarket Value Ratios \\nWhile return and growth ratios are measures of a company’s fundamental value, and \\ntherefore the value of its stocks, the actual stock price is affected by the market. \\nInvestors’ demand can result in underpricing or overpricing of a stock, depending on its \\nattractiveness in relation to other investment choices or opportunity cost. \\nA stock’s market value can be compared with that of other stocks. The most common \\nmeasure for doing so is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E. Price-to-earnings ratio is \\ncalculated by dividing the price per share (in dollars) by the earnings per share (in \\ndollars). The result shows the investment needed for every dollar of return that the stock \\ncreates. \\nP/E = price per share ÷ earnings per share  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 376}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  377 \\nFor Microsoft, for example, the price per share is around $24, and the EPS is $1.70, so \\nthe P/E = 24.00/1.70 = $14.12. This means that the price per share is around fourteen \\ntimes bigger than the earnings per share. \\nThe larger the P/E ratio, the more expensive the stock is and the more you have to invest \\nto get one dollar’s worth of earnings in return. To get $1.00 of Microsoft’s earnings, you \\nhave to invest around $14. By comparing the P/E ratio of different companies, you can \\nsee how expensive they are relative to each other. \\nA low P/E ratio could be a sign of weakness. Perhaps the company has problems that \\nmake it riskier going forward, even if it has earnings now, so the future expectations and \\nthus the price of the stock is now low. Or it could be a sign of a buying opportunity for a \\nstock that is currently underpriced. \\nA high P/E ratio could be a sign of a company with great prospects for growth and so a \\nhigher price than would be indicted by its earnings alone. On the other hand, a high P/E \\ncould indicate a stock that is overpriced and has nowhere to go but down. In that case, a \\nhigh P/E ratio would be a signal to sell your stock. \\nHow do you know if the P/E ratio is “high” or “low”? You can compare it to other \\ncompanies in the same industry or to the average P/E ratio for a stock index of similar \\ntype companies based on company size, age, debt levels, and so on. As with any of the \\nratios discussed here, this one is useful in comparison. \\nAnother indicator of market value is the price-to-book ratio (P/B). Price-to-book \\nratio compares the price per share to the book value of each share. The book value is \\nthe value of the company that is reported “on the books,” or the company’s balance \\nsheet, using the intrinsic or original values of assets, liabilities, and equity. The balance \\nsheet does not show the market value of the company’s assets, for example, not what \\nthey could be sold for today; it shows what they were worth when the company acquired \\nthem. The book value of a company should be less than its market value, which should \\nhave appreciated over time. The company should be worth more as times goes on. \\nP/B = price per share ÷ book value of equity per share  \\nSince the price per share is the market value of equity per share, the P/B ratio compares \\nthe current market value of the company’s equity to its book value. If that ratio is greater \\nthan one, then the company’s equity is worth more than its original value, and the \\ncompany has been increasing its value. If that ratio is less than one, then the company’s \\ncurrent value is less than its original value, so the value has been decreasing. A P/B of \\none would indicate that a company has just been breaking even in terms of value over \\nthe years. \\nThe higher the P/B ratio, the better the company has done in increasing its value over \\ntime. You can calculate the ratio for different companies and compare them by their \\nability to increase value. '),\n",

That is easier said than done, however, and requires that you have the \\nknowledge, skill, and data for stock analysis. Commonly used general stock strategies \\nmay be long term (returns achieved in more than one year) or short term (returns \\nachieved in less than one year), but the strategies you choose should fit your investing \\nhorizon, risk tolerance, and needs. An important part of that strategy, as with financial \\nplanning in general, is to check your stock investments and reevaluate your holdings \\nregularly. How regularly depends on to long- or short-term horizon of your investing \\nstrategies. \\nLong-Term Strategies \\nLong-term strategies favor choosing a long-term approach to avoid the volatility and \\nrisk of market timing. For individual investors, a buy-and-hold strategy  can be \\neffective over the long run. The strategy is just what it sounds like: you choose the stocks \\nfor your equity investments, and you hold them for the long term. The idea is that if you \\nchoose wisely and your stocks are well diversified, over time you will do at least as well \\nas the stock market itself. Though it suffers through economic cycles, the economy’s \\nlong-term trend is growth. \\nBy minimizing the number of transactions, you can minimize transaction costs. Since \\nyou are holding your stocks, you are not realizing gains and are not paying gains tax. \\nThus, even if your gross returns are not spectacular, you are minimizing your costs and \\nmaximizing net returns. This strategy is optimal for investors with a long horizon, low \\nrisk tolerance, and little need for liquidity in the short term. \\nAnother long-term strategy is dollar-cost averaging.The idea of dollar-cost averaging \\nis that you invest in a stock gradually by buying the same dollar amount of the same \\nstock at regular intervals. This is a way of negating the effects of market timing. By \\nbuying at regular intervals, you will buy at times when the price is low and when it is \\nhigh, but over time your price will average out. Dollar-cost averaging is a way of \\navoiding a stock’s price volatility because the net effect is that you buy the stock at its \\naverage price. \\nAn investor uses dollar-cost averaging when regular payroll deductions are made to \\nfund defined contribution retirement plans, such as a 401(k) or a 403b. The same \\namount is contributed to the plan in regular intervals and is typically used to purchase \\nthe same set of specified assets. \\nA buy-and-hold or dollar-cost averaging strategy only makes sense over time because \\nboth assume a long time horizon in order to “average out” volatility, making them better \\nthan other investment choices. If you have a long-term horizon, as with a retirement \\nplan, those strategies can be quite effective. However, as the most recent decade has \\nshown, market or economic cycles can be long too, so you need to think about whether '),\n",

This allows you to avoid brokerage \\ncommissions. Direct investment means purchasing shares from the company, while \\ndividend reinvestment means having your dividends automatically invested in more \\nshares (rather than being sent to you as cash). Dividend reinvestment is also a way of \\nbuilding up your equity in the stock by reinvesting cash that you might otherwise spend. \\nThe advantage of direct investment and dividend reinvestment is primarily the savings \\non brokers’ commissions. You can also buy fractional shares or less than a whole share, \\nand there is no minimum amount to invest, as there can be with brokerage transactions. \\nThe disadvantage is that by having funds automatically reinvested, you are not actively \\ndeciding how they should be invested and thus may be missing better opportunities. \\nIndexing is a passive long-term investment strategy to invest in index funds as a \\ndiversified asset rather than select stocks. Instead of choosing individual large cap \\ncompanies, for example, you could invest in Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index fund, \\nwhich would provide more diversification for only one transaction cost than you could \\nget picking individual securities. The disadvantage to indexing is that you do not enjoy \\nthe potential of individual stocks producing above-average returns. \\nFigure 15.7 \"Long-Term Stock Strategies\" summarizes long-term stock strategies. \\nFigure 15.7 Long-Term Stock Strategies \\n \\nShort-Term Strategies \\nShort-term stock strategies rely on taking advantage of market timing to earn above-\\naverage returns.

It also relies on correctly identifying growth and value stocks and \\nmarket trends in their favor, complicating the process of market timing even further. \\nDay trading is a very short-term strategy of taking and closing a position in a day or \\ntwo.

Venice issued \\nthe first known government bonds of the modern era in 1157,[1]  \\nwhile private bonds are cited in British records going back to the thirteenth century.[2]  \\nVenice issued bonds to raise funds to finance a Crusade against Constantinople, which \\nincluded expansion of a shipyard attached to the Venetian Arsenal. (Go to \\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Arsenal to view images.) \\n  \\nBonds \\nIn addition to financing government projects, bonds are used by corporations to \\ncapitalize growth. Bonds are also a legal arrangement, couched in conditions, \\nobligations, and consequences. As a result of their legal and financial roles, bonds carry \\na quaint and particular vocabulary. Bonds come in all shapes and sizes to suit the needs \\nof the borrowers and the demands of lenders. Figure 16.1 \"Basic Bond Features\" lists the \\ndescriptive terms for basic bond features. \\nFigure 16.1 Basic Bond Features '),\n",

It is calculated as a percentage \\nof the face value— amount borrowed— so that the annual coupon = coupon rate × face \\nvalue. By convention, each individual bond has a face value of $1,000. A corporation \\nissuing a bond to raise $100 million would have to issue 100,000 individual bonds \\n(100,000,000 divided by 1,000). If those bonds pay a 4 percent coupon, a bondholder \\nwho owns one of those bonds would receive a coupon of $40 per year (1,000 × 4%), or \\n$20 every six months. \\nThe coupon rate of interest on the bond may be fixed or floating and may change. A \\nfloating rate is usually based on another interest benchmark, such as the U.S. \\nprime rate, a widely recognized benchmark of prevailing interest rates. \\nA zero-coupon bond has a coupon rate of zero: it pays no interest and repays only the \\nprincipal at maturity. A “zero” may be attractive to investors, however, because it can be \\npurchased for much less than its face value. There are deferred coupon bonds (also \\ncalled split-coupon bonds and issued below par), which pay no interest for a specified \\nperiod, followed by higher-than-normal interest payments until maturity. There are also \\nstep-up bonds that have coupons that increase over time. \\nThe face value, the principal amount borrowed, is paid back at maturity. If the bond is \\ncallable, it may be redeemed after a specified date but before maturity. A borrower \\ntypically “calls” its bonds after prevailing interest rates have fallen, making lower-cost \\ndebt available. Borrowers can borrow new, cheaper debt and pay off the older, more \\nexpensive debt. As an investor (lender), you would be paid back early, which sounds \\ngreat, but because interest rates have fallen, you would have trouble finding another \\nbond investment that would pay as high a rate of return. \\n'),\n",

If a bond were converted into stock, the \\nbondholder would become a shareholder, assuming more of the company’s risk. \\nThe bond may be secured by collateral, such as property or equipment, sometimes called \\na mortgage bond. If unsecured, or secured only by the “full faith and credit” of the \\nborrower (the borrower’s unconditional commitment to pay principal and interest on \\nthe debt), the bond is a debenture. Most bonds are issued as debentures. \\nA bond specifies if the borrower has more than one bond issue outstanding or more than \\none set of lenders to repay, which establishes the bond’s seniority in relation to \\npreviously issued debt. This “pecking order” determines which lenders will be paid back \\nfirst in case of default on the debt or bankruptcy. Thus, when the borrower does not \\nmeet its coupon obligations, investors holding senior debt as opposed to \\nsubordinated debt have less risk of default. \\nBonds may also come with covenants or conditions on the borrower. Covenants are \\nusually attached to corporate bonds and require the company to maintain certain \\nperformance goals during the term of the loan. Those goals are designed to lower \\ndefault risk for the lender. Examples of typical covenants are \\n• dividend limits, \\n• debt limits, \\n• limits on sales of assets, \\n• maintenance of certain liquidity ratios or minimum cash balances. \\nCorporations issue corporate bonds, usually with maturities of ten, twenty, or thirty \\nyears. Corporate bonds tend to be the most “customized,” with features such as \\ncallability, conversion, and covenants. \\nThe U.S. government issues Treasury bills for short-term borrowing, \\nTreasury notes for intermediate-term borrowing (longer than one year but less than \\nten years), and Treasury bonds for long-term borrowing for more than ten years. The \\nfederal government also issues Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). \\nTIPS pay a fixed coupon, but the principal adjusts with inflation. At maturity, you are \\nrepaid either the original principal or the inflation-adjusted principal, whichever is \\ngreater. \\nState and municipal governments issue revenue bonds or general obligation bonds. A \\nrevenue bond is repaid out of the revenue generated by the project that the debt is \\nfinancing. For example, toll revenue may secure a debt that finances a highway. A \\ngeneral obligation bond is backed by the state or municipal government, just as a \\ncorporate debenture is backed by the corporation. \\nInterest from state and municipal bonds (also called “munis”) may not be subject to \\nfederal income taxes. Also, if you live in that state or municipality, the interest may not \\nbe subject to state and local taxes. The tax exemption differs from bond to bond, so you '),\n",

Even if the interest is not taxable, however, \\nany gain (or loss) from the sale of the bond is taxed, so you should not think of munis as \\n“tax-free” bonds. \\nForeign corporations and governments issue bonds. You should keep in mind, however, \\nthat foreign government defaults are not uncommon. Mexico in 1994, Russia in 1998, \\nand Argentina in 2001 are all recent examples. Foreign corporate or sovereign debt also \\nexposes the bondholder to currency risk, as coupons and principal will be paid in the \\nforeign currency.

Even small towns issue bonds to \\nfinance capital expenditures such as schools, fire stations, and roads. Each kind of bond \\nhas its own market. \\nPrivate placement refers to bonds that are issued in a private sale rather than \\nthrough the public markets. The investors in privately placed bonds are institutional \\ninvestors such as insurance companies, endowments, and pension funds. \\nU.S. Treasury bonds are issued to the primary market through auctions. Participants, \\nusually dealers or institutional investors, bid for the bonds, but no one participant is \\nallowed to buy enough shares to monopolize the secondary market.

Because the details of each bond issue may vary— maturity, coupon rate, \\ncallability, convertibility, covenants, and so on— it is hard to directly compare bond \\nvalues the way stock values are compared. As a result, the corporate bond markets are \\nless transparent to the individual investor. \\nTo provide guidance, rating agencies provide bond ratings; that is, they “grade” \\nindividual bond issues based on the likelihood of default and thus the risk to the \\ninvestor. Rating agencies are independent agents that base their ratings on the financial \\nstability of the company, its business strategy, competitive environment, outlook for the \\nindustry and the economy— any factors that may affect the company’s ability to meet \\ncoupon obligations and pay back debt at maturity. \\nRatings agencies such as Fitch Ratings, A. M. Best, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s \\n(S&P) are hired by large borrowers to analyze the company and rate its debt. Moody’s \\nalso rates government debt.

Because they are \\nriskier, speculative grade bonds need to offer investors a higher return or yield in order \\nto be “priced to sell.” \\nAlthough the term “junk bonds” sounds derogatory, not all speculative grade bonds are \\n“worthless” or are issued by “bad” companies. Bonds may receive a speculative rating if \\ntheir issuers are young companies, in a highly competitive market, or capital intensive, \\nrequiring lots of operating capital. Any of those features would make it harder for a \\ncompany to meet its bond obligations and thus may consign its bonds to a speculative \\nrating. In the 1980s, for example, companies such as CNN and MCI Communications \\nCorporation issued high-yield bonds, which became lucrative investments as the \\ncompanies grew into successful corporations. \\nDefault risk is the risk that a company won’t have enough cash to meet its interest \\npayments and principal payment at maturity. That risk depends, in turn, on the \\ncompany’s ability to generate cash, profit, and grow to remain competitive. Bond-rating \\nagencies analyze an issuer’s default risk by studying its economic, industry, and firm-\\nspecific environments and estimate its current and future ability to satisfy its debts. The \\ndefault risk analysis is similar to equity analysis, but bondholders are more concerned \\nwith cash flows— cash to pay back the bondholders— and profits rather than profits \\nalone. \\nBond ratings can determine the coupon rate the issuer must offer investors to \\ncompensate them for default risk. The higher the risk, the higher the coupon must be. \\nRatings agencies have been criticized recently for not being objective enough in their \\nratings of the corporations that hire them. Nevertheless, over the years bond ratings \\nhave proven to be a reliable guide for bond investors. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Bond features that can determine risk and return include \\no coupon and coupon structure, \\no maturity, callablility, and convertibility, \\no security or debenture, \\no seniority or subordination, \\no covenants. \\n• The U.S. government issues Treasury \\no bills for short-term borrowing, \\no notes for intermediate-term borrowing, \\no bonds for long-term borrowing, '),\n",

To understand bond values, \\nthen, is to understand the value of its return and the costs of its risks. \\nBonds return two cash flows to their investors: (1) the coupon, or the interest paid at \\nregular intervals, usually twice yearly or yearly, and (2) the repayment of the principal at \\nmaturity. The amounts are spelled out in the bond itself. The coupon rate is specified \\n(for a fixed-rate bond) and the face value is the principal to be returned at the stated \\nmaturity. '),\n",

Any \\nbond feature that makes those cash flows less certain increases the risk to the investor \\nand thus the investor’s return. If the bond has a floating-rate coupon, for example, then \\nthere is uncertainty about the amount of the coupon payments. If the bond is callable, \\nthere is uncertainty about the number of coupon payments. \\nWhatever the particular features of a bond, as debt instruments, bonds expose investors \\nto specific risks. What are those risks, and what is their role is defining expectations of \\nreturns? \\nBond Returns \\nUnlike a stock, a bond’s future cash returns are known with certainty. You know what \\nthe coupon will be (for a fixed-rate bond) and you know that at maturity the bond will \\nreturn its face value. For example, if a bond pays a 4 percent coupon and matures in \\n2020, you know that every year your will receive $20 twice per year (20 = 4% × 1,000 × \\n½) until 2020 when you will also receive the $1,000 face value at maturity. You know \\nwhat you will get and when you will get it. However, you can’t be sure what that will be \\nworth to you when you do. You don’t know what your opportunity cost will be at the \\ntime. \\nInvestment returns are quoted as an annual percentage of the amount invested, the rate \\nof return. For a bond, that rate is the yield. Yield is expressed in two ways: the current \\nyield and the yield to maturity. The current yield is a measure of your bond’s rate of \\nreturn in the short term, if you buy the bond today and keep it for one year. You can \\ncalculate the current yield by looking at the coupon for the year as a percentage of your \\ninvestment or the current price, which is the market price of the bond. \\ncurrent yield = annual coupon (interest received, or cash flows) ÷ market value = \\n(coupon rate × face value) ÷ market value.  \\nSo, if you bought a 4 percent coupon bond, which is selling for $960 today (its market \\nvalue), and kept it for one year, the current yield would be 40 (annual coupon) ÷ 960 \\n(market value) = 4.1667%. The idea of the current yield is to give you a quick look at \\nyour immediate returns (your return for the next year). \\nIn contrast, the yield to maturity (YTM) is a measure of your return if you bought the \\nbond and held it until maturity, waiting to claim the face value. That calculation is a bit \\nmore complicated, because it involves the relationship between time and value (Chapter \\n4 \"Evaluating Choices: Time, Risk, and Value\"), since the yield is over the long term \\nuntil the bond matures. You will find bond yield-to-maturity calculators online, and \\nmany financial calculators have the formulas preprogrammed. \\nTo continue the example, if you buy a bond for $960 today (2010), you will get $20 \\nevery six months until 2020, when you will also get $1,000. Because you are buying the '),\n",

Over the time until maturity, the \\nbond returns coupons plus a gain. Its yield to maturity is close to 4.5 percent. \\nBond prices, their market values, have an inverse relationship to the yield to maturity. \\nAs the price goes down, the yield goes up, and as the price goes up, the yield goes down. \\nThis makes sense because the payout at maturity is fixed as the face value of the bond \\n($1,000). Thus, the only way a bond can have a higher rate of return is to have a lower \\nprice in the first place. \\nThe yield to maturity is directly related to interest rates in general, so as interest rates \\nincrease, bond yields increase, and bond prices fall. As interest rates fall, bond yields \\nfall, and bond prices increase. Figure 16.4 \"Bond Prices, Bond Yields, and Interest \\nRates\" shows these relationships. \\nFigure 16.4 Bond Prices, Bond Yields, and Interest Rates \\n \\nYou can use the yield to maturity to compare bonds to see how good they are at creating \\nreturns. This yield holds if you hold the bond until maturity, but you may sell the bond \\nat any time. When you sell the bond before maturity, you may have a gain or a loss, since \\nthe market value of the bond may have increased or decreased since you bought it. That \\ngain or loss would be part of your return along with the coupons you have received over \\nthe holding period, the period of time that you held the bond. \\nYour holding period yield is the annualized rate of return that you receive depending \\non how long you have held the bond, its gain or loss in market value, and the coupons \\nyou received in that period. For example, if you bought the bond for $960 and sold it \\nagain for $980 after two years, your return in dollars would be the coupons of $80 ($40 \\nper year × 2 years) plus your gain of $20 ($980 − 960), relative to your original \\ninvestment of $960. Your holding period yield would be close to 5.2 percent. \\n'),\n",

The risk that the company will be unable \\nto make its payments is default risk— the risk that it will default on the bond. You can \\nestimate default risk by looking at the bond rating as well as the economic, sector, and \\nfirm-specific factors that define the company’s soundness. \\nPart of a bond’s value is that you can expect regular coupon payments in cash. You could \\nspend the money or reinvest it. There is a risk, however, that when you go to reinvest the \\ncoupon, you will not find another investment opportunity that will pay as high a return \\nbecause interest rates and yields have fallen. This is called reinvestment risk. Your \\ncoupons are the amount you thought they would be, but they are not worth as much as \\nyou expected, because you cannot earn as much from them. \\nIf interest rates and bond yields have dropped, your fixed-rate bond, which is still \\npaying the now-higher-than-other-bonds coupon, has become more valuable. Its market \\nprice has risen. But the only way to realize the gain from the higher price is to sell the \\nbond, and then you won’t have any place to invest the proceeds in other bonds to earn as \\nmuch return. \\nReinvestment risk is one facet of interest rate risk, which arises from the fundamental \\nrelationship between bond values and interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that \\na change in prevailing interest rates will change bond value— that interest rates will rise \\nand the market value of the bond will fall. (If interest rates fell, the bond value would \\nincrease, which the investor would not see as a risk.) \\nAnother threat to the value of your coupons and principal repayment is inflation. \\nInflation risk is the risk that your coupons and principal repayment will not be worth \\nas much as you thought, because inflation has decreased the purchasing power or the \\nvalue of the dollars you receive. \\nA bond’s features can make it more or less vulnerable to these risks. In general, the \\nlonger the term to maturity is, the riskier the bond is. The longer the term is, the greater \\nthe probability that the bond will be affected by a change in interest rates, a period of \\ninflation, or a damaging business cycle. \\nIn general, the lower the coupon rate and the smaller the coupon, the more sensitive the \\nbond will be to a change in interest rates. The lower the coupon rate and the smaller the \\ncoupon, the more of the bond’s return comes from the repayment of principal, which \\nonly happens at maturity. More of your return is deferred until maturity, which also \\nmakes it more sensitive to interest rate risk. A bond with a larger coupon provides more \\nliquidity, over the term of the bond, and less exposure to risk. Figure 16.5 \"Bond \\nCharacteristics and Risks\" shows the relationship between bond characteristics and \\nrisks. '),\n",

Investors avoid \\nreinvestment risk since the only return— and reinvestment opportunity— comes when \\nthe principal is returned at maturity. However, a “zero” is exposed to the maximum \\ninterest rate risk, because interest rates will always be higher than its coupon rate of \\nzero. The attraction of a zero is that it can be bought for a very low price. \\nAs a bond investor, you can make better decisions if you understand how the \\ncharacteristics of bonds affect their risks and yields as you use those yields to compare \\nand choose bonds. \\nYield Curve \\nInterest rates affect bond risks and bond returns. If you plan to hold a bond until \\nmaturity, interest rates also affect reinvestment risk. If you plan to sell the bond before \\nmaturity, you face interest rate risk or the risk of a loss of market value. When you invest \\nin bonds, then, you want to be able to forecast future interest rates. \\nInvestors can get a sense of how interest rates are expected to change in the future by \\nstudying the yield curve. The yield curve is a graph of U.S. Treasury securities \\ncompared in terms of the yields for bonds of different maturities. U.S. Treasury \\nsecurities are used because the U.S. government is considered to have no default risk, so \\nthat the yields on its bills and bonds reflect only interest rate, reinvestment, and \\ninflation risks— all of which are reflected in expected, future interest rates. \\n'),\n",

Usually, the yield curve is upward sloping— that is, long-term rates \\nare higher than short-term rates. Long-term rates indicate expected future rates. If the \\neconomy is expanding, future interest rates are expected to be higher than current \\ninterest rates, because capital is expected to be more productive in the future. Future \\ninterest rates will also be higher if there is inflation because lenders will want more \\ninterest to make up for the fact that the currency has lost some of its purchasing power. \\nFigure 16.6 \"Upward-Sloping Yield Curve\" shows an upward-sloping yield curve. \\nFigure 16.6 Upward-Sloping Yield Curve[1]  \\n \\nDepending on economic forecasts, the yield curve can also be flat, as in Figure 16.7 \"Flat \\nYield Curve\", or downward sloping, as in Figure 16.8 \"Downward-Sloping Yield Curve\". \\nFigure 16.7 Flat Yield Curve[2]  \\n'),\n",

It is a widely used indicator \\nof interest rate trends, however. It can be useful to you to know the broad trends in \\ninterest rates that the market sees. \\nFor your bond investments, an upward-sloping yield curve indicates that interest rates \\nwill go up, which means that bond yields will go up but bond prices will go down. If you \\nare planning to sell your bond in that period of rising interest rates, you may be selling \\nyour bond at a loss. \\nBecause of their known coupon and face value, many investors use bonds to invest funds \\nfor a specific purpose. For example, suppose you have a child who is eight years old and \\nyou want her to be able to go to college in ten years. You might invest in bonds that have \\nten years until maturity. However, if you invest in bonds that have twenty years until \\nmaturity, they will have a higher yield (all else being equal), so you could invest less \\nnow. \\nYou could buy the twenty-year bonds but plan to sell them before maturity for a price \\ndetermined by what interest rates are in ten years (when you sell them). If the yield \\ncurve indicates that interest rates will rise over the next ten years, then you could expect \\nyour bond price to fall, and you would have a loss when you sell the bond, which would \\ntake away from your returns. \\nIn general, rising interest rates mean losses for bondholders who sell before maturity, \\nand falling interest rates mean gains for bondholders who sell before maturity.

When you include bonds in your portfolio, you do so to have \\nmore income and less risk than you would have with just stocks. Bonds also diversify the \\nportfolio. Because debt is so fundamentally different from equity, debt markets and \\nequity markets respond differently to changing economic conditions. \\nDiversification Strategies \\nIf your main strategic goal of including bonds is diversification, you can choose an active \\nor passive bond selection strategy. As with equities, an active strategy requires \\nindividual bond selection, while a passive strategy involves the use of indexing, or \\ninvesting through a broadly diversified bond index fund or mutual fund in which bonds \\nhave already been selected. \\nThe advantage of the passive strategy is its greater diversification and relatively low cost. \\nThe advantage of an active strategy is the chance to create gains by finding and taking \\nadvantage of market mispricings. An active strategy is difficult for individual investors \\nin bonds, however, because the bond market is less transparent and less liquid than the \\nstock market. \\nIf your main strategic goal of including bonds is to lower the risk of your portfolio, you \\nshould keep in mind that bond risk varies. U.S. Treasuries have the least default risk, \\nwhile U.S. and foreign corporate bonds have the most. Bond ratings can help you to \\ncompare default risks. \\nAnother way to look at the effect of default risk on bond prices is to look at spreads. A \\nspread is the difference between one rate and another. With bonds, the spread \\ngenerally refers to the difference between one yield to maturity and another. Spreads are \\nmeasured and quoted in basis points. A basis point is one one-hundredth of one \\npercent, or 0.0001 or 0.01 percent. \\nThe most commonly quoted spread is the difference between the yield to maturity for a \\nTreasury bond and a corporate bond with the same term to maturity. Treasury bonds \\nare considered to have no default risk because it is unlikely that the U.S. government \\nwill default. Treasuries are exposed to reinvestment, interest rate, and inflation risks, \\nhowever. \\nCorporate bonds are exposed to all four types of risk. So the difference between a \\ntwenty-year corporate bond and a twenty-year Treasury bond is the difference between \\na bond with and without default risk. The difference between their yields— the spread—\\nis the additional yield for the investor for taking on default risk. The riskier the \\ncorporate bond is, the greater the spread will be. \\nSpreads generally fluctuate with market trends and with confidence in the economy or \\nexpectations of economic cycles. When spreads narrow, the yields on corporate bonds \\nare closer to the yields on Treasuries, indicating that there is less concern with default '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 401}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  402 \\nrisk. When spreads widen— as they did in the summer and fall of 2008, when the debt \\nmarkets seemed suddenly very risky— corporate bondholders worry more about default \\nrisk. \\nAs the spread widens, corporate yields rise and/or Treasury yields fall. This means that \\ncorporate bond prices (market values) are falling and/or Treasury bond values are \\nrising. This is sometimes referred to as the “flight to quality.” In uncertain times, \\ninvestors would rather invest in Treasuries than corporate bonds, because of the \\nincreased default risk of corporate bonds. As a result, Treasury prices rise (and yields \\nfall) and corporate prices fall (and yields rise). \\nLonger-term bonds are more exposed to reinvestment, interest rate, and inflation risk \\nthan shorter-term bonds. If you are using bonds to achieve diversification, you want to \\nbe sure to be diversified among bond maturities. For example, you would want to have \\nsome bonds that are short-term (less than one year until maturity), intermediate-term \\n(two to ten years until maturity), and long-term (more than ten years until maturity) in \\naddition to diversifying on the basis of industries and company and perhaps even \\ncountries. \\nMatching Strategies \\nMatching strategies are used to create a bond portfolio that will finance specific \\nfunding needs, such as education, a down payment on a second home, or retirement. If \\nthe timing and cash flow amounts of these needs can be predicted, then a matching \\nstrategy can be used to support them. This strategy involves matching a “liability” (to \\nyourself, because you “owe” yourself the chance to reach that goal) with an asset, a bond \\ninvestment. The two most commonly used matching strategies are immunization and \\ncash flow matching. \\nImmunization is designing a bond portfolio that will achieve a certain rate of return \\nover a specific period of time, based on the idea of balancing interest rate risk and \\nreinvestment risk. \\nRecall that as interest rates rise, bond values decrease, but reinvested income from bond \\ncoupons earns more. As interest rates fall, bond values increase, but reinvested income \\nfrom bond coupons decreases. Immunization is the idea of choosing a portfolio of bonds \\nsuch that the exposure to interest rate risk is exactly offset by the exposure to \\nreinvestment risk for a certain period of time, thus guaranteeing a minimum return over \\nthat period.[1]  \\nIn other words, the interest rate risk and the reinvestment risk cancel each other out, \\nand the investor is left with a guaranteed return. You would use this kind of strategy \\nwhen you had a liquidity need with a deadline, for example, to fund a child’s higher \\neducation. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 402}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  403 \\nCash flow matching, also called a dedication strategy, is an alternative to \\nimmunization. It involves choosing bonds that match your anticipated cash flow needs \\nby having maturities that coincide with the timing of those needs. For example, if you \\nwill need $50,000 for travel in twenty years, you could buy bonds with a face value of \\n$50,000 and a maturity of twenty years. If you hold the bonds to maturity, their face \\nvalue provides the amount of cash flow you need, and you don’t have to worry about \\ninterest rate or reinvestment risk. You can plan on having $50,000 in twenty years, \\nbarring any default. \\nIf you had the $50,000 now, you could just stuff it under your mattress or save it in a \\nsavings account. But buying a bond has two advantages: (1) you may be able to buy the \\nbond for less than $50,000 now, requiring less upfront investment and (2) over the next \\ntwenty years, the bond will also pay coupons at a higher rate than you could earn with a \\nsavings account or under your mattress. \\nIf you will need different cash flows at different times, you can use cash flow matching \\nfor each one. When cash flow matching is used to create a steady stream of regular cash \\nflows, it is called bond laddering. You invest in bonds of different maturities, such \\nthat you would have one bond maturing and providing cash flow in each period (like the \\nCD laddering discussed in Chapter 7 \"Financial Management\"). \\nStrategies such as immunization and cash flow matching are designed to manage \\ninterest rate and reinvestment risk to minimize their effects on your portfolio’s goals. \\nSince you are pursuing an active strategy by selecting individual bonds, you must also \\nconsider transaction costs and the tax consequences of your gain (or loss) at maturity \\nand their effects on your target cash flows. \\nLife Cycle Investing \\nBonds most commonly are used to reduce portfolio risk. Typically, as your risk tolerance \\ndecreases with age, you will include more bonds in your portfolio, shifting its weight \\nfrom stocks— with more growth potential— to bonds, with more income and less risk. \\nThis change in the weighting of portfolio assets usually begins as you get closer to \\nretirement. \\nFor years, the conventional wisdom was that you should have the same percentage of \\nyour portfolio invested in bonds as your age, so that when you are thirty, you have 30 \\npercent of your portfolio in bonds; when you are fifty, you have 50 percent of your \\nportfolio in bonds, and so on. That wisdom is being questioned now, however, because \\nwhile bonds are lower risk, they also lower growth potential. Today, since more people \\ncan expect to live much longer past retirement age, they run a real risk of outliving their \\nfunds if they invest as conservatively as the conventional wisdom suggests. \\nIt is still true nevertheless that for most people, risk tolerance changes with age, and \\nyour investment in bonds should reflect that change.

Some funds are even designed to \\nperform the asset allocation task for the investor. Mutual funds are fast becoming the \\ndominant investment vehicle for individual investors, changing the role of the broker \\nand financial advisor. \\n17.1 Mutual Funds \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Identify the general purposes of using mutual funds in individual investment portfolios.  \\n2. Analyze the advantages of an index fund or a fund of funds. \\n3. List and define the structures of mutual funds. \\n4. Describe the strategic goals of lifestyle funds, leveraged funds, and inverse funds.  \\n5. Identify the costs and differences in costs of mutual fund investing.  \\n6. Calculate returns from mutual fund investing. \\n7. Summarize the information found in a mutual fund prospectus.  \\nAs defined in the Chapter 12 \"Investing\", a mutual fund is a portfolio of securities, \\nconsisting of one type of security or a combination of several different types. A fund \\nserves as a convenient way for an investor to have a diversified portfolio of investments \\nin just about any investable asset. The oldest mutual fund is believed to have been \\nfounded by Adriaan van Ketwich in 1774. Ketwich invited investors to contribute to a \\ntrust fund to spread the risk of investing in foreign bonds. The idea moved from the \\nNetherlands to Scotland to the United States, where the Boston Personal Property Trust \\nestablished the first mutual fund in 1893.[1]  \\nThe mutual fund’s popularity has grown in periods of economic expansion. At the height \\nof the stock market boom in 1929, there were over seven hundred mutual funds in the \\nUnited States. After 1934, mutual funds fell under the regulatory eye of the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (SEC), and it wasn’t until the 1950s that there were once \\nagain over one hundred mutual funds in the United States. \\nMutual funds multiplied in the 1970s, spurred on by the creation of IRAs and 401(k) \\nretirement plans, and again in the 1980s and 1990s, inspired by economic growth and \\nthe tech stock boom. By the end of 2008, U.S. mutual funds— which account for just \\nover half of the global market— had $9.6 trillion in assets under management. Forty-five \\npercent of all U.S. households owned mutual funds, compared to 6 percent in 1980. For \\n69 percent of those households, mutual funds were more than half of their financial \\nassets.[2]  \\nMutual funds play a significant role in individual investment decisions. '),\n",

By buying shares in the fund rather than individual securities, you achieve \\nextensive diversification for a much lower transaction cost than by investing in \\nindividual securities and making individual transactions. You also receive the benefit of \\nprofessional security selection, which theoretically minimizes the opportunity costs of \\nlesser choices. So by using a mutual fund, you get more and better security selection and \\ndiversification. \\nA mutual fund also provides stock and bond issuers with a mass market. Rather than \\nselling shares to investors individually (and incurring the costs of doing so), issuers can \\nmore easily find a market for their shares in mutual funds. \\nStructures and Types of Mutual Funds \\nLike stocks and bonds, mutual funds may be actively or passively managed. As you read \\nin Chapter 15 \"Owning Stocks\" and Chapter 16 \"Owning Bonds\", actively managed funds \\nprovide investors with professional management and the expected research, analysis, \\nand watchfulness that goes with it. Passively managed index funds, on the other hand, \\nare designed to mirror the performance of a specific index constructed to be \\nrepresentative of an asset class. Recall, for example, that the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) \\n500 Index is designed to mirror the performance of the five hundred largest large cap \\nstocks in the United States. \\nMutual funds are structured in three ways: \\n1. Closed-end funds \\n2. Open-end funds \\n3. Exchange-traded funds \\nClosed-end funds are funds for which a limited number of shares are issued. Once all \\nshares have been issued, the fund is “closed” so a new investor can only buy shares from \\nan existing investor. Since the shares are traded on an exchange, the limited supply of \\nshares and the demand for them in that market directly determines the value of the \\nshares for a closed-end fund. \\nMost mutual funds are open-end funds in which investors buy shares directly from \\nthe fund and redeem or sell shares back to the fund. The price of a share is its \\nnet asset value (NAV), or the market value of each share as determined by the fund’s \\nassets and liabilities and the number of shares that exist. Here is the basic formula for \\ncalculating NAV: \\nNAV = (market value of fund securities − fund liabilities) ÷ number of shares \\noutstanding.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 407}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  408 \\nDemand for shares is reflected in the number of shares outstanding, because the fund \\ncan create new shares for new investors. NAV calculations are usually done once per day \\nat the close of trading, when mutual fund transactions are recorded. \\nThe NAV is the price that the fund will pay you when you redeem your shares, so it is a \\ngauge of the shares’ value. It will increase if the market value of the securities in the fund \\nincreases faster than the number of new shares. \\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are structured like closed-end funds but are traded \\nlike stocks. Shares are traded and priced continuously throughout the day’s trading \\nsession, rather than once per day at the end of trading. ETFs trade more like individual \\nsecurities; that is, if you are trying to time a market, they are a more nimble asset to \\ntrade than open-end or closed-end funds. \\nOriginally designed as index funds, exchange-traded funds now target just about every \\nasset, sector, and economic region imaginable. Because of this, ETFs have become quite \\npopular, with over $529 billion invested in over seven hundred funds (as of April \\n2009).[3]  \\nFigure 17.2 \"Fund Features\" compares the features of closed-end funds, open-end funds, \\nand ETFs. \\nFigure 17.2 Fund Features \\n \\nShares of closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are bought and sold on \\nexchanges, much like shares of stock. You would go through a broker to make those \\ntransactions. Shares of open-end funds may be bought and sold directly from the fund \\nsponsor, a mutual fund company or investment manager such as Fidelity, Vanguard, \\nJanus, T. Rowe Price, or Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College \\nRetirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF). You can make those transactions at any of the \\ncompany’s offices, by telephone, or online. About 40 percent of all mutual fund \\ntransactions are done directly (without a broker) through a retirement plan contribution \\nor a mutual fund company.[4]  \\n'),\n",

Some research companies, such as Morningstar, track as many as forty-eight \\ndifferent categories of mutual funds. \\nTable 17.1 Other Types of Mutual Funds \\nFunds of funds  \\nMutual funds that own shares in other mutual funds rather than in \\nspecific securities. If you decide to use mutual funds rather than \\nselect securities, a fund of funds will provide expertise in choosing \\nfunds. \\nLifestyle funds \\nFunds of stocks and bonds that manage portfolio risk based on age \\nor the time horizon for liquidity needs.  \\n \\nLifestyle funds perform both security selection and asset allocation \\nfor investors, determined by the target date. For example, if you \\nwere now thirty years old, you might choose a lifestyle fund with a \\ntarget date of thirty-five years from now for your retirement \\nsavings. As the fund approaches its target date, its allocation of \\ninvestments in stocks and bonds will shift to carry less risk as the \\ntarget nears. Lifestyle funds are used primarily in saving for \\nretirement; many are created as funds of funds. \\nLeveraged funds \\n \\nFunds that invest both investors’ money and money that the fund \\nborrows to augment the investable assets and thus potential \\nreturns. Because they use borrowing, leveraged funds are riskier \\nthan funds that do not use leverage. \\nInverse funds                               \\n \\nFunds that aim to increase in value when the market declines, to be \\ncountercyclical to index funds, which aim to increase in value when \\nthe market rises. Inverse funds, also called bear funds, are set up to \\nperform contrary to the index. Since most economies become more \\nproductive over time, however, you can expect indexes to rise over \\ntime, so an inverse fund would make sense only as a very short-\\nterm investment. \\n  \\nMutual Fund Fees and Returns \\nAll funds must disclose their fees to potential investors: sales fees, management fees, \\nand expenses. A load fund charges a sales commission on each share purchase. That \\nsales charge (also called a front-end load) is a percentage of the purchase price. A no-\\nload fund, in contrast, does not charge a sales commission, because shares may be \\npurchased directly from the fund or through a discount broker. The front-end load can \\nbe as much as 8.5 percent, so if you plan to invest often or in large amounts, that can be \\na substantial charge. For example, a $5,000 investment may cost you $425, reducing \\nthe amount you have to invest and earn a return. '),\n",

The charge may be phased out if you own \\nthe shares for a specified length of time, however, usually five to seven years. \\nA fund may charge a management fee on an annual basis. The management fee is stated \\nas a fixed percentage of the fund’s asset value per share. Management fees can range \\nfrom 0.1 percent to 2.0 percent annually. Typically, a more actively managed fund can \\nbe expected to charge a higher management fee, while a passively managed fund such as \\nan index fund should charge a minimal management fee. \\nA fund may charge an annual 12b-1 fee or distribution fee, also calculated as not more \\nthan 1.0 percent per year of the fund’s asset value. Some mutual funds charge other \\nextra fees as well, passing on fund expenses to shareholders. You should consider fee \\nstructure and rate when choosing mutual funds, and this can be done through \\ncalculations of the expense ratio. \\nTaken together, the annual management, distribution, and expense fees are measured \\nby the expense ratio— the total annual fees expressed as a percentage of your total \\ninvestment. The expense ratio averages around 0.99 percent for all mutual funds, but it \\nmay be more than 2 percent of your investment’s value.[5]  \\nThat may not sound like much, but it means that if the fund earns a 5 percent return, \\nyour net return may be less than 3 percent (and after taxes, it’s even less). When \\nchoosing a fund, you should be aware of all charges— especially annual or ongoing \\ncharges— that can affect your investment return. \\nSay you invest in a load fund with a 5 percent front-end load and an expense ratio of \\n2.25 percent and suppose the fund earns a 5 percent return.

The returns of \\nthe fund are the returns of those assets: interest, dividends, or gains (losses). Income \\nmay come from interest distribution if the fund invests in bonds or interest-\\nproducing assets or as dividend distribution if the fund invests in stocks. \\nMutual funds buy and sell or “turn over” the fund assets. Even passively managed funds \\nneed to rebalance to keep pace with their benchmarks as market values change. The \\nturnover ratio is the percentage of fund assets that have been turned over or replaced \\nin the past year, a measure of the fund’s trading activity. \\nTurnover can create capital gains or losses. Periodically, usually once per year, the \\nfund’s net capital gains (or losses) are distributed on a per share basis as a \\ncapital gains distribution. You would expect turnover to produce more gains than \\nlosses. The more turnover, or the higher the turnover ratio, the greater the capital gains \\ndistributions you may expect. \\nUnless you have invested in a tax-exempt savings plan such as an Individual Retirement \\nAccount (IRA) or a 401(k), interest and dividend distributions are taxable as personal \\nincome, as are capital gains, including capital gains distributions. A higher turnover \\nratio may mean a higher tax expense for capital gains distributions. Most open-end \\nmutual funds allow you the option of having your income and gains distributions \\nautomatically reinvested rather than paid out, which means that you may be paying \\ntaxes on earnings without ever “seeing” the money. \\nMutual Fund Information and Strategies \\nAll mutual fund companies must offer a prospectus, a published statement detailing \\nthe fund’s assets, liabilities, management personnel, and performance record. You \\nshould always take the time to read it and to take a closer look at the fund’s investments \\nto make sure that the fund will be compatible and appropriate to your investment goals. \\nFor example, suppose you have an investment in an S&P 500 Index fund and now are \\nlooking for a global stock fund to complement and diversify your holdings in domestic \\n(U.S.) equities. You go to the Web site of a large mutual fund company offering \\nhundreds of funds. You find a stock fund called “Global Stock Fund”— sounds like it’s \\njust what you are looking for. Looking closer, however, you can see that this fund is \\ninvested in the stocks of companies in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. While \\nthey are not U.S. stocks, those economies are similar to the U.S. economy, perhaps too \\nsimilar to provide the diversity you are looking for. \\nOr suppose you are looking for a bond fund to create income and security. You find a \\nfund called the “Investment Grade Fixed Income Fund.” On closer inspection, however, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 411}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  412 \\nyou find that the fund does not invest only in investment grade bonds but that the \\naverage rating of its bonds is investment grade. This means that the fund invests in \\nmany investment grade bonds but also in some speculative grade bonds to achieve \\nhigher income. While this fund may suit your need for income, it may not be \\nappropriate for your risk tolerance. \\nMutual fund companies make this information readily available on Web sites and in \\nprospectuses. You should always make the extra effort to be sure you know what’s in \\nyour fund. In addition, mutual funds are widely followed by many performance analysts. \\nRatings agencies such as Morningstar and investment publications such as Barron’s and \\nForbes track, analyze, and report the performance of mutual funds. That information is \\navailable online or in print and provides comparisons of mutual funds that you may find \\nhelpful in choosing your fund. \\nIn print and online newspapers, mutual fund performance is reported daily in the form \\nof tables that compare the average returns of funds from week to week. Reported \\naverage returns are based on the net asset value per share (NAVPS). Investors can use \\nthis information to choose or compare funds and track the performance of funds they \\nown. \\nIn conclusion, since a mutual fund may be made up of any kind or many kinds of \\nsecurities (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities), it is not really another kind \\nof investment. Rather, it is a way to invest without specifically selecting securities, a way \\nof achieving a desired asset allocation without choosing individual assets. \\nThe advantages of investing in a mutual fund are the diversification available with \\nminimal transaction costs and the professional management or security selection that \\nyou buy when you buy into the fund. \\nCompared to actively managed funds, passively managed or index funds offer similar \\ndiversification but with lower management fees and expense ratios because you aren’t \\npaying for market timing or security selection skills. The turnover ratio shows how \\npassive or active the fund management is. About half of all equity mutual funds have a \\nturnover ratio of less than 50 percent.[6]  \\nPerformance history has shown that actively managed funds, on average, do not \\nnecessarily outperform passively managed funds.[7]  \\nSince they usually have higher fees, any advantage created by active management is \\nusually canceled out by their higher costs. Still, there are investors who believe that \\nsome mutual funds and mutual fund managers can, on average, outperform the markets \\nor the indexes that provide the benchmarks for passively managed funds. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Mutual funds provide investors with \\no diversification, '),\n",

Distinguish between direct and indirect investments in real estate.  \\n2. Identify the four main ways to invest in real estate indirectly. \\n3. Explain the role and the different kinds of REITs. \\n4. Discuss the role and uses of mortgage-backed securities. \\nWhen you buy a home, even with a mortgage, you are making a direct investment \\nbecause you are both the investor and the owner who holds legal title to the property. \\nFor most people, a home is the single largest investment they ever make. \\nAs an investor, you may want to include other real estate holdings in your portfolio, \\nmost likely as an indirect investment in which you invest in an entity that owns and \\nmanages real estate. Studies have shown that real estate is a good diversifier for \\nfinancial investments such as stocks and bonds.[1]  \\nDirect Investments \\nSonia is looking to buy her first home. After graduating from college, she decided to stay \\non because she liked the town and found a job as an elementary school teacher. She \\nloves her job, but her income is limited. She finds a nice, two-family house in a \\nneighborhood close to the college. It needs some work, but she figures she can use the \\nsummer months to fix it up— she’s pretty handy—and renting to students won’t be a \\nproblem. The tenants will pay their own utilities. Sonia figures that the rental income \\nwill help pay her mortgage, insurance, and taxes, and that after the mortgage is paid off, \\nit will provide a nice extra income. \\nMany real estate investors begin like Sonia, buying a rental property that helps them to \\nafford their own home. If you actively manage the rental property, there are tax benefits \\nas well. Of course, you have to provide maintenance services and arrange for repairs, \\nand, in Sonia’s case, perhaps give up a bit of privacy. A second or vacation home can be \\nused as a rental property as well, although the tax benefits are less assured. In both \\ncases, the investor is making a direct investment in the property. \\nThe advantages to a direct investment are the additional rental income and tax benefits. \\nThe disadvantages are that real estate is relatively illiquid, and the investment \\nconcentrates your portfolio in one asset class— residential real estate. Conventional \\nwisdom was that real estate was a good hedge against inflation, but the recent burst of \\nthe housing bubble— not only in the United States but also worldwide— has cast a '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 416}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  417 \\nshadow on that thinking. Also, to realize the tax benefits, you must actively manage the \\nrental property, and being a landlord is not for everyone. \\nOther direct real estate investments include commercial property, or property \\nexclusively for rent, and undeveloped land. Developers buy property or land and seek to \\nprofit from quickly improving and reselling it. Both are more speculative investments, \\nespecially if purchased with debt financing. They may also prove to be illiquid and to \\nconcentrate assets, making them inappropriate investments for investors without a large \\nand diversified portfolio. \\nIndirect Investments \\nInvestors who want to add a real estate investment to their portfolio more often make an \\nindirect investment. That is, they buy shares in an entity or group that owns and \\nmanages property. For example, they may become limited partners in a real estate \\nsyndicate. \\nA syndicate is a group created to buy and manage commercial property such as an \\napartment, office building, or shopping mall. The syndicate may be structured as a \\ncorporation or, more commonly, as a limited partnership. \\nIn a limited partnership, there is a general partner and limited partners. The general \\npartner manages the entity, while the limited partners invest in partnership shares. The \\nlimited partners are only liable for the amount of their investment; that is, they can lose \\nonly as much as they have put in. Limiting liability is particularly important in real \\nestate, which relies on leverage or debt financing. Investors find syndicates valuable in \\nlimiting liability and in providing management for the property. \\nAnother form of indirect investing is a real estate investment trust (REIT) — a \\nmutual fund of real estate holdings. You buy shares in the REIT, which may be privately \\nheld or publicly traded on an exchange. The REIT is a fund invested in various \\ncommercial properties. Some REITs specialize, concentrating investments in specific \\nkinds of property, such as shopping malls, apartments, or vacation properties. \\nTo qualify as a REIT in the United States (for the allowable tax benefits), a fund must \\n• be managed by directors as a corporation or trust, \\n• offer transferrable shares, \\n• not be a financial institution, \\n• have at least a hundred shareholders, \\n• have at least 95 percent of income from interest, dividends, and property, \\n• pay dividends that are at least 90 percent of the REITs taxable income, \\n• have at least 75 percent of its assets invested in real estate, \\n• get at least 75 percent of gross revenue from real estate.

A hybrid REIT does both. REITs do for real estate what mutual funds do for \\nother assets. They provide investors with a way to invest with more liquidity and \\ndiversity and with comparatively lower transaction costs. \\nAnother way to invest in the real estate market is to invest in the real estate financing \\nrather than the actual real estate. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are bonds \\nsecured by pools of mortgages owned by large financial institutions or agencies of the \\nfederal government. \\nIt is difficult to price mortgage-backed securities— to gauge their present and future \\nvalue and their risk. Like any bond, mortgage-backed securities are vulnerable to \\ninterest rate, reinvestment, and inflation risk, but they are also particularly vulnerable \\nto economic cycles and to default risk. If the economy is in a recession and \\nunemployment rises, mortgage defaults will likely rise. When mortgage defaults rise, \\nand the value of mortgage-backed securities falls. \\nBecause they are complicated and risky, mortgage-backed securities are appropriate \\nonly for investors with a large enough asset base and risk tolerance to support the \\ninvestment. MBS investors are usually institutional investors or very wealthy \\nindividuals. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Direct investments in real estate involve controlling ownership and management of the property.  \\n• Indirect investment involves owning a share of a company that owns and manages the real estate.  \\n• Indirect investments may be structured as \\no a syndicate, \\no a limited partnership, \\no a real estate investment trust (REIT). \\n• A REIT is designed as a mutual fund of real estate holdings.  \\no An equity REIT invests in property. \\no A mortgage REIT invests in real estate financing. \\no A hybrid REIT does both. \\n• Mortgage-backed securities are another way to invest in a real estate market by inves ting in its \\nfinancing, but they are considered too risky for individual investors.  \\nEXERCISES  '),\n",

Define and describe the characteristics and uses of derivative contracts.  \\n2. Explain the roles of precious metals in an investment portfolio.  \\n3. Describe the methods available to individual investors in making commodities investments.  \\n4. Compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using collectibles in an individual \\ninvestment portfolio. \\nSome investors prefer to invest directly in the materials that are critical to an industry or \\nmarket, rather than investing in the companies that use them. For example, if you think \\nthat the price of oil is going to rise, one way to profit from the higher price would be to \\nbuy shares of oil companies that profit by refining oil and selling gasoline, fuels, and \\nother petroleum products. Another way is to buy the oil itself as a commodity. \\nCommodities are raw materials— agricultural products, metals, energy sources, \\ncurrencies, and so on— that go into producing goods and services. Investing in \\ncommodities is a way to profit directly from the raw material rather than from its \\nproducts. As discussed in Chapter 12 \"Investing\", commodities trading is not new— the \\nfirst commodities exchange in the United States was established in 1848. \\nBecause they are or rely on natural resources, commodities have a largely unpredictable \\nsupply. They have inherent risk, because they are exposed to changes in weather or \\ngeology or global politics. Commodities trading began as a way for commodity \\nproducers and consumers to manage their risks. These traders are managing risks going \\nforward; that is, they hedge by buying and selling commodities that they expect to exist \\nin the future. This trading is done using future and forward contracts— types of \\nderivatives, discussed in the Chapter 12 \"Investing\". \\nInvesting in commodities involves transaction costs and a time limit on realizing your \\ngains (or losses), because derivatives are time-sensitive contracts created with an \\nexpiration date. \\nCommodity investing is risky business, because it is done through derivatives— assets \\nwhose value depends on the value of another asset. For instance, the value of a contract \\nto buy or sell soybeans at some time in the future depends on the value of the soybeans. \\nWhen you invest in a derivative, you are taking on the risk of both contract and the asset \\nthat it depends on. One strategy to manage this risk is to invest in both, creating a \\nsituation in which one investment can act as a hedge for the other. The way this works is \\nif the underlying asset (the soybeans) gains value, you’ll lose on the derivative (the \\nfutures contract on soybeans); but if the asset loses value, you can gain on the derivative. \\nOne example of this is the “prebuy” offer common in regions where homes are heated by \\noil. When you heat your home with oil, you are exposed to the risk of volatility in the \\nprice of oil. This volatility can upset your household budget and, since heat is a '),\n",

You could guarantee your \\nwinter’s cost of oil by buying it all in the summer, but you would need a huge oil tank to \\nstore all that oil until winter. As an alternative and to attract customers, some heating oil \\nsuppliers offer a prebuy deal. During the summer, customers can buy their winter’s \\nsupply of oil at a set price, and the oil company will then deliver it as needed over the \\nwinter months. \\nIf the price of oil goes up, the customer is protected and gains by not having to pay the \\nhigher price. The oil dealer loses the extra profit it could have had. On the other hand, if \\nthe price of oil goes down, the dealer is assured its profit, while the customer pays more \\nthan necessary without the prebuy deal. \\nIn the language of commodities trading, the customer is “short” oil, that is, needs it and \\nseeks to lock in a price through the prebuy deal. The oil dealer is “long” oil, that is, has a \\nsupply and wants to sell it and so seeks to lock in the sale of a certain quantity at a \\ncertain price. The customer wants to lock in a low price, while the dealer wants to lock in \\na high price. Each is betting on what will be “low” and “high” relative to what the real \\nprice of oil turns out to be in the future. The hedge of the prebuy deal relieves both the \\ncustomer and the dealer of the uncertainty or risk. The deal creates its own risks, but if \\nthose are smaller than the risk of oil’s price volatility, then the dealer will offer the \\nprebuy, and the customer will take it. \\nWhen you trade commodities, you are also exposed to the risks of trading in the \\ncommodities markets. Another reason that commodities investing is risky for individual \\ninvestors is because professional commodity investors often take speculative positions, \\nbetting on the future price of derivatives without holding investments in the underlying \\nassets. Speculators can influence that future price, which after all is just the market’s \\nconsensus of what that price “should” be. For individual investors, the risks of \\ncommodities trading often outweigh the advantage of whatever diversification they \\nbring to the portfolio. \\nGold, Silver, and Precious Metals \\nHistorically, gold and silver have been popular investments of individual investors. For \\nthousands of years, gold and silver have been used as a basis for currency value, either \\nminted into coins or used to back currency value. When a currency is backed by gold, for \\nexample, or is “on the gold standard,” there should be a direct relationship between the \\nvalue of the currency and the value of the gold. \\nIn times of inflation or deflation, investors worry that the value or purchasing power of \\ncurrency will change. They may invest in gold or silver as a more stable store of wealth \\nthan the currency that is supposed to represent the metal. In other words, if investors \\nlose faith in the currency that represents the gold, they may trade their money for the \\ngold. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 421}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  422 \\nMost currencies used today are not backed by a precious metal but by the productivity \\nand soundness of the economy that issues them. For example, the value of the U.S. \\ndollar is not related to the value of an ounce of gold, but to the value of the U.S. \\neconomy. \\nWhen economic or political turmoil seems to threaten the health of an economy and \\nhence the value of its currency, some investors choose to invest in the gold or silver that \\nseems to retain its value. For that reason, gold or silver has historically been regarded as \\na hedge against inflation. \\nHow exactly do you buy gold? Gold bullion is sold as bars or wafers in units of one \\nkilogram or 32.15 troy ounces. Metal dealers and some banks will sell bars or wafers \\nranging from 5 grams (or 0.16075 troy ounces) to 500 ounces or more. Transaction \\ncosts are relatively high, between 5 percent and 8 percent, and there is the cost of \\nstoring and securing the gold bars or wafers. \\nA more popular way to buy gold is as coins, which are more easily stored and secured. \\nGold coins are minted by several countries, including the United States, and may be \\nbought from banks, brokers, and dealers for a fee of about 2 percent. \\nCommodity Indexes and Exchange-Traded Funds \\nAs with stocks, bonds, and real estate, the most popular way for individual investors to \\ninvest in any commodities— including precious metals— is through open-end mutual \\nfunds or exchange-traded funds (ETF). The fund may invest in a variety of contracts, \\ndiversifying its holdings of the commodity. It has professional managers who \\nunderstand the pricing of such contracts and can research the market volatility and the \\nglobal economy. Using a fund as a way of investing in commodities thus provides both \\ndiversification and expertise. It can also give you more liquidity as fund shares can be \\nquickly traded into the market. \\nFor example, if you expect inflation and want to buy gold, instead of trying to buy gold \\nbars, you could invest in a fund (iShares), an exchange-traded fund (Comex Gold), or \\nmutual funds (Fidelity Select Gold or Vanguard Precious Metals). These funds allow you \\nto “own” gold but also to get diversification, expertise, and liquidity, reducing your risk. \\nThere are mutual funds or exchange-traded funds for nearly every commodity that is \\ntraded. There are also passively managed commodity index funds, similar to stock or \\nbond index funds. Investing in commodities can be a way to achieve asset diversification \\nin your portfolio, because often a commodity such as gold is countercyclical to the \\neconomy, and therefore is countercyclical to your stock and bond holdings as well. \\nCommodities may also add significant risk to a portfolio, however, so the advantage of \\nadding them as a diversification strategy may be canceled out by the additional risk. \\nCollectibles and Unique Investments '),\n",

So long as there is \\na market for it— a buyer— it potentially may be sold at a gain. \\nCollectibles and unique investments include the following: \\n• Antique furniture \\n• Stamps \\n• Coins \\n• Rare books \\n• Sports trading cards \\n• Vintage cars \\n• Vintage clothes \\n• Vintage wines \\n• Vintage vinyl \\n• Fine art \\n• Musical instruments \\n• Jewelry \\n• Historical curios \\n• Other ephemera \\nAs investments, collectibles cannot be standardized in the way that stocks, bonds, or \\neven real estate and used cars can be. Each asset has attributes that make it more or less \\nvaluable, even among similar assets. Its value is hard to judge, and therefore it is harder \\nfor buyer and seller to agree on a price. \\nProfessional appraisers are knowledgeable about both the item and the market and are \\ntrained to evaluate such assets. Theirs is a better-educated guess, but it is still just an \\nestimate of value. Individual investors also consult books on collectibles and may \\npurchase professional market research, pricing indexes, and auction records. \\nSometimes one person’s trash is another person’s treasure. It is fun to think that you \\nmay unearth a rare “find” at a garage sale or flea market or that some family heirloom \\nhas more than sentimental value. Usually, however, your ability to cash in on your luck \\nis limited by your ability to convince someone else of its worth and to sell when its \\nmarket is trendy. \\nCollectibles, including “ephemera” such as antique letters and photographs, are usually \\nsold by dealers or collectors or through a private sale arranged between buyer and seller. \\nThe dealers may establish a gallery to showcase items for sale. Auction houses such as \\nChristie’s or Sotheby’s organize auctions of many items or “lots” to attract buyers and \\nprovide catalogues with details on the items for sale, such as their “provenance” or \\nownership history. \\nThe advantage of unique assets as investments is that you may enjoy collecting and \\nhaving the items as well as watching their value appreciate.

For some, collecting becomes a hobby. \\nThe disadvantages of investing in collectibles are \\n• high probability of mispricing, as markets are inefficient; \\n• lack of liquidity; \\n• lack of earnings, as there are no dividends or interest; \\n• holding costs of the investment. \\nUnless you are knowledgeable about your item and its markets (and even if you are), it \\nis common to suffer from mispricing. Collectibles’ markets are relatively inefficient \\nbecause trading partners vary widely in their knowledge about pricing. Both buyers and \\nsellers try to persuade each other of an asset’s rarity and value. It is easy to be misled \\nand to make mistakes in this market. Online sales and auctions of collectibles at sites \\nsuch as eBay may be fun for hobbyists, but they typically are not good venues for \\ninvestors. \\nIf you are trading through a dealer, you can check the dealer’s reputation through \\nprofessional organizations, local business bureaus, and Internet blogs and Web sites, \\nespecially where customers can provide a rating or critique. You should also always try \\nto find comparable items to compare prices. If feasible, get a second opinion from an \\nindependent appraiser. Knowledge is an important bargaining chip. The more you \\nknow, the more likely you are to be satisfied with your investment decision, even if you \\nultimately walk away from the deal. \\nUnique investments may not be readily saleable, or their markets may be subject to \\ntrends and fashions that cause price volatility. This means that your investment may \\nultimately be a source of gain but that you cannot count on it as a source of liquidity. If \\nyou have foreseeable liquidity needs, it may not be appropriate to tie up your wealth in a \\nChinese vase, autographed baseballs, vintage action figures, or Navajo rugs. \\nThere are no dividends or interest paid while you hold collectibles, so if you have income \\nneeds you should choose a more useful investment. There are also other costs, such as \\nstorage, security, maintenance, and insurance. Your investment actually returns a \\nnegative net cash flow— costs you more than it brings in— until you realize its potential \\ngain by selling it. \\nCollectibles can be a source of joy and a store of wealth, and you may realize a healthy \\nreturn on your investment. In the meantime, however, they create costs so that your \\neventual return will have to be large enough to compensate for those costs to make them \\na really worthwhile investment. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Commodities are raw materials and agricultural products.

She figures that since health care is a growth \\nindustry, with technological advancements and the aging population, she will choose a \\ncareer in health. \\nSome people know what they want to do at an early age. For most people, however, the \\npath is just not that clear. Career planning and development can be a process of trial and \\nerror as you learn your abilities and preferences by trying them out. Sometimes a job is \\nnot what you thought it would be, sometimes you are not who you thought you would \\nbe. The better your decision-making process— the more objective and methodical it is—\\nthe less trial and error you will have to endure. \\nYour financial sustainability depends on having income to support your spending, \\nsaving, and investing. A primary component of your income— especially earlier in your \\nadult life— is income from your wages or salary, that is, from working, selling your labor. \\nYour ability to maximize the price that your labor can bring depends on the labor \\nmarket you choose and your ability to sell yourself. Those abilities will be called on \\nthroughout your working life. You will make job and career choices for many different \\nreasons. This chapter looks only at the financial context of those choices. \\n18.1 Choosing a Job \\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES  \\n1. Describe the macroeconomic factors that affect job markets. \\n2. Describe the microeconomic factors that influence job and career decisions.  \\n3. Relate life stages to both microeconomic factors and income needs.  \\n4. Describe how relationships between life stages, income needs, and microeconomic factors may \\naffect job and career choices. \\nA person starting out in the world of work today can expect to change careers— not just \\njobs— an average of seven times before retiring.[1]  \\nThose career changes may reflect the process of gaining knowledge and skills as you \\nwork or changes in industry and economic conditions over several decades of your \\nworking life. Knowing this, you cannot base career decisions solely on the circumstances \\nof the moment. However, you also cannot ignore the economics of the job market. \\nYou may have a career in mind but have no idea how to get started, or you may have a \\njob in mind but have no idea where it may lead. If you have a career in mind, you should \\nresearch its career path, or sequence of steps that will enable you to advance. Some \\ncareers have a well-established career path— for example, careers in law, medicine, \\nteaching, or civil engineering. In other occupations and professions, career paths may \\nnot be well defined. '),\n",

These will \\ndiffer by field of employment, types of jobs, and geographic region. The opportunities \\noffered in a job market depend on the supply and demand for jobs, which in turn \\ndepend on the need for labor in the broader economy and in a specific industry or \\ngeographic area. \\nThe economic cycle can affect the aggregate job market or employment rate. If the \\neconomy is in a recession, the economy is producing less, and there is less need for \\nlabor, so fewer jobs are available. If the economy is expanding, production and its need \\nfor labor are growing. \\nTypically, a recession or expansion affects different industries in different ways. Some \\nindustries are cyclical and some are countercyclical. For example, in a recession, \\nconsumer spending is often down, so retail shops and consumer goods manufacturers—\\nin cyclical industries— may be cutting jobs. Meanwhile, more people are continuing their \\neducation to improve their skills and the chances of getting a job, which is harder to do \\nin a recession, so jobs in higher education— a countercyclical industry— may be \\nincreasing. \\nFor example, it would have been a bad time in the spring of 2009 to think about a career \\nin auto manufacturing in the United States with Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler all \\nannouncing massive layoffs, plant closings, and facing bankruptcy. The industry may \\nsurvive, but it probably won’t be able to rebuild that fast. \\nGlobal events such as an outbreak of war, the nationalization of a scarce natural \\nresource, the price of a critical commodity such as crude oil, the collapse of a vital \\nindustry, and so on, may also cause changes in the global economy that affect job \\nmarkets. \\nAnother macroeconomic factor is change in technology, which can open up new fields of \\nemployment and make others obsolete. With the advent of digital cameras, for example, \\neven single-use conventional cameras are no longer being manufactured in great \\nquantity, and film developers are not needed as much as they once were. However, there \\nare more jobs for developers of electronic cameras and digital applications for creating \\nimages and using digital images in communications channels, such as mobile phones. \\nFigure 18.2 Workers in the Vacuum Cleaner Factory at Reedsville, West Virginia '),\n",

A historical \\nexample, repeated in many developing countries, is the mass migration of rural families \\nto urban centers and factory towns during an industrial revolution. Changes in the \\ncomposition of a society, such as the average age of the population, also affect job supply \\nand demand. Baby booms create demand for more educators and pediatricians, for \\nexample, while aging populations create more demand for goods and services relating to \\nelder care. \\nSocial and cultural factors affect consumer behavior, and consumer preferences can \\nchange a job market. Demand for certain kinds of products and services, for example, \\nsuch as organic foods, hybrid cars, clean energy, and “green” buildings, can increase job \\nopportunities in businesses that address those preferences. \\nThus, changes in demand for a product or service will change the need for labor to \\nproduce it. On a larger scale, economies typically shift their focus over time as different \\nindustries become “growth” industries, that is, the drivers of growth in the economy. In \\nthe mid-twentieth century, the United States was a manufacturing economy, driven by \\nthe production of durable and consumer goods, especially automobiles. In the 1990s, \\nthe computer/internet/tech sector had a larger role in driving growth in the U.S. \\neconomy due to technological breakthroughs. Currently, education and health care \\nservices are the growing sectors of the economy due to demographic and political \\nchanges and needs.[2]  \\n'),\n",

Ease of entry, \\nin turn, may be affected by macro factors such as the laws and regulations in the state \\nwhere you intend to do business and the existing competition in the market you are \\nentering. \\nThe labor market is competitive, not just at an individual level but on a global, \\nindustrywide scale. As transportation and especially communication technology has \\nimproved, many steps in a manufacturing or even a service process may be outsourced, \\ndone by foreign labor. That competition affects the U.S. job market as jobs are moved \\noverseas, but it also opens new markets in developing economies. You may be interested \\nin an overseas job, as American companies open offices in Asian, South American, \\nAfrican, and other countries. Globalization affects job markets everywhere. \\nMicro Factors of Your Job Market \\nWhether you are employed or self-employed, whether you look forward to going to work \\nevery day or dread it, employment determines how you spend most of your waking \\nhours during most of your days. Employment determines your income and thus your \\nlifestyle, your physical well-being, and to a large extent your satisfaction or emotional \\nwell-being. Everyone has a different idea about what a “good job” is. That idea may \\nchange over a lifetime as circumstances change, but some specific micro factors will \\nweigh on your decisions, including your \\n• abilities, \\n• skills, \\n• knowledge, \\n• lifestyle choices. \\nAbilities are innate talents or aptitudes, what you are capable of or good at. \\nCircumstances may inhibit your use of your abilities or may even cause disabilities. \\nHowever, you often can develop your abilities— and compensate for disabilities—\\nthrough training or practice. Sometimes you don’t even know what abilities you have \\nuntil some experience brings them out. \\nWhen Tomika says she is “good with people” or when Bryon says that he is a “natural \\nathlete,” they are referring to abilities that will make them better at some jobs than \\nothers. Abilities can be developed and may require upkeep; athletic ability, for example, \\nrequires regular fitness workouts to really be maintained. You also may find that you \\nlack some abilities, or think you do because you’ve never tried using them. \\nUsually, by the time you graduate from high school, you are aware of some of your \\nabilities, although you may not be aware of how they may help or hinder you in different \\njobs. Also, your idea of your abilities relative to others may be skewed by your context. \\nFor example, you may be the best writer in your high school, but not compared to a \\nlarger pool of more competitive students. Your high school or college career office may '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 430}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  431 \\nbe able to help you identify your abilities and skills and applying that knowledge to your \\ncareer decisions. \\nYour job choices are not predetermined by your abilities or apparent lack of them. An \\nability can be developed or used in a way you have not yet imagined. A lack of ability can \\nsometimes be overcome by using other talents to compensate. Thus, ability is a factor in \\nyour job decisions, but certainly not the only one. Your knowledge and skills are \\nequally— if not more— important. \\nSkills and knowledge are learned attributes. A skill is a process that you learn to apply, \\nsuch as programming a computer, welding a pipe, or making a customer feel \\ncomfortable making a purchase. Knowledge refers to your education and experience and \\nyour understanding of the contexts in which your skills may be applied. \\nEducation is one way to develop skills and knowledge. In secondary education, a \\nvocational program prepares you to enter the job market directly after high school and \\nfocuses on technical skills such as baking, bookkeeping, automotive repair, or building \\ntrades. A college preparatory program focuses on developing general skills that you will \\nneed to further your formal education, such as reading, writing, research, and \\nquantitative reasoning. \\nPast high school or a year or two of community college, it is natural to question the value \\nof more education. Tuition is real money and must be earned or borrowed, both of \\nwhich have costs. There is also the opportunity cost of the wages you could be earning \\ninstead. \\nEducation adds to your earning power significantly, however, by raising the price of \\nyour labor. The more education you have, the more knowledge and skills you have. The \\nsmaller the supply of labor with your particular knowledge and skills, the higher the \\nprice your labor can command. This relationship is the rationale for becoming \\nspecialized within a career. However, both specialization and versatility may have value \\nin certain job markets, raising the price of your labor. \\nMore education also confers more job mobility— the ability to change jobs when \\nopportunities arise, because your knowledge and skills make you more useful, and thus \\nvaluable, in more ways. Your value as a worker or employee enables you to command \\nhigher pay for your labor. \\nStatistics show a consistent relationship between education and earnings. Over a \\nlifetime of work, say about forty to forty-five years, in the United States a person with a \\ncollege degree will earn over a million dollars more than someone with a high school \\ndiploma. According to a recent study, \\n“There is a positive correlation between higher levels of education and higher earnings \\nfor all racial/ethnic groups and for both men and women…The income gap between high \\nschool graduates and college graduates has increased significantly over time. The \\nearnings benefit is large enough for the average college graduate to recoup both '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 431}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  432 \\nearnings forgone during the college years and the cost of full tuition and fees in a \\nrelatively short period of time.”[3]  \\nNot only are you likely to earn more if you are better educated, but you are also more \\nlikely to have a job with a pension plan, health insurance, and paid vacations— benefits \\nthat add to your total compensation. Although it may seem quite expensive to you now, \\nyour college education is definitely worth it: worth the opportunity cost and worth the \\ndirect costs of tuition, fees, and books.[4]  \\nYour choices will depend on the characteristics and demands of a job and how they fit \\nyour unique constellation of knowledge, skills, personality, characteristics, and \\naptitudes. For example, your knowledge of finance, visual pursuit skills, ability to \\nmanage stress and tolerate risk, aptitude for numerical reasoning, enjoyment of \\ncompetition, and preference to work independently may suit you for employment as a \\nstockbroker or futures trader. Your manual speed and accuracy, verbal comprehension \\nskills, enjoyment of detail work, strong sense of responsibility, desire to work regular \\nhours in a small group setting, and preference for public service may suit you for \\ntraining as a court stenographer. Your word fluency, social skills, communication skills, \\norganizational skills, preference to work with people, and desire to lead others may suit \\nyou for jobs in education or sales. And so on. \\nLifestyle choices affect the amount of income you will need to achieve and maintain your \\nlifestyle and the amount of time you will spend earning income. Lifestyle choices thus \\naffect your career path and job choices in key ways. Typically, when you are beginning a \\ncareer and have few, if any, dependents, you are more willing to sacrifice time and even \\npay for a job that will enhance your skills and help you to progress along your career \\npath. As a journalist, for example, you may volunteer for an overseas post; or as a nurse \\nyou may volunteer for extra rotations. As a computer programmer, you may assist in the \\ndevelopment of open source software. \\nAs you advance in your career, and perhaps become more settled in your life— maybe \\nstart a family— you are less willing to sacrifice your personal life to your career, and may \\nseek out a job that allows you to earn the income that supports your dependents while \\nnot taking away too much of your time. \\nYour income needs typically increase as you have dependents and are trying to save and \\naccumulate wealth, and then decrease when your dependents are on their own and you \\nhave accumulated some wealth. Your sources of income shift as well, from relying on \\nincome from labor earlier in your life to relying on income from investments later. \\nWhen your family has grown and you once again have fewer dependents, you may really \\nenjoy fulfilling your ambitions, as you have decades of skills and knowledge to apply and \\nthe time to apply them. Increasingly, as more people retain their health into older age, \\nthey are working in retirement— earning a wage to improve their quality of life or \\neliminate debt, turning a hobby into a business, or trying something they have always \\nwanted to do. Your life cycle of career development may follow the pattern shown in \\nFigure 18.4 \"Lifecycle Career Development\". '),\n",

Whatever the circumstances, when you look for a job you are seeking a \\nbuyer for your labor. The process of having to “sell” yourself (your time, energy, \\nknowledge, and skills) is always revealing and valuable. \\nFinding a Job Market \\nBefore you can look for a job, you need to have an idea of what job market you are in. \\nThe same macro factors that you consider in your choice of career may make your job \\nsearch easier or harder. Ultimately, they may influence your methods of searching or \\neven your job choice itself. For example, as unemployment has increased in the wake of \\nthe most recent financial crisis, the labor market has become much more competitive. In \\nturn, job seekers have become much more creative about advertising their skills— from \\nbroader networking to papering a neighborhood with brochures on windshields— and \\nmore accepting of job conditions, including lower compensation. A good place to start is \\nthe U.S. Department of Labor’s “Occupational Outlook Handbook.”[1]  \\nThe handbook is updated annually. For hundreds of industries and specific jobs it tells \\nyou the training and education you need, what you will earn and what your job \\nprospects are, what the work entails, and what the working conditions are like. The site \\nalso offers valuable tips on conducting job searches. \\nKnowing the job classification and industry name will focus your search process and \\nmake it more efficient. Once you understand your job market, look at the macro and \\nmicro factors that affect it along with your personal choices. For example, knowing that \\nyou are interested in working in business, transportation, or the leisure and hospitality \\nindustry, you are ready to research that field more and plan your job search. \\nYou are looking for a buyer of your labor, so you need to find the markets where buyers \\nshop. One of the first things to do is find out where jobs in your field are advertised. \\nJobs may be advertised in \\n• trade magazines, \\n• professional organizations or their journals, \\n• career fairs, \\n• employment agencies, \\n• employment Web sites, \\n• government Web sites, \\n• company Web sites, \\n• your school’s career development office. \\nFigure 18.5 \"Sources of Information about Jobs\" describes these venues in more detail. \\nFigure 18.5 Sources of Information about Jobs '),\n",

Browsing jobs online, Sandy discovers there is a \\nstrong seasonal demand for hospitality workers on cruise ships, and this gives her an \\nidea. If the right choice doesn’t come up right away, maybe a summer job working for a \\ncruise line would be a good way to develop her knowledge and skills further while \\nlooking for her dream job in management. \\nSandy needs to research destinations as well as businesses and wants to talk with people \\ndirectly. She knows that cold calls— calling potential employers on the phone as a \\ncomplete unknown— is the hardest way to sell herself. In any industry, cold calling has a \\nmuch lower success rate than calling with a referral or some connection— otherwise \\nknown as networking. \\nNetworking is one of the most successful ways of finding a job. It can take many \\nforms, but the idea is to use whatever professional, academic, or social connections you \\nhave to enlist as many volunteers as possible to help in your job search. According to \\npopular theory, your social networks can be seen as assets that potentially help you \\nbuild wealth. That is, the number and positions of people you can network with and the \\neconomically viable connections you can have with them are a form of capital—\\nsocial capital. \\nWord of mouth is a powerful tool, and the more people know about your job search, the \\nmore likely it is that they or someone they know will learn of opportunities. Sandy’s \\nstrategy also includes joining online career networking sites, such as LinkedIn, and \\ndiscussion lists for people in the hospitality industry. Sandy finds a helpful Yahoo! group \\ncalled The Innkeeper Club and posts a query about what employers look for in a \\nmanager. \\nWhile Sandy was in college getting her degree in hospitality management, her best \\nfriend from high school was happily styling hair in a local salon. Sandy never thought to \\nnetwork through her friend, but it turns out that one of her friend’s clients has a sister \\nwho owns a country inn with her husband, and they are thinking about hiring someone \\nto manage their enterprise. After driving several hours to meet them, Sandy learns they \\nhave changed their minds and are not hiring now. However, they know of two other \\ninnkeepers who may be looking for help. Since they are impressed with Sandy, they are \\nhappy to pass along her name and résumé. \\nThat’s how networking works— you just never know who may be helpful to you. The \\nobvious people to start with are all the people that you know: former professors, former \\nemployers, friends, family, friends of family, friends of friends, family of friends, and so \\non. The more people you can talk with or send your résumé to (i.e., impress), the greater \\nthe chances that someone will make an offer. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 438}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  439 \\nAnother good networking strategy is to call or e-mail people working in the industry, \\nindividuals who are currently in or just above the position you’d like to have, and ask to \\ntalk with them about their work. If you make it clear that you are not asking for or \\nexpecting a job offer from them, many people will be happy to take a half hour to discuss \\ntheir jobs with you. They may have valuable tips or leads for you or be willing to pass \\nalong your name to someone else who does. \\nSelling Yourself: Your Cover Letter and Résumé \\nTo get a job you will have to convince someone who does not know you that you are \\nworth paying for. You have an opportunity to prove that in your cover letter and résumé \\nand again in your interview. \\nThe cover letter, whether mailed or an e-mailed, is your introduction to your prospective \\nemployer. You have three paragraphs on one page to briefly introduce yourself and show \\nhow you can make a profitable contribution to the company. The objective of the cover \\nletter is to get the reader to look at your résumé with a favorable impression of you \\ncreated by the letter. \\nYour first paragraph should establish your purpose in making contact, the reason for the \\nletter. You should make it clear what job you are applying for and why you are making \\nthis particular contact. If someone referred you, mention him or her by name. If you met \\nthe addressee previously, remind him or her where and when that was, for example, “It \\nwas great to chat with you at the Jobs Fair in Cleveland last week.” The more specifically \\nyou can identify yourself and separate yourself from the pool of other job seekers, the \\nbetter. \\nThe second paragraph of your cover letter should summarize your background, \\neducation, and experience. All this information is on your résumé in more detail, so this \\nis not the place to expound at length. You want to show briefly that you are qualified for \\nthe position and have the potential to make a contribution. \\nYour third paragraph is your opportunity to leave the door open for further \\ncommunication. Make it clear where and how you can be reached and how much you \\nappreciate the opportunity to be considered for the position. \\nThe résumé, the summary list of your skills and knowledge, is what will really sell you \\nto an employer, once you have made a good enough impression with the cover letter to \\nget him or her to turn the page. A good résumé provides enough information to show \\nthat you are willing and able to contribute to your employer’s success— that it is worth it \\nto hire you or at least to talk to you in an interview. \\nList the pertinent facts of where and how you can be reached: address, phone number, \\ne-mail address. Your qualifications will be mainly education and experience. List any \\ndegrees, certificates, or training you have completed after high school. Be sure to include '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 439}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  440 \\nanything that distinguishes your academic career, such as honors, prizes, or \\nscholarships. \\nList any employment experience, including summer jobs, even if they don’t seem \\npertinent to the position you are applying for. You may think that being a camp \\ncounselor has nothing to do with being a radiology technician, but it shows that you \\nhave experience working with children and parents, have held a position where you are \\nresponsible for others, and that you are willing to work during your school breaks, thus \\nshowing ambition. If you are starting out and can’t be expected to have lots of \\nemployment experience, employers looks for hints about your character— things like \\nambition, initiative, responsibility— that may indicate your success working for them. \\nInternships that you did in college or high school are also impressive, showing your \\nwillingness to go beyond the standard curriculum and learn by working— something an \\nemployer will expect you to continue to do on the job, too. While you are in school, you \\nshould recognize the value added by experiential learning and the positive impression \\nthat it will make. An internship can also give you a head start in networking if your \\nsupervisor will be a good reference or source of contacts for you. The internship may \\neven result in a job offer; you may not necessarily want to accept, but at the very least, \\nhaving an offer to fall back on takes some of the pressure off your search. \\nFor each job, be clear about the position you held and the two most important duties or \\nroles you performed. Don’t go into too much detail, however. The time to expand on \\nyour story is in the interview. \\nIf you have done internships or volunteer work or if you are a member of civic or \\nvolunteer organizations, be sure to list those as well. They are hints about you as a \\nperson and may help you to stand out in the pool of applicants. \\nA common mistake is to list too much extra information on your résumé and to focus \\ntoo much on what you want. For example, stating an objective such as “to obtain a great \\nposition in hotel management.” Your employer cares about what you can do for the \\ncompany, not for yourself. The following are some tips for developing your résumé: \\n• Avoid adjectives or adverbs when describing your past performance. If you were \\nan achiever in school, that will be reflected in your grades, degrees, honors, and \\nawards. “Hype” can sound boastful; besides, you can discuss your performance in \\ndetail at the interview. \\n• Be honest and state your case without exaggeration. It is easier than ever for \\nemployers to check on your history, and they will. Falsification of information on \\nyour résumé may become grounds for dismissal, if you are hired. \\n• Don’t include personal details unless they are strongly relevant to the job you are \\nseeking. Employers typically do not want to know that you love dogs, were raised \\nin Singapore, or are a single mother. \\n• Be correct. Proofread your résumé and have someone else proof it as well. This is \\nyour opportunity to make a good impression. Any error indicates not just that '),\n",

Employers typically are looking at many résumés \\nto fill one position, so make it easy and quick for the reader to see how qualified \\nyou are. \\nA myriad of sample résumés and sample cover letters may be found online, but be wary \\nof templates that may not fit you or your prospective job. Employers in your field may \\nhave particular expectations for what should be on your résumé or how it should be \\nstructured. Maybe you should list your skills or perhaps your education first. Perhaps it \\nwould be preferable to list your past employment experiences in reverse chronology \\n(with your most recent job first). Advice is plentiful about how to write a résumé, but \\nthere is no one right way or best way. Choose an appropriate style and format for your \\njob category that will present you in the best possible light as a prospective employee. \\nMany employers want you to fill out an application form independently of or instead of a \\nrésumé. They may also ask for references, especially from former employers who are \\nwilling to recommend you. Be aware that hirers and human resources department \\npersonnel routinely follow up on references and letters of recommendation. Find out \\nmore about filling out employment applications at About.com at \\nhttp://jobsearch.about.com/cs/jobapplications/a/jobapplication.htm and other sites. \\nThere are many resources available in print and online to help you write a good résumé. \\nIn addition, résumé writing workshops and short courses are often held at community \\ncolleges or adult education centers.[4]  \\nSelling Yourself: Your Interview \\nThe interview— a face-to-face conversation with a prospective employer— is your chance \\nto get an offer. You want to make a good personal impression: dress professionally but \\nin clothes that fit well and comfortably. Be polite and cordial but also careful not to \\nassume too familiar a tone. \\nYou may be asked a series of predetermined questions, or your interviewer may let the \\nconversation develop through open-ended questions. The interviewer may let you \\nestablish its direction in order to learn more about how you think. However the \\nconversation is guided, you want to be able to showcase your suitability for the job and \\nwhat you bring to it.

Behavioral interviews emphasize your past actions as \\nindicators of how you might perform in the future. The so-called STAR Method is a \\ngood approach to answering behavioral questions, as it helps you to be systematic and \\nspecific in making your past work experiences relevant to your present job quest. The \\nSTAR Method[5]  \\nis a process of conveying specific situations, actions, and outcomes in response to an \\ninterviewer’s question about something you did. \\n• Situation: Give specific details about the situation and its context. \\n• Task: Describe the task or goal that arose in response to the situation. \\n• Action: Describe what you did and who was involved. \\n• Result: Describe the (positive) outcome. \\nFor example: \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Personal Finance.pdf', 'page': 442}, page_content='Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books  Saylor.org \\n  443 \\nQuestion: We are looking for someone who is willing to take initiative in keeping our \\noffice systems working efficiently and who can work without a lot of direct supervision. \\nDoes that describe you? \\nAnswer: Absolutely. For example, in my last job I noticed that the office supply system \\nwas not working well. People were running out of what they needed before letting me \\nknow what to order (Situation). I thought there needed to be a better way to anticipate \\nand fill those needs based on people’s actual patterns of use (Task). So, I conducted a \\npoll on office supply use and used that information to develop a schedule for the \\nautomatic resupply of key items on a regular basis (Action). The system worked much \\nmore smoothly after that. I mentioned it in my next performance review, and my boss \\nwas so impressed that she put me in for a raise (Results). \\nThere are some questions employers should not ask you, however. Unless the \\ninformation is a legal requirement for the job you are interviewing for, \\nantidiscrimination laws make it illegal for an employer to ask you your age; your height \\nor weight; personal information such as your racial identity, sexual orientation, or \\nhealth; or questions about your marital status and family situation, such as the number \\nof children you have, whether you are single, or if you are pregnant or planning to start a \\nfamily. \\nIt is also important for you to have questions to ask in an interview, so you should \\nprepare a few questions for your interviewer. Questions could be about the company’s \\nproducts or services, the company’s mission or goals, the work you would be doing, who \\nyou would be reporting to, where you would be located, and the opportunities for \\nadvancement. You want your question to be specific enough to show that you have \\nalready done some research on the company, its products, and markets. This is a chance \\nto demonstrate your knowledge of the job, company, or industry— that you have done \\nyour homework— as well as your interest and ambition. \\nUnless your interviewer mentions compensation, don’t bring it up. Once you have the \\njob offer, then you can discuss compensation, but in the interview you want to focus on \\nwhat you can do for the company, not what the company can do for you. \\nYou can also use the interview to learn more about the company. Try to pick up clues \\nabout the company’s mission, corporate culture, and work environment. Are people \\nwearing business attire or “business casual”? Are there cubicles and private offices or a \\nmore open workspace? Are people working in teams, or is it more of a conventional \\nhierarchy? You want to be in a workplace where you can be comfortable and productive. \\nBe open-minded— you may be able to work quite well in an environment you have never \\nworked in before— but think about how you can do your best work in that environment. \\nAfter your interview, send a thank you note, and follow up with a phone call if you don’t \\nhear back. You may ask your interviewer for feedback— so that you can learn for future \\ninterviews— but don’t be surprised and be gracious, if you don’t get it. Always leave the \\ndoor open. You never know.

If any of that information is \\nmissing, you should ask about it. \\nIn many jobs, you may be asked to do many things, especially in entry-level jobs, so the \\njob description may be fairly vague. Your willingness to do whatever is asked of you \\n(within the law and according to ethical standards) should be compensated by what you \\nstand to gain from the job— in pay or in new knowledge and experience or in positioning \\nyourself for your next job. Some jobs are better looked at as a kind of graduate \\neducation. \\nYour compensation includes not only your wages or salary but also any benefits that \\nthe employer provides. As you read in previous chapters, benefits may include health \\nand dental insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, and a retirement plan. \\nCompensation also includes time off, sick days, and vacation days. You should \\nunderstand the company’s policies and flexibility in applying them. \\nKnow what your total compensation will be and whether it is reasonable for the job, \\nindustry, and current job market. Asking around may help, especially on online \\ndiscussion groups with relative anonymity. People often are reluctant to disclose their \\ncompensation, and companies discourage sharing this information because it typically \\nreveals discrepancies. For example, people hired in the past may be receiving less (or \\nmore) pay than people hired recently for the same position. In addition, gender gap— in \\nwhich men receive higher pay than women in the same position— is often a problem. \\nTo gauge how reasonable a job offer is, you can research professional associations about \\npay scales or find statistical averages by profession or region. Online resources include \\nsimple salary comparison calculators, such as the one at http://monster.salary.com. You \\nalso will find data and related articles linking salaries to specific job titles, area codes, \\nstates, educational levels, and years of work experience, for example, at \\nhttp://www.payscale.com/research/US/Country=United_States/Salary. \\nRealistically compare the job offer to your needs. Different geographic areas have \\ndifferent costs of living, for example, so the same salary may afford you a very different \\nlifestyle in Omaha than in New York City. Your employment compensation is most likely \\nan important source— perhaps your only source— of income. That income finances your \\nplan for spending, saving, and investing. A budget can help you to see if that income will \\nbe sufficient to meet your financial goals. If you already have financial responsibilities—\\nstudent loans, car loans, or dependents, for example— you may find that you can’t afford \\nthe job. \\nYou can negotiate your compensation offer; many employers expect you to try, but some \\nwill just stand by their offer— take it or leave it. Your ability to negotiate depends in part \\non the number of candidates for that particular job and how quickly the employer needs '),\n",

You will find guidelines online for evaluating job offers and negotiating your \\ncompensation, for example, among the useful links at \\nhttp://www.rileyguide.com/offers.html. Another resource includes the simple “Job \\nOffer Checklist” at http://www.collegegrad.com/offer. \\nIn some cases, your employer may offer you a contract, a legal agreement that details \\nyour responsibilities and compensation and your employer’s responsibilities and \\nexpectations. As with any contract, you should thoroughly understand it before signing. \\nIf you will be employed as a member of a trade union or labor union under a \\ncollective bargaining agreement, the terms of the contract may be applicable to all \\nunion members and therefore not negotiable by individual employees. \\nIt is exciting to get a job offer, but don’t let the excitement overwhelm your good sense. \\nBefore you accept a job, feel positive that you can live with it. You never really know \\nwhat a job is like until you do, but it is better to go into it optimistically.

Describe the processes of voluntary job loss. \\n2. Describe the processes of involuntary job loss. \\n3. Identify the financial impacts of an involuntary job loss. \\n4. Identify major federal legislation that addresses employment issues and describe its importance \\nin labor markets. \\nStatistically, it is almost impossible for you to expect to have one job or career for your \\nentire working life. At least once and possibly many times, you will change jobs or even \\ncareers. You will have to leave your current or former job and find another. Handling \\nthat transition can be difficult, especially if the transition is not what you would have \\npreferred. How you handle that transition may affect your success or satisfaction with \\nyour next position. \\nYou may leave your job voluntarily or involuntarily. When you leave voluntarily, \\npresumably you have had a chance to make a reasoned decision and have decided that \\nthe net benefits of moving on are more than the net benefits of staying. \\nLeaving Voluntarily \\nYou may decide to leave a job and move to another for the following reasons: \\n• move to a position with more responsibility, opportunity to advance, or \\ncompensation \\n• be in a more compatible work environment or corporate culture \\n• learn a new skill \\n• become self-employed by beginning an entrepreneurial venture \\n• make a transition from a military to a civilian job \\nIn other cases, you may leave employment permanently or temporarily because of the \\nfollowing reasons: '),\n",

If you have \\ndependents, you will have to consider how your decision may affect their lives too. \\nSince your job is a source of income, leaving your job means a loss of that income. You \\nneed to consider how you can maintain or change your current use of income (i.e., \\nspending and saving levels) with that loss. \\nIf you are changing jobs, your new job will replace that income with new income that is \\nmore than, equal to, or less than your old paycheck. If it is equal to or more than your \\nformer income, you may maintain or even expand your spending, saving, and investing \\nactivities. Extra income will provide you with more choices of how to consume or save. If \\nit is less than your former income, you will have to decrease your spending or saving to \\nfit your current needs. Your budget can help you foresee the effects of your new income \\non your spending and saving. \\nIf you are leaving employment, then there will be no replacement income, so your \\nspending and saving activities should reflect that loss, unless you have an alternative \\nsource of income to replace it. If you are going on to graduate school, perhaps you have a \\nfellowship or scholarship. If you are assuming family care responsibilities, perhaps \\nanother family member has offered financial support. If you are retiring, you should \\nhave income from invested capital (e.g., your retirement savings) that can be used to \\nreplace your wages or salary. \\nIf you are initiating the job change, be sure you try to cause the least disruption and cost \\nto your employer. Let your employer know of your decision as soon as is practical, and \\ncertainly before anyone else in the company knows. “Two weeks notice” is the \\nconvention, but the more notice you can give, the less inconvenience you may cause. \\nOffer to help train your successor or be available to provide information or assist in the \\ntransition. The more cordially you leave your job, the better your relationship with your \\nformer employer will be, which may reflect well on you in future networking. \\nIf you participated in a defined contribution retirement plan you own those funds to the \\nextent that you are vested in your employer’s contributions and have contributed your \\nown funds.

Working retirees and those in the health care \\nand Internet industries were the most satisfied, while workers under thirty and those \\nworking in finance-related fields were the least satisfied. At the time of the survey, about \\n60 percent of workers were looking around for another job, despite most claiming they \\nwere generally satisfied with their wages or salaries. Many were worried about being laid \\noff in a down economy.[2]  \\nAs you can see, many micro and macro factors may enter into a decision to leave a job. \\nYou spend many of your waking hours working, and deciding to change jobs is about \\nmuch more than just income. It is still a decision about income, however, so you should \\ncarefully weigh the effects of that decision on your personal financial well-being. \\nLeaving Involuntarily \\nIf you leave your job involuntarily, you will have to make adjustments for a loss of \\nincome that you were not planning to make. That may be difficult, but not so much as \\nyou think. \\nInvoluntary job loss may be due to your employer’s decision, an accident or disability, or \\nunexpected circumstances, such as the acquisition, merger, downsizing, or closing of the '),\n",

Your employer also may decide to lay you off or fire you. A layoff \\nimplies a temporary job loss due to a circumstance in which your employer needs or can \\nafford less labor. \\nIf the layoff is due to an economic recession when there is less demand for the product \\nyou create, then it may be affecting your entire industry. That would mean you would \\nhave a harder time finding a similar job. If layoffs are widespread enough, however, \\nthere may be federal, state, or local government programs aimed at helping the many \\npeople in your situation, such as a retraining program or temporary income assistance. \\nYou may get laid off because your employer is no longer as competitive or profitable and \\nso has to cut costs or because the company has lost financing. If the layoffs are specific \\nto your employer, you may be able to find a similar position with another company or \\nyou may be able to establish your own competitive business in the same industry. \\nWhen you are fired, the employer permanently terminates your employment based on \\nyour performance. Involuntary termination, or getting fired, will cause a sudden \\nloss of income that usually requires sudden adjustments to spending and saving. You \\nmay have to use your accumulated savings to finance your expenditures until that \\nincome can be replaced by a new job. \\nAn injury or illness— to you or a dependent— may create a temporary or permanent \\ninvoluntary job loss. It usually also means a period of unemployment. Depending on the \\ncircumstances, your employer may be willing to help ease the transition, perhaps by \\noffering you a more flexible schedule, adjusting your responsibilities, or providing \\nspecialized equipment to enable you to do a job. \\nBy law, employers may not discriminate against people with disabilities so long as they \\nare able to do a job. A job accommodation is any reasonable adjustment to a job or \\nwork environment that makes it possible for an individual with a disability to perform or \\ncontinue to perform job duties. \\nIf you become disabled and unable to work, you may be able to replace some or all of \\nyour wage income with insurance coverage, if you have disability insurance that covers \\nthe specific circumstances (as discussed in Chapter 10 \"Personal Risk Management: \\nInsurance\"). If your disability is permanent, you may qualify for federal assistance \\nthrough Social Security. If someone else is liable for your disability, in the case of an \\naccident or through negligence, his or her insurance coverage may provide some benefit, \\nor you may have a legal claim that could provide a financial settlement. \\nIf your employer initiates your job change, be sure to discuss his or her obligations to \\nyou before you leave. Some employer responsibilities are prescribed by law, as shown in \\nFigure 18.11 \"Major U.S. Employment Legislation\". Other responsibilities are prescribed \\nby union contract, if applicable, and some are conventions or courtesies that your \\nemployer may— or may not— choose to extend. '),\n",

For being able to keep track of the following \\nchapters, we suggest the Reader studying the next few pages thoroughly.  \\nThe balance sheet is a ﬁnancial statement that represents an economic agent’s (a \\nhousehold, a company, a bank, a budgetary institution etc.) wealth by two approaches. \\nAssets are listed on the left-hand side or asset side, resources ﬁnancing the assets are \\nlisted on the right-hand side or liability-equity side. The balance sheet is always in \\nbalance, that is:\\nASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY\\nWhen constructing the balance sheet, assets are listed ﬁrst, then liabilities. Shareholders’ \\nequity is always a residual, i.e. it is the diﬀerence between assets and liabilities. The \\nequity of a company or a bank is frequently referred to as capital, which can lead to \\nmisunderstandings. In this context, capital is not a pile of cash that can be invested. It is \\nonly a notional entry that shows what would be left if all the company’s debts were \\nrepaid. A negative book value of the capital means that the company is insolvent in the \\nlong run, i.e. it cannot repay all of its liabilities. \\nExample: the balance sheet of a company \\nCompany “ABC” has 57,000 EUR worth of assets that are partially ﬁnanced by long- and \\nshort-term liabilities. Long-term (or non-current) liabilities - such as bonds issued or mortgages \\n- are due over 12 months. Short-term (or current) liabilities - such as bills or taxes payable - \\nmature within 12 months.\\nEconomic events can change the balance sheet in four ways:\\n• both sides increase by the same amount \\n• both sides decrease by the same amount \\n• the asset side is restructured, i.e. some assets increase and others decrease \\n• the liability-equity side is restructured, i.e. some liabilities or equity items increase and \\nothers decrease \\nABC Company, Balance sheet, at 31-Dec-2017\\nAssets  (EUR)                            Liabilities  (EUR)                         \\nLand                            25,000 Long-term liabilities       15,000\\nMachinery                   20,000 Short-term liabilities         3,000      \\nInventories                     4,000 Equity   (EUR)              39,000           \\nSupplies                            6,000\\nCash                               2,000\\nTotal assets:                  57,000 Total liabilities and equity: 57,000\\n\\t\\t \\x004'),\n",

Real economic goods  \\nare on the asset side of one single balance sheet,  while ﬁnancial goods  appear in  two \\nbalance sheets simultaneously: on the asset side of one balance sheet and on the liability-\\nequity side of another one. A slice of bread or a bicycle are real economic goods; a \\nmortgage loan, a commercial bill or a share are ﬁnancial goods. \\nFinancial goods on the liability-equity side are obligations, while those on the asset side \\nare claims.  A commercial bill with the nominal value of 500 EUR is a claim to its owner \\nand an obligation for its issuer. The issuer is legally bound to pay 500 EUR when the bill \\nmatures. In case of default - i.e. if the issuer is not able or not willing to pay -, the owner \\nof the bill can sue the issuer. \\nShares might be regarded as ﬁnancial assets too, although in this case the issuer is not \\nlegally bound to pay any money. Shares are rather economic than legal promises to pay \\ndividends or provide capital gains through the appreciation of their price. Disappointed \\nowners - in case of no dividend payments and no price increase - can punish the issuer \\ncompany on the market by selling the shares. What happens if investors start selling the \\nshares of some company en masse? The price of the shares plummets which leads to the \\nsimultaneous devaluation of the assets of the company. (Remember, the value of the \\nassets always has to be equal to the summed value of the liabilities and the equity. A \\nprice drop of shares devalues equity and assets simultaneously.)

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='CHAPTER 2 MONEY AND BANKING FROM A HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE \\n2.1 Money in history and theory \\nThe historical emergence of money can be related to the emergence of market-based \\neconomies. For thousands of years, communities were organised by redistributive \\ninstitutions, centralised rules coordinated production, consumption, investment, etc. \\nAncient Egypt and Babylonia are the most typical examples of redistributive empires, but \\neven in the feudalistic European kingdoms, markets played only a minor role for a long \\ntime. (Polányi, 1944: Chapter 4) These markets are frequently described as places where \\nrural farmers and urban manufacturers exchanged their products directly. However, it is \\neasy to see that barter is a very ineﬃcient way of exchange, as the probability of double \\ncoincident of wants is low and by the growth of the number of market participants, it gets \\neven lower. There is no historical proof that direct barter has ever played an important role \\nin coordinating markets (Wray, 1993). Since the very advent of locally organised markets, \\nbuyers and sellers have been using a commonly accepted speciﬁc good as the medium \\nof exchange. Primitive forms of money had been used before as store of value and \\nstandard of deferred payments, but in lack of markets, they have not functioned as the \\nmedium of exchange or the measure of value (Polányi, 1957). The most important \\nfunction of ancient coins was probably the fact that the state (the king or the queen) \\naccepted them when paying the taxes. This characteristic made primitive money \\ngenerally acceptable on markets: as everyone had to pay taxes, sellers accepted coins \\nbecause they knew they could (and in most cases, they should!) use them for tax \\npayment, and they knew that other sellers from whom they would buy goods were \\nthinking in the same way. It is tautological, but money is accepted because it is thought to \\nbe accepted.  \\nFrom this short introduction it has to be clear that money is deﬁned by its functions, i.e. \\nwe call something money if it is a\\n• medium of exchange, \\n• standard of deferred payments, \\n• store of value, \\n• measure of value. \\nMoney as a means of exchange helps market-coordination in several dimensions. As \\nmentioned above, general acceptance simpliﬁes trade by splitting long and hard \\ndiscoverable chains of exchanges into small parts. Without money, theoretically, the \\neconomy as a whole must ﬁnd the market-clearing exchanges simultaneously to avoid \\ndisequilibrium. This cannot be implemented without the knowledge of some central \\nplanner, who, of course, does not exist. Besides, the use of money spares information: in \\na barter economy with N kinds of goods, the number of relative prices that market \\nparticipants have to remember is \\x00 , whereas in an economy with N kinds of \\nN*(N − 1)\\n2\\n\\t\\t \\x007'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='goods and money, the number of absolute prices is \\x00 . If \\x00 , the size of the \\ninformation set is 4,950 and 100 in the two cases respectively. \\nIn a monetised economy, debt is easy to measure and administer with the help of money, \\nby which the two sides of a transaction (service and payment) can be separated in time. \\nExpressing debts in monetary terms leads to more eﬃcient economic, social and legal \\nprocedures. For example, economic agents do not need to pay taxes by sacriﬁcing their \\nlabour and working for the state anymore. The state can collect taxes paid in money, and \\nthen pay for a competent workforce to execute special jobs. (Without money, some John \\nhas to work on state-owned farms or must serve as a soldier. The problem is that being \\nan excellent wool-manufacturer, John knows nothing about agriculture or warfare. If \\ninstead, he pays taxes in money, skilled farmers and soldiers can be hired.) Another \\nexample from the ﬁeld of jurisdiction: in a society without money, a culprit always has to \\nbe imprisoned, executed or sentenced to penal servitude. However, with money, in a lot \\nof cases, the sinner can literally pay for his sins.\\nMoney as a store of value secures future both in the short- and in the long-run. Between \\ntwo exchanges, the purchasing power can rest in money, which creates the possibility of \\nintertemporal optimisation. The store of value and the standard of deferred payments \\nfunctions are closely connected. Surplus agents (those who spent less in a period than \\nthey earned) can ﬁnance deﬁcit agents. The claim of surplus agents serves as the store of \\ntheir postponed consumption, while the debt of deﬁcit agents is the price of their \\nimpatience for which they will pay later. \\nMoney measures the value of goods, services, wealth, debt, etc., which makes these \\nthings comparable. With money usage, a price can be assigned not only to exchangeable \\nproducts but even to unmarketable stuﬀ like works of art, clear environment or life. It is \\nneedless to say that the measure of value and the means of exchange functions are hand \\nin hand with each other - exchanges are based on the knowledge of prices expressed in \\nmonetary units. \\nThe transition from redistributive societies to market economies had been a long process, \\nduring which not only goods but labour and capital also became the subjects of \\nexchange. This evolution was accompanied by diﬀerent mutations in the monetary \\nsystem. Financial innovations were partially forced by the requirements of growing \\nmarkets, as money supply had to keep pace with economic development. On the other \\nhand, the interests of the state (and not necessarily those of the public…) lead to notable \\nalterations of money and monetary institutions as well. In the next section, we will \\nexamine the most important changes through the lenses of an accountant, i.e. we will \\nintensively use the techniques familiarised in the ﬁrst chapter of this book.

Miners are obliged by law to surrender their gold to the Mint who issues \\nstamped gold currency after the coinage. Coins are legal tender in the economy which \\nmeans that producers, merchants, shop owners, etc., must accept them in exchange for \\ntheir goods. On the other side, buyers are also obliged by the legal tender law to use \\ncoins as a medium of exchange. However, upon mutual agreements, parties are allowed \\nto use alternative settlements in a given business situation. Summing up: if the buyer \\nwants to pay with gold coins the seller must accept them; if the seller wants to be paid in \\ngold coins the buyer must adapt; if they both agree they can use diﬀerent methods. \\nBefore the introduction of coinage and legal tender laws, a price system consisting of \\nrelative prices (for instance 10 kilograms of bread = 1 pair of boots) had evolved in the \\neconomy. An important vector of this system measured the values of goods in terms of \\ngold (Figure 1). \\nFIGURE 1: PRICES BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF COINAGE. \\nThe Royal Mint minted one ounce of gold into 10 pieces of coins with the nominal value \\nof 1 shilling stamped on them (or the equivalent of it, for example, 2 pieces of 5 shilling \\ncoins). One shilling as a measurement of mass equals one-ﬁfth of an ounce, thus the \\nRoyal Mint issued coins that contained half of the quantity of gold of their nominal value. \\nHowever, because of the legal tender law, economic agents had to accept these coins at \\nnominal value. Thus the price system changed (Figure 2).\\nFIGURE 2: PRICES AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF COINAGE. \\nWhat happened at the Mint? The miner sold 1 ounce of gold for 5 shillings, the Mint kept \\nthe rest. Suppose that the unit cost of minting 1 ounce of gold was 1 shilling.

It is worth to notice that mining is not an exchange of goods or services, \\nthus no other balance sheet has to be involved when accounting for it.\\nFor the sake of simplicity, the costs of mining were set aside, or put it in another way, the result \\nof the mining reﬂected by Figure 3 is the net result after deducting the costs.\\nFIGURE 3: ACCOUNTING FOR THE MINING OF 1 OUNCE OF GOLD. \\nSurrendering his gold and getting the proceeds after coinage rearranges the balance \\nsheet of the miner: he is relieved of his gold, half of which being his liability and receives 5 \\nshillings in gold coins.

However, there are practical and \\neconomic problems with coin usage. For security reasons, especially in wholesale \\ncommerce, transportation and shipment costs of the gold currency can be enormous. \\nBesides that, coins wear oﬀ with intensive circulation thus the ratio between their face \\nvalue (nominal value) and real value increases. As sellers have to accept coins at their \\nface value, buyers pay with worn ones. Gresham’s law prevails: bad quality money drives \\nout good quality money from circulation  as the former is used as a means of exchange, \\nwhile the latter is used in the function of store of value. \\nThe most important economic problem is the relative shortage of money. This occurs \\nwhen the growth rate of the real economy is higher than the growth rate of gold-mining, \\nand the velocity of circulation cannot compensate for the diﬀerence. The Fisher-equation \\n(1) helps to understand this phenomenon. \\n\\x00 \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t (1)\\nOn the right-hand side of the equation, \\x00  measures the nominal value of economic \\ntransactions in a given period of time. This is the scalar product of the ordered \\x00  and \\x00\\nvectors: a \\x00  pair denotes the price and the quantity of the i-th transaction, thus the \\n\\x00  product is the nominal value of the i-th transaction. The summation of all \\ntransactions ( \\x00 ) is the nominal value of all economic aﬀairs in the \\nexamined time period. \\nThe left-hand side of the Fisher-equation measures the monetary side of the economy. \\nOne piece of coin can mediate more transactions in a given time period (“A” pays “B” \\nwith this coin, “B” pays “C” with the same coin, etc.) The velocity of money  (\\x00 ) is the \\naverage number of transactions a given coin takes part in . Last but not least, \\x00  is the \\nquantity of money in the economy. \\nIn each and every atomic transaction, money and goods with the same value ﬂow in the \\nopposite directions, so the Fisher-equation seems to be a mere identity. However, in order \\nto hold this identity at the end of every time period, the dynamics of the two sides have to \\nadapt to each other. The nominal value of transactions ( \\x00 ) can increase only if the \\nnominal value of money circulation ( \\x00 ) follows the growth. Out of the two factors on \\nthe monetary side, the velocity of money is constrained by institutional reasons (Bordo - \\nJonung, 1987).\\nFirst, the structure of the economy determines how often money should change hands. \\nAn economy where production is vertically integrated requires fewer money ﬂows than a \\nhorizontally integrated one.

Though the \\nstructure of economies is changing constantly, this evolution is a slow process, and so \\nthe velocity of circulation adjusts gradually.\\nSecond, the development level of the payment and settlement systems determines how \\neasily money can change hands. In a pure cash economy, parties must meet physically to \\nhand over a payment, whereas, with electronic payment systems, this process is much \\nfaster though still bounded. \\nThere could be special circumstances when the velocity of circulation increases beyond these \\nboundaries. During hyperinﬂation money loses its function of store of value, as economic \\nagents expecting fast growing prices try to exchange money for goods even if they do not \\nneed those goods to consume. This, of course, reinforces the hyperinﬂation process. However, \\nhyperinﬂation or even inﬂation triggered by excessive growth of money supply is unimaginable \\nin a commodity money system. The reverse case prevails: the insuﬃcient money supply can \\nlead to deﬂating prices and as agents in the hope of further decreasing prices postpone their \\nconsumption to a slowing economy.\\nAs the velocity of money is constrained, the growth rate of the quantity of money should \\nadapt to the growth rate of the nominal value of transactions in the long run. In a \\nmonetary system where commodity-money is the result of production (mining and \\nminting) and the material of it is scarce, the rate of economic growth will be constrained, \\nsooner or later, by the growth rate of the quantity of money. This situation is called the \\nrelative shortage of money. \\nThe practical and economic problems of coin-usage described above lead to ﬁnancial \\ninnovations that eventually changed the whole monetary system. First of all, in our \\nimagined economy, private agents founded depository institutions. Anyone could depose \\nhis gold coins in one of these institutions who issued promissory notes (or simply, notes) \\nin exchange. A promissory note is a written promise of the issuer to pay at sight the \\nappropriate amount of gold coins. That is, whenever someone turns in a 10 shilling note, \\nthe issuer must immediately redeem it into 10 shillings in coins. Notes are not legal \\ntender, however, as long as market participants believe that they can be converted into \\ncoins, notes - upon mutual agreement - can be used as means of exchange. \\nWhat happens when a merchant places gold coins in a depository institution? He swaps \\nmoney for notes, which is a structural change on the asset side of his balance sheet. Both \\nsides of the depository’s balance sheet increase: money appears on the asset side, while \\nthe promise of paying this money out whenever it is demanded, is a new liability (Figure \\n5). The note is a ﬁnancial instrument: it is the asset of the merchant and simultaneously, \\nthe liability of the issuer. In its physical form, it is at the merchant, the term “ promissory \\nnote” in the depository’s balance sheet is the name of this special liability. The note is a \\nsecurity as well, it can be traded away on the market either for money or for some goods. \\nThe promise embodied in the note is not personal: it is not the merchant but any future \\nowner of the note who can ask for the redemption. \\nIt is worth to emphasise that promissory notes were convertible to gold coins by anyone \\nand anytime at face value.

As depository institutions proved to be trustworthy, note owners did not worry \\nabout the security of convertibility. Practically, private businesses began to replace coins \\nwith notes. However, as note issuance did not change the total amount of circulating \\nmedia of exchange, the problem of relative money shortage was still to be solved. \\nIt is worth to notice that funding and managing a depository institution described above is \\nnot a proﬁtable activity.

Shortly after the introduction of this new activity, managers observed a very \\ninteresting phenomenon: the bulk of borrowers, immediately after signing the contract, \\nwithout even leaving the building, deposited their borrowed coins, i.e. they changed their \\ngold coins for promissory notes. This seemingly weird act is quite understandable: \\ndebtors needed purchasing power, they wanted to buy something on the market, and for \\npractical reasons, by that time notes have become more popular than coins. Promissory \\nnotes substituted gold coins perfectly in their functions of payment and medium of \\nexchange, besides, their physical characteristics, such as weight and portability made \\nthem easier to use than coins. As a consequence of this observation, managers made an \\neﬃciency modiﬁcation to the lending business: by signing the credit-contract, borrowers \\nreceived promissory notes directly. Of course, anyone could redeem the notes into coins, \\nbut only the minority of costumers did so. \\nWhat happens to the balance sheets of the diﬀerent parties?

If \\x00  is 6% then a debtor has to pay 6 shillings of \\ninterest on a 100 shilling debt annually. If the maturity of the loan is less than one year, the \\ndebtor pays less interest (for example 3 shillings for half a year). If the debt matures over one \\nyear, this 6 percent must be paid accordingly. \\nLet \\x00  denote the unit cost of managing a loan.

A commercial bill is a security embodying the short-term debt  of a \\nmerchant who is unable to pay upon delivery. Instead, he promises to pay later by signing \\nthe bill. If the supplier does not want his business to fail, he accepts the bill that he can \\ntrade away later, i.e. he can use the IOU of the original issuer (the merchant) to pay for \\nsome shipment. (See Figure 7 for accounting details.) Commercial bills are not legal \\ntender, thus, as mentioned before, a mutual agreement between the trading partners is \\nneeded to settle business with them. The liquidity of bills depends on the trustworthiness \\nof the issuer. If “A” wants to pay “B” with the bill issued by “C”, “B” will accept this form \\nof payment only if he believes either that “C” is able to repay when the bill matures or \\nsome “D” will accept the bill in some later transaction.

The two cases diﬀer only technically, as in the ﬁrst case the bank \\nmerely signs or stamps the commercial bill (this is the “bank’s acceptance”), which \\nguarantees payment if the issuer defaults, while in the second case, the bank writes its \\nown IOU and swaps the commercial bill for it.

The \\ndiﬀerence between the nominal value of the commercial bill and the discounted amount \\npaid for it generates proﬁt for the bank. \\nHistorically it was a long process til the banks started to discount commercial bills by \\nissuing promissory notes.

A banker’s bill without \\nmaturity is essentially a promissory note: it is convertible to gold on demand. Thus, now \\nthe bank has to match cash outﬂows triggered by redemption with cash inﬂows from \\nmaturing commercial bills. This business could be managed by changing the discount \\nrate, i.e. the rate by which incoming commercial bills were valued.

Before the \\nmodern era of market-based economies, kings and queens frequently went into war \\nagainst their creditors or executed them as the most eﬃcient way of decreasing debt. \\nThese ancient methods of debt management, however, faded away over time.

Banknotes are the liabilities \\nof the central bank.\\nThe signiﬁcance of this change is worth to emphasise. Before the founding of the central \\nbank, gold coins and promissory notes issued by diﬀerent banks were circulating in the \\neconomy, but only the coins were legal tender. The acceptance of the notes issued by \\nany bank depended on trust, i.e. on the belief that the bank is ready and able to convert \\nthem into coins. The acceptance of the central bank’s banknotes is, however, forced by \\nthe law, which makes these notes and the coins equivalent.

Ordinary banks gradually substituted their gold coin reserves with \\nbanknotes issued by the central bank, which was rationalised by the convertibility of  \\nbanknotes to gold coins. As economic agents (and banks as well) could redeem paper \\ncurrency to gold at the central bank, it was enough for the banks to hold the central \\nbank’s banknotes as reserves. If costumers wanted to convert their promissory notes \\nissued by some bank to gold, they could do it in two steps: ﬁrst, they applied for \\nredemption to the issuer of the promissory note, then they could convert the given \\nbanknotes to gold at the central bank. \\nFor the recommendation of the central bank, members of the banking system made their \\ncostumers use checking accounts instead of promissory notes, thus promissory notes \\ngradually vanished from circulation. A checking account is a liability of a bank that can be \\nused for withdrawing cash (central bank notes in our case) or, with the help of a \\ncheckbook, for buying goods. In the latter case, the account holder gives a signed \\npreprinted check to the seller of the good. Later, the seller can turn in the check to his \\nown bank who deposits the amount written on the check on the seller’s account. \\nExample: checking accounts 1 \\n“A” has a checking account at bank “X”, and “B” has a checking account at bank “Y”. “B” \\nbuys goods from “A” for 13 shillings and pays with a check. “A” turns in the check to bank “X”, \\nwho deposits 13 shillings on “A”’s account then contacts bank “Y”. “Y” debits “B”’s account \\nwith 13 shillings and pays bank “X” in banknotes.

(See Figure 12 for accounting details.) \\nFIGURE 12: THE HIERARCHICAL MONETARY SYSTEM. \\nThe ultimate phase in the evolution of this system was the suspension of convertibility of \\nbanknotes to gold, which was triggered by a series of monetised budget deﬁcits. As \\nmentioned at the beginning of this section, the crown founded the central bank in order to \\ncreate an institution at hand who willingly ﬁnances current deﬁcits and maturing debts. \\nThe method of ﬁnancing is the purchase of treasury bonds issued by the state. The \\ncentral bank buys these bonds by printing banknotes, by which the state gains \\npurchasing power to spend. As long as the additional money supply does not exceed the \\nmoney demand generated by economic growth, this can be considered a proper and \\nrightful procedure (Bánﬁ-Hagelmayer, 1989). It is worth to notice that whenever a private \\nagent borrows from a bank, who grants the loan by issuing promissory notes or \\ndepositing the checking account, technically the same thing happens: some deﬁcit is \\nﬁnanced by newly created money.

Private agents face strict \\nrules, they are screened, monitored, asked for collateral, and their loans are priced \\nproperly, whereas ﬁnancing the state by the central bank does not involve such scrutiny. If \\na private debt matures, in most cases, it has to be repaid, whereas a maturing public debt \\ncan easily be rolled over. \\nThe diﬀerences might be explained by the monopoly right to issue legal tender, a privilege \\nthe crown has given to the central bank. Holding the highest level of liabilities in the \\nmonetary hierarchy generates proﬁtable business for the central bank, which is lending \\nmoney to other banks facing liquidity shortage. A liquidity problem arises at the second \\nlevel of the banking system when too many customers want to withdraw money by either \\nhaving commercial bills discounted, or redeeming promissory notes or checking accounts \\ninto central bank notes, or when the bank is unable to settle at the end of the clearing \\nprocess. In all of these cases, a short-term liquidity loan from the central bank can solve \\nthe bank’s problem. As the central bank is the monopolistic supplier of legal tender notes, \\nit can charge high interest rates for these loans. (Remember, the central bank was \\nfounded by private businessmen, so originally and for a long time thereafter, it was a \\nproﬁt-seeking entity.)\\nPublic deﬁcit ﬁnanced by the central bank threatens this business by increasing the \\nquantity of banknotes in circulation and can lead to growing prices in the economy. \\nInﬂation is partially caused by the direct spending of the state, and partially by a credit \\nbubble generated by the loosening monetary conditions. As we have seen in the example \\nabout the checking accounts and the clearing system, 1 unit of central bank money can \\ngenerate transactions in multiple units of value. Consequently, an additional unit of \\nbanknote created by the central bank, spent by the state and deposited by an economic \\nagent in a bank, can generate multiple units of money on checking accounts. On the \\nbasis of the additional reserve, banks can lend more without having to worry about their \\nown liquidity. The macroeconomic demand is increased through two channels: both the \\nstate and private agents can ﬁnance their excessive spending by debt. The state spends \\ncentral bank money directly, private agents spend the money created by members of the \\nbanking system on the basis of the additional liquidity spent by the state. \\nIf macroeconomic supply cannot adapt to macroeconomic demand, prices start to \\nincrease. What private agents see in this situation is that the purchasing power of their \\nchecking accounts or banknotes is falling. As checking accounts are redeemable to \\nbanknotes, and banknotes are still convertible to gold coins, and the nominal gold \\ncontent of banknotes, so the price of gold is unchanged, more and more agents will turn \\ntheir balances at banks into banknotes, and banknotes at the central bank into gold \\ncoins. As banknotes are created, the possibility of converting deposits (checking \\naccounts) into banknotes is (with the help of the central bank) inﬁnite, however, as the \\ngold reserves of the central bank are ﬁnite, convertibility on the highest level of the \\nhierarchy sooner or later must be suspended. \\n\\t\\t \\x0023'),\n",

There are some diﬀerences, of \\ncourse. Central banks cannot ﬁnance the state directly anymore, although they can trade \\nwith treasury bonds on the secondary market, i.e. they can buy and sell treasuries that \\nhave been already issued. Instead of gold, the most important monetary reserves held by \\ncentral banks are key currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro or the British Pound. \\nConvertibility of national currencies is the possibility of exchanging them to other \\ncurrencies, especially to those listed above.\\nThe convertibility of the home currency to foreign currencies constrains the ease with \\nwhich the public deﬁcit and debt can be (re)ﬁnanced per se. Although technically the \\ncentral bank can still help serving the debt by creating money, as this money is \\nconvertible to foreign currency, the excessive debt can easily lead to a currency crises. \\nIndustrial and technological development has changed the payments and settlements \\nsystems. Economic agents holding deposit accounts in banks are using plastic cards \\ninstead of checkbooks. However, the essence of a payment between trading partners is \\nstill the parallel settlement . If “A” pays “B”  - except for the case when they are the \\ncostumers of the same bank - two payments are generated simultaneously . The account \\nof “A” is debited by his bank, and the account of “B” is credited by her bank; and parallel \\nwith this payment, central bank money ﬂows between the accounts of the two banks \\n(Figure 13).\\nThe transaction between “A” and “B” is successful if two conditions are fulﬁlled. First, the \\nbudget constraint is held, that is, “A” needs to have enough money on his account to pay \\nfor the goods or services provided by “B”. Second, the liquidity constraint is held, that is, \\n“A”’s bank needs to have enough central bank money on its account to pay “B”’s bank. \\nOn the international level, a single payment generally needs more than one liquidity conditions \\nto hold. If a Mexican supplier sells tequila to a Hungarian liquor-store, there are three parallel \\npayments: (1) the store pays the supplier, (2) the Hungarian commercial bank pays the Mexican \\ncommercial bank; (3) the Hungarian central bank pays the Mexican central bank.

These are the highest forms of liquidity as costumers can redeem their \\ndeposits into cash directly or into central bank accounts indirectly through the payments \\nsystem. Commercial banks can, and in most cases do, hold short-term treasury bills. T-\\nbills are liquid securities that can easily be sold on the interbank market or used as a \\ncollateral for an interbank loan or for a central bank loan. \\nTask: account for a liquidity loan on the interbank market!\\nThere is an important diﬀerence between borrowing money from another bank and \\nrequiring liquidity from the central bank. Banks can provide liquidity only to the extent of \\ntheir excess reserves, whereas the ability of the central bank to create reserves is \\ntheoretically inﬁnite. Because of this, the central bank is the ultimate liquidity backstop in \\nthe banking system, frequently called the lender of last resort. To avoid moral hazard \\nproblems – e. g. when banks do not care about their liquidity because the central bank \\ncan always help –, this role must be regulated. According to Bagehot’s Rules (Bagehot, \\n1873), named after Walter Bagehot, an English businessman of the 19th century, the \\ncentral bank should: \\n• provide liquidity freely (without hesitation) to solvent banks, \\n• at sound collateral, \\n• at a high interest rate. \\nLiquidity provision is important because a failure in the payments system could lead to a \\nchain reaction and to a full-ﬂedged systemic crisis. Banks and economic agents are \\ninterlocked through their balance sheets, so if “A” cannot pay to “B” because of a \\nliquidity shortage at “A”’s bank, then “B” cannot pay “C”, “C” cannot pay “D”, and so on. \\nHowever, it must be controlled for whether the bank has only mismanaged its short-term \\ncash ﬂows, i.e. it could not match cash (reserve) outﬂows with inﬂows temporarily, or it \\nhas an outstanding problem in the long run, i.e. it is insolvent. In the latter case, the bank \\nwill apply for liquidity again and again because its assets are worth less than its liabilities. \\nThe “sound collateral”, in most cases, consists of some government security, however, in \\na wider sense any good quality asset can be referred to by this term.

This is - typically - a loan between the members of \\nthe same level of the monetary system, where the money lent had been created by an \\ninstitution of some higher level before. A household, for example, can lend cash created \\nby the central bank or money from its bank account (created by a bank) to another \\nhousehold or to a company. A bank can lend money from its central bank account to \\nanother bank. Money-creating loans are provided between levels of the monetary system, \\ni.e. a bank can provide a loan by creating a bank deposit to a household or a company, or \\nthe central bank can grant a loan by creating a central bank deposit (or cash) to a bank. \\nMoney-redistributing and money-creating loans diﬀer technically: the former restructures \\nthe asset side of the creditor whereas the latter increases both the assets and the \\nliabilities of the creditor (Riesz, 1980). Another diﬀerence is that providing money-\\nredistributing loans is constrained by the amount of money the creditor has, while money-\\ncreating loans can be (technically) granted inﬁnitely. \\nFIGURE 15: PROVIDING A MONEY-REDISTRIBUTING LOAN. \\nMarkets to provide liquidity are created on several levels of the monetary system, by \\ndeﬁcit and surplus agents. Amounts paid for shipments in wholesale trade can be large \\nenough not to let them rest on suppliers’ accounts but to be tied up in the form of short-\\nterm deposits or short-term securities. Banks must be ready to provide solutions for \\nsurplus agents’ problems (i.e. excess liquidity) in the short run because, on the other \\nhand, deﬁcit agents (for instance, ﬁrms who have to ﬁnance their production before they \\ncould realise revenues from sales) apply for liquidity loans. When a loan is granted, money \\nis created and serves as the liquidity of the debtor. Thus, the bank does not lend out its \\nown reserves, but when the debtor spends this money, reserves are pumped out of the \\nbank. This liquidity, as mentioned above, can be re-borrowed on the interbank market, \\nhowever, it is better if it comes back indirectly or even does not leave the bank. If some \\ncostumer of Bank A deposits excess money balances in Bank B  then a reserve ﬂow \\nbetween the two banks is generated. In this wise, banks can compete for liquidity by \\ncreating attractive saving instruments. It is worth to emphasise that the subject of this \\ncompetition is not the deposit itself. Deposits are liabilities of banks, and who wants to be \\nliable? It is the additional liquidity – generated by the excess deposits – that the banks \\ncompete for,  so that they can lend more on its ground. \\nTask: account for a bank loan in the next two cases:\\n➡ ﬁrst, the business partner of the debtor is the costumer of another bank;\\n➡ second, the business partner of the debtor is the costumer of the same bank.\\nDebtor Creditor\\n+ Money + Loan - Money\\n+ Loan\\n\\t\\t \\x0027'),\n",

This ratio is not \\nstatic, it can be inﬂuenced by the business cycle or by events in the calendar year. In \\nrecessions, for example, economic agents keep more cash, thus banks need to increase \\ntheir reserves. Or around Christmas cash-usage is more frequent, making the banks once \\nagain keep more liquidity. Let alone these considerations, the supposed secure ratio of \\nliquidity reserves determines how much money banks can create by lending. This ratio is \\nwell below 1, which leads to money multiplication: if the central bank creates one unit of \\ncentral bank money  (which serves as the reserve of banks), then banks can create \\nmultiple units of deposits according to the secure reserve ratio . The following examples \\nshed light on money multiplication. \\nSuppose that Bank X calculates that the secure ratio between its reserves and deposits is \\n10%. If at the moment the bank has 100 units of reserves and 800 units of deposits, then it can \\ncreate by lending 200 more units of deposits without having to worry about liquidity problems. \\nSuppose that in the banking system the average of secure reserve ratios calculated by \\nindividual banks is 10%.

All \\nthese diﬀerences make it almost impossible to connect savers with investors directly.\\nThe loanable funds theory states that ﬁnancial intermediaries collect savings and fund \\ninvestments thereby connecting surplus agents with deﬁcit agents. It is easy to see, that \\nthere is a logical error in this claim if we want to apply it on the macroeconomic level. To \\nfund deﬁcit agents, the intermediaries - according to this theory - must collect the \\nsurpluses ﬁrst. However, the surpluses are the results of excessive spending of deﬁcit \\nagents, who cannot spend until they borrowed these surpluses. The intermediary cannot \\nlend something now that can be only collected later. \\nThe banking system that creates money provides solution both to the problem of \\nconnecting savers with investors and to this logical error. It is enough to take a look at the \\nbalance sheet of a bank to see how the funding problem is solved. The bulk of the loans \\ngranted by the bank are long term investment loans, whereas the bulk of the deposits are \\nsight deposits and time deposits maturing at most in one or two years. The bank \\nseparates the credit risk of the debtors from the liquidity risk of the depositors by holding \\ncapital reserves and liquidity reserves on the two sides of its balance sheet. In normal \\ncircumstances the expected liquidity loss and the expected capital loss are low, thus the \\nbank can keep the liquidity reserves to deposit ratio and the capital reserves to loans ratio \\naround 10-20% (see Figure 15).\\nFIGURE 15: THE BALANCE SHEET OF A TYPICAL BANK IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. \\nThe dynamics of this balance sheet are as follows. \\n➡ money creation by lending: loans and deposits increase \\n➡ destroying money when the loan is repaid: loans and deposits decrease \\n➡ realisation of credit risk: loans and capital decrease \\n➡ realisation of liquidity risk: deposits and liquidity decrease \\nBank\\nLiquidity reserves  10 Deposits                 85\\nLoans                    90 Capital reserves     15\\n\\t\\t \\x0030'),\n",

At that time banks \\nwere really condemned to passivity, so this name became widespread. Even today, the operations \\nthat modify the extent and composition of liabilities  – regardless of the fact that they express \\ndebts and liabilities – are called “passive” \\nDeposits \\nDeposits create the suitable liabilities for banks, which the credit and other income-generating \\nactivities are based on. The credit institutions’ own funds perform only security functions.\\nDeposits are distinguished according to the right of disposal:\\n• bearer deposit, \\n• registered deposits. \\nBearer deposit  are unanimous, the holder of the proper documents can dispose over the \\ndeposited amount. In case of registered deposits only the depositor and his/her representative \\nmay have disposal of registered deposits.\\nAccording to the currency of the deposit:\\n• in domestic currency, \\n• in foreign exchange, currency. \\nIn terms of repayment period:\\n• short (shorter than a year) term, \\n• medium- (between 1 and 5 years) term, \\n• long- (longer than 5 years) term.  \\nAccording to interests: \\n• ﬁxed, \\n• variable, \\n• convertible rate, \\n• formally non-interest bearing deposits. \\nWe talk about ﬁxed rates if during the repayment period the size of the interest rate is deﬁned in \\nadvance. In case of variable-rate deposits  the initial interest rate is bound to some kind of \\nreference rate (e.g. key interest rate) and the initial interest rate is changed during maturity only in \\ncase of its change. In case of variable-rate deposits the bank may change the initial interest rate \\nunilaterally under certain conditions . Formally non-interest bearing deposits are the discount \\nliabilities.\\nAccording to the maturity of deposits:\\n• demand deposit, \\n• deposits redeemable at notice, \\n• term deposit. \\nIn case of demand deposits, the depositor disposes of the account without any restrictions at \\nany time without loss of interest . The transfer of this amount is uncertain for the credit institution; \\ntherefore very low interest rate is paid on them. Deposits redeemable at notice  are transition \\nbetween demand deposits and term deposits. The client may terminate the deposit at any time \\nbut the credit institution has to aﬀect the order only after a certain time  (usually three days) \\ndepending on the contract. Term deposits cannot be withdrawn maturity, or only at the price of \\nlosing interest.\\n\\t\\t \\x0033'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='The payment account or simply bank account is used for the execution of payment transactions. \\nPayment accounts are on the liabilities side of the bank balance, just as deposits. However, while \\nin case of the deposit, the amount of the deposit is only for the disposal of funds (due to this fact \\nthe turnover of the deposit is small), the payment account is used for the transactions of the \\naccount holder.\\nIf this account the bank accomplishes overpayment in addition to the balance, i.e. grants credit to \\nthe client, the account is called current account. The size of the available credit which can be \\ntaken automatically, without a separate application, is usually a certain percentage of the account \\nbalance (relative limit) or a speciﬁc amount limit (absolute limit).\\nThe bank account management does not only mean booking incomes and expenses of the \\naccount merely, but a range of other related services are also included. For example, \\nmanagement of general ledger accounts, holding the disposal of the account holder credits \\ngranted on the current account, the so-called overdrafts, check and bill of exchange transactions, \\nmanagement of separate accounts, statistical report management for the monetary authorities, \\netc.\\nSo if the account management is not too promising to the banks, the expected opportunity of \\nconnected transactions makes this banking transaction attractive for them after all. The interest \\nbeneﬁt is added to this if the bank does not pay interest on the account balance. It mainly occurs \\nin countries with low inﬂation rate.\\nIssue of securities \\nBesides taking deposits, the emission of the bank’s own securities is a growing way of funds \\nraising. Issuing of short-term securities generally has a liquidity motive, therefore their majority \\nhas a maturity of 90, 180 and 270 days. Many varieties of short-term securities are known, such \\nas savings certiﬁcates, bills, etc. In general, they are ﬁxed rate ones, but rarely ﬂexible rate ones \\nalso occur. Interest payments are usually made at maturity, however, issuing on discount price is \\nalso known. Certiﬁcates of deposit bridge the gap between the short-term and long-term \\nsecurities. The aim is the acquisition of sources aiming at ﬁnancing permanent current assets with \\nthe emission of middle-term securities.\\nThe purpose of issuing long-term securities is ﬁnancing long-term investments. Its most \\nwidespread forms are bonds, savings certiﬁcates and letter of hypothecation.\\nThe savings certiﬁcate can be bearer or registered, ﬁxed or ﬂoating rate, or with bound \\ndenomination. In most cases, interest is paid at maturity, as compound interest. The savings \\ncertiﬁcate can be found in discount variations, as well. It is not possible to withdraw money from \\nthe note principal prior to the expiration.\\nThe letter of hypothecation is ﬁxed-rate security, of which coverage is created by lien on property. \\nIt makes possible to meet the lasting demand for credit of the agricultural and construction \\nindustries. Behind the letter of hypothecation there is therefore a land and real estate collateral, so \\nthe owner’s claim is insured not only by the repayment promise of the credit institution but also by \\nthe collateral.\\nThe great beneﬁt of securities emission is that if the investor needs his capital earlier than it was \\nexcepted, it is not needed to be redeemed at the issuing credit institution, but it can be sold in the \\nsecondary securities market. It can provide long-term resources for the credit institutions without \\nhaving to be afraid of repayment prematurely.\\nCentral bank loans \\nIf short- or long-term lack of resources arises at credit institutions, they can turn to the central \\nbank for a reﬁnancing loan. Banks can obtain collateralised loans only by depositing eligible \\nsecurities at the central bank. The owner of the securities is still the commercial bank, so the \\namount of credit received for it increases the balance sheet total. Central bank money enters the \\nasset side and there central bank credit (liabilities) enters the liability side.\\n\\t\\t \\x0034'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='The so-called repo transactions can be regarded as collateralised loans as well. Their essence is \\nthat the business bank sells eligible securities to the central bank and and agrees to repurchase \\nthem at a predetermined price at a predetermined future date. Thus the repo is the combination of \\na spot selling and a forward buying of the same security. The diﬀerence between the spot and the \\nfuture price reﬂects the repo rate. In case of a reverse repo the bank buys spot and sell forward \\nthe same securities.\\nIn case of rediscounting the central bank purchases bills discounted by banks earlier.\\nIn case of loans oﬀered beside foreign exchange coverage, the business bank takes out a loan in \\ndomestic cash equivalents to the amount of its foreign exchange deposit (which is its collateral at \\nthe central bank). Foreign exchange-swap  transaction can be mentioned here, when the \\nbusiness bank sells a kind of foreign exchange to the central bank for another particular foreign \\nexchange, and the business bank repurchases it simultaneously for a speciﬁc period, on a \\npredetermined rate. So, in practice, it means a spot purchase and a forward selling, or the other \\nway round, spot selling and forward purchase. T\\nInterbank borrowing \\nCompared to the corporate sector, the short-term liquidity in the banking sector should meet \\nmuch more severe requirements. Companies and individuals can be some days late with their \\ndues without a relatively greater risk, illiquidity of a bank can lead to a panic attack among \\ndepositors.\\nTherefore, banks often have to take intraday loans from each other in order to ensure their \\nliquidity. Interbank credits have some basic specialties  compared to the corporate credit market.\\nIn general, the vast majority of interbank loans is short-term: \\n• overnight loans , where the conclusion of the contract and taking out the loan \\nhappen on the same day, the repayment of the loan is a working day later.  \\n• tomnext (tomorrow-next), when the borrowing takes place one day after the \\nconclusion, and the loan repayment the day after  \\n• spotnext, where the granting of credit happens two days after the contract has \\nbeen made. \\nOf course, the participants of the interbank market may reach an agreement about any kinds of \\nconstructions. Thus, interbank loans actually have no time limit, but due to the high interest rates, \\nthey are mainly used in case of liquidity problems, for a few days duration.\\nThe second feature lies in the technique of contracting. While in case of corporate loans, literacy \\nhas an almost exclusive role, here oral agreements dominate, and technically it is followed by \\ncontracting written on-line, or by fax or other channels.\\nThe third particularity is that there is no insurance behind the interbank transactions. It is \\nexplained by the short duration of transactions and the conﬁdence of credit institutions in one \\nanother. Banks defend themselves against the risk by creating inner credit limits, in as much the \\nbank oﬀering the credit sets up limits, according to maturity types, based on the size of the \\npartner asking for credit, its reliability so far, its creditability, banking regulation, etc. The limits can \\nbe diﬀerent on the diﬀerent levels of bank management.\\nFinally, a special feature of the interbank market is that trends in interest rates are much more \\nerratic than in the corporate market. In case of tight liquidity market situation, since the borrower \\nhas to keep its liquidity in any case, a really high interest rate level may occur (of course its daily \\ninterest burden is bearable due to the short duration), while in broad liquidity periods the level of \\ninterbank interest rates may fall very low.\\nThe best-known international interbank interest rate is LIBOR (London Interbank Oﬀered Rate), \\nwhich is the interest rate provided for ﬁrst-class banks in the London interbank market. Its deposit \\nequivalent is LIBID. International loans are provided in LIBOR + risk premium type of \\n\\t\\t \\x0035'),\n",

In case of \\na direct loan the bank contracts its debtor and provides the contracted funds directly on the \\ndebtors account. In case of indirect loans the bank contracts with a third party, i.e. a mediatory \\nwho contracts with the ultimate user of the provided funds. \\nCredits are classiﬁed into three groups based upon their economic content.\\n➡ We talk about money credit  if the client obtains the amount of credit based on a credit \\napplication according to the classical rules of lending.\\nThe bank maintains a credit limit at the other party’s disposal for a commission Its essence \\nis that the debtor can take out the loan in whole or in parts, automatically, at any time at his \\nown discretion within a speciﬁc period. We talk about a loan if the client takes out a \\nspeciﬁed amount of money from his bank based on the loan contract, and he assumes an \\nobligation to pay it back together with interests.\\n➡ We talk about credit-like lending , if the bank grants credit not on the basis of credit \\napplication but due to any other legal relationship , for example joins in discounting bills of \\nexchange, factoring happens, etc.\\nA typical type of credit like loan is the commodity credit. The debtor selects the suitable \\nproduct, enters into the loan agreement (nowadays, in most of the cases it can be done at \\nthe place of purchase), and he can leave with the goods. The duration of the credit can be \\nshort-, medium- and long-term.\\n➡ In case of commitment credit the credit institution does not grant the amount immediately \\nbut only assumes an obligation that in the future it will fulﬁl its borrowing obligation under \\ncertain conditions . Such transactions are for example guarantee, letter of credit or credit \\navailability.\\nCredit types according to the character of the coverage:\\n• collateral loans, \\n• non collateral loans (blank credit). \\nWe talk about collateral loans if the ownership of any of the receiving party’s assets  (land, real \\nestate, equipments and even amounts on the debtor’s bank account) is transferred to the bank, in \\ncase the receiving party cannot repay the loan as agreed. Such lending has a relatively low risk, as \\nthe bank secures itself against non-payment. The bank has to value the collateral properly The \\ncredit is 100% covered if the value of the asset oﬀered as coverage is equal to the amount of the \\ndebt.\\nIn case a default a problem still can occur, if the bank cannot turn the asset into cash or at a lower \\nprice than the market value. Thus the bank usually applies a cut on the value of the collateral, and \\nprovides the loan accordingly. The Loan To Value (LTV) measure shows the ratio of the provided \\nloan to the value of the collateral.\\nIt is also conceivable, however, that the credit is only partially collateralised, i.e. the object \\npledged as collateral is worth less than the amount to be repaid. The bank is in the worst situation \\nwhen the credit is an uncovered credit, namely no asset is transferred to the ownership of the \\nbank if the debtor does not pay. Banks are trying to avoid the provision of these loans.\\nBanks have to face a wide range of risk with credits: the risk of changing interest rates or of \\neconomic conditions, non-payment, fraud, the debtor’s bankruptcy prospects, etc. They try to \\nreduce these risks somehow. As we have seen, one way to guard against the interest rates and \\neconomic conditions is that not ﬁxed but variable interest rates are applied.\\n\\t\\t \\x0036'),\n",

One of the solutions, as \\nwe have seen, the emission of only covered loans, when in case of non-payment the asset \\npledged as collateral is transferred to the ownership of the bank.\\nThe types of securities are as follows:\\n• security deposit, \\n• lien, \\n• suretyship, \\n• guarantee. \\nThe security deposit  is a form of ﬁnancial collateral s. If security deposit is oﬀered for the \\ninsurance of an obligation, the holder can satisfy his claim directly from the amount of security \\ndeposit in case of non-compliance or non-contractual compliance of the contract. The holder may \\nnot use the object of the security deposit, it has to be separated from his assets and it may be \\nused only for the purpose of satisfaction. If the contract signed for the underlying collateral are \\nfully satisﬁed, the security deposit is refunded to the obligor. The security can be marketable and \\nless marketable collateral.\\nAbsolute marketable: cash, government, banking securities, ﬁxed-term foreign exchange or \\ndeposits. Less marketable securities are: listed securities, bills of a ﬁrst-class debtor. \\nThe lien is a physical collateral. Its key objective is that the debtor should provide coverage to \\nsatisfy the deferred claims becoming due later, with property tied up in advance. If the debtor is \\nunable to repay his debt, the holder can secure his claim with the realisation of the pledge being \\nused to ensure the claims. Satisfying claims using the pledged item is usually based on a court \\ndecision, by way of compulsory execution. After completing the contractual obligations of the \\ndebtor, the lien on the pledged item is automatically terminated.\\nThe most common type of lien  is the mortgage. To create a mortgage, the pledge agreement is \\nrequired to be out down in writing and the mortgage is required to be received in a public register \\n(of mortgages). The subject of mortgage may be real estate, vehicles, and tangible assets. In case \\nof real estates, records are done by the Land Registry. The pledged property remains in the \\npossession of the owner, (s)he is intended to use all the while, but he has to ensure the \\npreservation. We know pledge, when the transfer of the pledge is also required in addition to the \\nmortgage contract. The transfer of the pledge can happen to a third person (chattel mortgage \\nholder)\\nIn case of suretyship, the surety is a person, who obliges to pay if the original debtor cannot.  If \\nthe principal obligation is not enforceable judicially, the surety cannot be enforced, either.\\nIn case of guarantee the bank pays a fee to the guarantor, who secures repayment of the loan if \\nthe original debtor defaults. The diﬀerence between the surety and the guarantor is that the former \\nis brought into the business by the the debtor. The guarantee is an independent obligation, which \\nmeans that it is a payment promise independent from the principal obligation. So it is indiﬀerent \\nwhy the obliged does not perform, the guarantee is obliged to accomplish if the obligor of the \\nunderlying transaction is innocent in the breach of contract.\\nThe price of loans \\n➡ The interest on loans is charged according to the speciﬁed annual interest rate. \\nThe types of interest rate have already been discussed in connection with passive \\nbanking operations. \\n➡ Potential nominal provision fee should be paid based on the unused amount of \\nthe credit limit. Its level is speciﬁed by the bank, usually on an annual basis up to \\n0-2%. \\n➡ Handling charge is a single one-time fee charged for credit assessment and binding \\nof contract. Its extent compared to the full amount of credit is 0-2%. \\n\\t\\t \\x0037'),\n",

It is generally a speciﬁc amount. \\n➡ The loan disbursement fee may be charged after signing the loan agreement, at \\nthe time of disbursing the loan. It is usually 0-2% of the loan amount. \\n➡ Banks charge an amendment fee in all cases when the client’s ﬁle has to be \\nhandled. \\n➡ In case of prepayment fee, the bank charges a commission for the client’s \\nunexpected cash ﬂow due to liquidity and interest risk. \\n➡ In case of guarantees and letters of credit, credit institutions charge annual fees \\nrather than interest rates. The extent is between 0-3%. \\n➡ The payment of risk taking commission occurs in case of purchasing the \\nreceivables (factoring), which reduces the amount of money paid to the customer. \\n➡ The bank may oblige the client to the payment of default interest if he does not \\nfulﬁl the current obligation in time. \\nThe indicator that includes all costs to be paid on capital  is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) . \\nThe APR is an internal rate which shows the real expense of the loan, in terms of present value \\ncalculation: it is an internal rate, in addition to which the repayable capital and lending fee is equal \\nto the sum of credit reduced by expenses paid by the client to the credit institution at the time of \\nthe liquidation. \\nSo the total charge is the amount to be paid by the borrower based on the credit agreement in \\naddition to the principal amount . Determining the interest rate and contributions of the credit is \\ncalled credit pricing. First, the base rate is determined, its parts are the cost of liabilities and \\ninterest margin. So the minimum credit interest to be paid by the client is the average (of the) \\ninterest rates paid for the bank’s liabilities (deposits, reﬁnancing, etc.) and the interest margin.

The process will be presented in a simpliﬁed way: based on the \\nassumption that money already exists in an economy, the following economic units can be \\ndistinguished:\\n• the state, \\n• companies and \\n• households. \\nAmong these economic units several transactions can take place on the goods and money \\nmarket.  Certain entities may spend more than their revenue (they are in deﬁcit) or may have more \\nrevenue than their planned expenditure (they have a surplus).\\nIn the absence of ﬁnancial intermediaries, at ﬁrst sight you would think that the units that have \\ndeﬁcit (borrowers) would pair with units that have surplus (lenders). However, some barriers can \\nbe identiﬁed: the needs of the borrowers and lenders may be incompatible and even if their needs \\ncan be matched, it may still be diﬃcult and expensive. These diﬃculties between the borrowers \\nand lenders can be bridged by ﬁnancial intermediaries.\\nFIGURE 1. MODERN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION \\nSource: Casu et al (2015) \\n\\u2028\\nFinancial intermediation obviously entails costs, but the costs are lower than those for individual \\neconomic entities to directly access each other. Financial intermediaries cover their costs and \\nproﬁts from interest rate spreads between loans and deposits.\\n4.2 The role of banks and the diﬀerent types of banking \\nThe main function of banks is to collect money (deposits) from units in surplus and lend money \\n(loans) to units in deﬁcit. Banks perform a transformation function, with regards to\\n• size (generally, the amounts needed by the borrowers exceed the amount the \\nlenders are willing to lend), \\n• maturity (generally, funds are lent for a short period of time into medium- or \\nlong-term loans), \\n\\t\\t \\x0039\\n'),\n",

Since banking and the banking system are \\nbased on trust, a bank failure might trigger a chain-reaction that – in extreme cases – might also \\njeopardise the stability of the banking system. There are several risks associated with banking \\nactivity. Table 3 provides an overview.\\nTABLE 3. OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN TYPES OF RISK. \\nInterest rate risk or interest risk is deﬁned as a negative eﬀect on the cash ﬂow of the bank from \\nchanging interest rates. Interest rate risk derives from the case, that the interest rate sensitivity of \\nthe bank’s assets and liabilities are diﬀerent. An asset (e.g.: loan) or a liability (e.g.: term deposit) is \\ninterest rate sensitive, if the pricing can change during a speciﬁed period. At the expiration of a \\nspeciﬁc asset or liability the environment might change and consequently the conditions of the \\nnew assets or liabilities also change.\\nFor example, if the bank is ﬁnancing a certain ﬁxed rate asset (e.g.: 5-year maturity, ﬁxed rate \\nmortgage loan) from a ﬂoating rate liability (e.g.: 1 year term deposit), after the expiration of the \\nliability, an increase in interest rates has an unfavourable outcome for the bank’s income. Interest \\nrate risk can be managed by synchronising the expiration time of the certain assets and liabilities. \\nThis means that the interest rate sensitive assets are ﬁnanced from interest rate sensitive \\nliabilities.\\nInterest rate risk can be measured by several methods.

Basic terms \\nFinancial assets or securities (unlike cars and houses) are intangible assets in the sense \\nthat their value does not depend on their physical characteristics. Moreover, in most of the \\ncases, they even do not have any physical attributes, since they are electronic, \\ndematerialised. (Some ﬁnancial assets, called certiﬁed securities, are issued in printed \\nform, but the value of these instruments has still no connection with the quality of the \\npaper or the ink.)\\nFinancial assets and securities are not precisely the same; the former term usually refers to a \\nbroader group. However, the legal deﬁnitions may vary by countries, and discussing these \\ndiﬀerences is beyond the scope of this book.\\nThe most important common feature of ﬁnancial assets is that they are claims and, at the \\nsame time, obligations on future cash ﬂows . (Here we refer to Chapter 2 where we \\nrecognised that ﬁnancial goods always appear in two balance sheets simultaneously: a \\nfuture cash ﬂow can be a claim for somebody only if it is an obligation for somebody \\nelse.) Hence, when determining the value of a ﬁnancial asset, we have to calculate the \\npresent value of its future cash ﬂows. This is why present value calculation is so important \\nin ﬁnance. We remark that these valuations might be very complicated, for two reasons. \\nFirst, the nominal sums of the future cash ﬂows are not necessarily determined in \\nadvance (e.g., dividends of a stock). Second, the appropriate rate for discounting might \\nbe hard to ﬁnd. \\nIt is worth to observe that not only ﬁnancial assets can be the subject of investment. We \\ncan invest our money in oil, paintings, real estate, and so on. A derivative contract (see \\nChapter 5.5) on oil is a ﬁnancial asset, but one barrel of Brent oil is not. \\nAs for the basic features of the claim embodied, we can talk about debt and equity \\ninstruments. Bonds and loans are typical examples of debt instruments ; t heir holders \\nrequire ﬁx payments (i.e., payments not depending on the economic performance of the \\nborrower) in return of lending funds. Equity instruments - common stocks, for example - \\npromise payments dependent on the earnings of the issuer and paid after all debt \\ninstrument holders are paid . Because of this, equity instruments are also called residual \\nclaims.\\nFinancial markets  are markets where ﬁnancial assets are issued and traded . Diﬀerent \\naspects might group these markets. According to the products traded, we can talk about \\ndebt, equity, derivatives, etc. markets. As for the tenor of the investments, we distinguish \\nbetween the money market and the capital market : the former is the market for short-\\nterm (i.e. shorter than 1 year) ﬁnancial assets, the latter is for long-term assets . The \\nprimary market  i s the expression for new issuances , while the secondary market  i s \\nwhere already issued assets are traded over . Finally, it is important to mention that the \\n\"place\" of the trading might be an exchange or the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) \\nmarket. Several securities are traded in both; moreover, some stocks are listed in more \\nexchanges at the same time.  \\n\\t\\t \\x0048'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content=\"5.2. Bond markets \\nBonds are debt instruments similar to loans: the issuer is the debtor, the investor or the \\nbuyer of the bond is the lender.  The issuer promises to pay the interest and the nominal \\nor face value of the security in the future . However, there are at least two signiﬁcant \\ndiﬀerences between loans and bonds. First, bonds are traded securities, which means \\nthat the 'lender' does not have to keep the asset until maturity, he can sell it on the \\nsecondary market. Second, the interest rate that the bond pays - also called coupon rate \\n- is not necessarily equal to the return expected by the investors. Because of this, the \\nloan amount that the issuer receives initially and that he pays back at maturity might be \\ndiﬀerent. \\nThe future cash ﬂows of a bond can be determined according to the following ﬁve \\nparameters: face value, coupon rate, interest payment period, principal payment \\nschedule, time to maturity. The face value (or nominal value) is the amount the issuer has \\nto pay back to the lender in the form of principal payments. The coupon rate of the bond \\nis always expressed as an annual percentage of the outstanding face value . If the interest \\npayment period is shorter than one year, we calculate the time-proportional interest \\nlinearly. The interests might be paid annually, semi-annually, quarterly, and so forth. In the \\ncase of government bonds, annual and semi-annual interest payments are the most \\nfrequent. The simplest and most usual principal payment schedule is when the entire face \\nvalue is paid in one sum, at maturity. In this case, we call the instrument bullet bond, \\nwhile in the case of more, partial principal payments, we call it amortising bond.\\nExample: cash ﬂows of 4-year bonds with diﬀerent cash ﬂow schemes \\nConsider four bonds: A, B, C and D. For all of them, the face value is 1,000 EUR, the coupon \\nrate is 4% and the time to maturity is 4 years. A, B and C pay interest annually, D pays semi-\\nannually. A and D are bullet bonds, B and C are amortising bonds. Bond B repays the face \\nvalue in two parts at the last two cash ﬂow dates, in 20-80% proportion. Bond C pays equal \\nprincipal payments during the 4 years.\\nTABLE 1: CASH FLOW SCHEMES OF 4-YEAR BONDS \\n*Year = the period that has to pass for the CF to be paid, expressed in years \\nIt is worth to mention that the coupon rate of a bond can be ﬁxed or ﬂoater. In the ﬁrst \\ncase, the coupon is constant over time and determined at issuance – this was the case in \\nthe previous example. Floater bonds pay interest that varies according to a reference rate. \\nThis reference rate is usually an interbank rate like Libor or Euribor.  In the case of ﬂoater \\nbonds, it is only the next cash ﬂow that we know in advance. \\nYear* A B C Year* D\\n1 40 40 290 0.5 20\\n2 40 40 280 1 20\\n3 40 240 270 1.5 20\\n4 1,040 832 260 2 20\\n2.5 20\\n3 20\\n3.5 20\\n4 1,020\\n\\t\\t \\x0049\"),\n",

At \\nissuance, the Libor is 3.0%, so the ﬁrst interest payment of the bond is ﬁxed at 3.0%\\n+0.3%=3.3%.  The second payment will be ﬁxed at the end of the ﬁrst year, and so on (see \\nTable 2). At maturity, the last coupon payment and the face value is paid as well. You can \\nobserve that the payments follow the market movements, which means that ﬂoater bonds bear \\nless interest rate risk than ﬁxed bonds. On the other hand, they carry cash ﬂow risk which is \\nexcluded in case of the ﬁxed securities. Hence, there is a trade-oﬀ between the two types of \\nrisk.  \\nTABLE 2: CASH FLOWS OF A 5-YEAR FLOATER BOND \\n*CF=cash ﬂow that the bond pays at the end of the given year (expressed in percentage \\nof the face value.) \\nFinally, we have to mention some special types of bonds, those with embedded options. \\nConvertible bonds give the right to the holder to exchange his bond to the stocks of the \\nissuer company. These are instruments half-way between debt and equity. Callable bonds \\ngrant the right to the issuer to “call back”, that is to repay the bond’s face value before \\nmaturity. In the case of putable bonds, the holder has the right to “give back” the \\ninstrument to the issuer, that is to enforce the redemption before maturity. In all of these \\ncases, the proper conditions of exercising the options must be determined in advance.  \\n5.3. Credit rating \\nThe most signiﬁcant issuers of bonds are central governments. Others are local \\ngovernments, ﬁnancial institutions, and companies.  Corporate bonds are more common \\nin the US than in Europe. \\nCentral governments issue bonds to ﬁnance their budget deﬁcit. In the US, the issuances \\nare organised by the Department of the Treasury. The most important types of securities \\nin this market are T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds. (T stands for Treasury.) T-bills are money \\nmarket instruments, with 12-month maturity at most. These securities do not pay any \\ninterest, so they have only one cash ﬂow: the face value at maturity. In case of positive \\ndiscount rates, their price is under their face value and vice versa. T-notes and T-bonds \\nare coupon-bearing instruments, with semi-annually interest payment period.  T-notes are \\nmedium-term assets, T-bonds are issued with at least 10 years of maturity. We may \\nobserve that in the case of the US Treasury securities, only the longest instruments are \\ncalled bonds. However, the economic and ﬁnancial sense of bills and notes are the same, \\nand they belong to the same broader class of ﬁnancial assets. It is quite general that the \\nmoney market securities of the central governments are zero-coupon instruments, and \\nthat they have a distinct name.\\nGovernment bonds are often called risk-free instruments, since governments (countries) \\ncannot go bankrupt. This is a very simplistic statement, for two reasons. First, we have to \\nYear CF* Libor\\n0 3.0%\\n1 3.3 2.5%\\n2 2.8 2.9%\\n3 3.2 2.5%\\n4 2.8 2.0%\\n5 102.3\\n\\t\\t \\x0050'),\n",

There are several other types of risk \\nthat a bondholder may take, the most important being the interest rate risk. Second, \\nsovereign defaults occurred more frequently and in more countries than one might think - \\nnot only in South America, not only after military coups, not only in foreign currency, not \\nonly with very high debt/GDP ratio. However, we admit that government bonds issued in \\nlocal currency are usually the safest investments within a country, concerning credit risk. \\nTABLE 3: THE CREDIT RATING CATEGORIES OF FITCH \\nSource: Fitch (2018)\\nCredit risk is a risk-type that is hard to measure. Specialised knowledge and expert is \\nneeded, and the data required for the calculations might not be available for every single \\ninvestor. That is why credit rating agencies specialised to this task. The most well-known \\nagencies are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings. \\nThey use alphabetical categories to assess the credit risk of a given issuer. The \\ncategories are similar, but not exactly the same at the diﬀerent agencies, see for example \\nthe grades of Fitch in Table 3. \\nWe may observe that the four best categories are called investment grades, while the \\nriskier ones are speculative – they are also called junk bonds. It is important to mention \\nthat the agencies are not prophets. Their ratings rely on sophisticated models, but these \\nare still only models subject to mistakes. \\nCategory Short description\\nInvestment \\ngrades\\nAAA Highest credit quality\\nAA Very high credit quality\\nA High credit quality\\nBBB Good credit quality\\nSpeculative \\ngrades\\nBB Speculative\\nB Highly speculative\\nCCC Substantial credit risk\\nCC Very high levels of credit risk\\nC Near default\\nRD Restricted default\\nD Default\\n\\t\\t \\x0051'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='5.4 Stock exchanges \\nThe below description of stock exchanges is based on how the Xetra trading system \\nworks. Xetra is an all-electronic trading system, which was originally developed in the \\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange, but has expanded to be used by various \\nstock\\xa0 exchanges\\xa0 throughout Europe, including Hungary. \\xa0 The trading system combines \\n“continuous trading” periods with “auction” periods. In the Budapest Stock Exchange \\nthere are “auctions” from 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and from 17:00-17:05 p.m. to collect the \\norders and after that in two minutes an algorithm knowing later determines the opening \\nand the closing price of the shares. But there could be midday auctions as well, which \\nenables liquidity to be concentrated in the middle of the day. \\nTo trade on the stock exchange the investor must open a securities account at a bank or \\nat a brokerage ﬁrm. Both securities and cash can be placed on this account. The balance \\nof the securities account is the value of the investor’s portfolio. Investors do not trade \\ndirectly with each other but through an intermediary who can be a dealer or a broker. \\nDealers have their own securities accounts, from where they sell securities at the ask \\nprice, and buy securities at the bid price. Thus their proﬁt is the diﬀerence between the \\ntwo prices, the so called bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread reﬂects the liquidity of the \\nsecurity: the more liquid a security is the narrower is the bid-ask spread. \\nBrokers do not have securities accounts, thus they do not trade on the stock market, \\ninstead they match the trade orders of investors. The most typical form of a trade order is \\nthe limit order, when the investor sets a price limit at which the given security can be \\nbought or sold. \\nA buy (or bid) order of price 80, size 120 can be interpreted as follows: the investor wants to \\nbuy 120 shares for 80 or cheaper. A sell (or ask) order of price 85, size 50 is an order, where the \\ninvestor wants to sell 50 shares for at least 85 per share.\\nLimit orders that have not been executed yet are collected in the order book. The trading \\ncan be continuous, in this case matching orders are executed immediately, thus the order \\nbook contains orders that cannot be matched, i.e. the best ask price is somewhat higher \\nthan the best bid price. (“Best” from the point of view of the other side.) \\nThe order book below (Table 1A) contains the prices at which orders were given in a \\ndescending order. There is a one dollar diﬀerence between the best ask price (45) and the best \\nbid price (44). These are the best prices because the cheapest price a share could be bought \\nfor is 45 at the moment, the highest price a share could be sold for is 44. \\nTABLE 1A: ORDER BOOK. \\nBID / ASK PRICE SIZE\\nASK 47 110\\nASK 46 45\\nASK 45 34\\nBID 44 78\\nBID 43 23\\nBID 42 81\\n\\t\\t \\x0052'),\n",

Every new order (except stop orders) placed in the central limit order \\nbook is immediately examined to see whether it can be executed against orders on the \\nother side of the order book. Depending on the price limit of the incoming orders and the \\norders in the order book, execution can be performed at diﬀerent prices.

Thus, the accumulation is top-down at the ask \\nside, and bottom-up at the bid side. Now, at each price the possible tradable amount can be \\ndetermined by taking the minimum of the appropriate cumulated bid and ask oﬀers. The price \\nat the end of the auction will be the one that maximises the traded quantity. \\nIn this example two prices (1385 and 1390) apply for this maximum principle. As the trading \\nsystem has to come up with only one price, a secondary optimisation is introduced over the \\nprices that maximise the traded quantity. The “winner” is the price where the oﬀered quantity \\nthat cannot be traded is minimal.\\nThe prices where the highest transacted amount (160 stocks) can be executed are 1385 and \\n1390. The better one of them is 1385 because at this price there is only 70 stocks which could \\nbe transacted (there are orders to buy them at this price) but there are no selling orders to pair \\nwith them. At the price of 1390 there would be orders for 90 stocks which cannot be realised.\\nTABLE 3B: THE ALGORITHM DETERMINING THE AUCTION PRICE. \\nThe secondary optimisation could happen in other ways as well. For example, we could strive \\nto achieve the higher price or the lower price movement. But the method of the Xetra trading \\nsystem follows the method above so the auction price will be 1385.

The \\nunderlying (asset) can be a share, a bond, some kind of commodity, foreign exchange, \\ninterest rate, a stock index, etc. Derivatives can be used for hedging and for speculation.\\nThere are three groups of derivatives: \\n• forwards,  \\n• options, \\n• swaps.  \\nThe forward contract is a mutual commitment of two parties to buy/sell the underlying at \\na speciﬁed price (F T) on some future date (T) . The future contracts are special type of \\nforward contracts traded on organised exchanges  known as futures market. The value of \\nthe forward at maturity depends on the value of the underlying (S T). The buyer of the \\nforward is in long position, that is (s)he gains proﬁt if \\x00 : (s)he pays for the underlying \\nthe forward price, and as (s)he can sell it immediately for the prevailing market price, the \\ndiﬀerence between the two prices is his/her proﬁt or loss. The seller is in short position, \\n(s)he gets the forward price and pays the market price. (See Figure 1 for graphical \\ndetails.) Thus the joint proﬁt of the two parties is always zero. This gives rise to pure cash \\nsettlement on the futures markets: the parties do not need to deliver the underlying asset \\nphysically, it is enough if the “looser” pays the appropriate amount (i.e. the absolute value \\nof the diﬀerence between the futures price and the market price at maturity) to the \\n“winner”.\\nIn the case of having a LF(K=500) and a SF(K=800) position with the same maturity (T) the \\ninvestor will have income of 300 at the maturity of the contracts. If the transaction costs of the \\ncontracts are lower than the present value of the 300, then the investor can get risk-free proﬁt \\nwhich means that there are discrepancies in the market creating the possibility of an arbitrage.\\nFutures contracts and markets have further specialties.

On the \\nfutures markets counterparties do not make the deal with each other. The clearing house \\nis an intermediary between buyers and sellers ensuring that the transaction happens as \\nplanned: the clearing house buys the underlying and pays the seller even if the buyer \\nrefuses to pay, and vice versa. The payable fee for this service is low because of the risk \\nmitigation by the margin accounts. Each investor agreeing the contract has a margin \\naccount to receive the proﬁt and pay the loss on a daily basis. The proﬁt (or loss) comes \\nfrom the one-day appreciation (or depreciation) of the future price. Because of this the \\nclearing house is on the hook for only the risk of one-day price movement. Moreover, \\ninvestors are required to have a deposit as well on that account which likely covers the \\none-day loss. If there is not enough fund on the account, the clearing house require the \\ninvestor to deposit additional funds (margin call). Finally, only an extremely volatile market \\ncan result in the loss for the clearing house.

These deals are personalized, OTC agreements. \\nThe two most common forms are interest rate and exchange rate swaps. In case of the \\nformer one party pays ﬁxed while the other pays ﬂoating interest rate on the same \\nnominal value. To avoid excessive transaction costs and risks, the payments are netted, \\nonly the diﬀerence is paid. \\nFor example, the A ﬁrm pays 4% ﬁxed interest to the B bank, while it pays EURIBOR +3,8% \\ninterest to the A ﬁrm under a swap contract with a face value of 15 million euros. The payments \\nare fulﬁlled annually. If the EURIBOR for the actual payment is -0,18%, then the bank must pay \\nthe ﬁrm 543.000 euro. Since this amount is higher than the ﬁxed interest (600.000 euro), after \\nnetting the payments the ﬁrm pays the bank 57.000 euro.\\nThe reason behind an interest rate swap is usually that the buyer of the swap can have \\ncheaper ﬁxed / ﬂoating rate loan, while businesswise it would be more beneﬁcial for it to \\nhave a ﬂoating / ﬁxed rate. With an interest rate swap however, it can achieve both goals. \\nFor example, if the movements of interest rates are indiﬀerent for the costs and incomes of a \\nﬁrm then the ﬁrm prefers to get ﬁxed interest loan otherwise the increase of the interest rate \\nincreases its costs as well diminishing the proﬁt while the incomes and the operating costs are \\nthe same. Getting a ﬁxed rate loan, the movements of the interest does  not aﬀect its proﬁt. In \\nthis case the ﬁrm gets a ﬂoating interest rate loan (if it’s cheaper) of 50 million euros and looks \\nfor a bank who is willing to contract an interest rate swap for the face value of 50 million euro. \\nBy this position the ﬁrm pays the bank the ﬁx interest, and the bank pays the ﬂoating interest \\nthe ﬁrm, which is equal to the interest of the loan.\\nIn case of an exchange rate swaps, the interest rate, the duration and the face value are \\nﬁxed, only the currencies are diﬀerent. Thus, the parties pay each other the interest in \\ndiﬀerent currencies in deﬁned timing. Netting is not evident in this case as the currencies \\nare diﬀerent.

The \\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) ﬁrst created a manual for reporting balance of \\npayments statistics in 1948. Since then, the IMF has been regularly updating the Balance \\nof Payments Manual  to respond to economic and ﬁnancial developments and the \\naccumulation of experience by compilers (IMF , 200)). Nowadays, the notions of the BoP \\nand the data reported accordingly are widely used in economic decision-making while \\nalso discussed and even challenged in the literature.        \\nThis chapter is structured as follows. In Section 1, the purpose of the BoP is described \\nwhile taking a ﬁrst glance at its overall structure. Section 2 introduces basic deﬁnitions \\nand principles necessary to compile the BoP of an economy. This is indeed what the \\nReader is going to do in an example (Section 4), after having studied the content of the \\nrows and columns step by step (Section 3). Finally, the chapter concludes with some \\nremarks on the interpretation and application of the BoP in economic analysis.        \\n6.1 Purpose of the BoP      \\nThe BoP summarises all economic transactions between residents (i.e. the domestic \\neconomy) and non-residents (i.e. foreign economies) for a period of time.  It does so in a \\nstructured way, with standard rules for the content and entry of data. Figure 1 shows the \\nmain structure of the BoP . Section 3 is going to describe each component in detail. Here, \\nit is enough to note that the table is split into two main parts (horizontally): there is a real \\neconomic (I-II) and a ﬁnancial block (III-IV). \\nThis splitting is important because it reveals a more profound purpose of the BoP . By \\ncollecting all foreign transactions, it actually aims to determine the domestic economy’s \\nnet external position, arising from real economic links. As economies trade in goods and \\nservices and provide means of production (labour, capital) to each other (with incomes \\nsent and received), deﬁcits and surpluses are likely to arise. This means either foreign \\nborrowing (i.e. getting ﬁnanced by other economies, in case of a deﬁcit) or foreign lending \\n(in case of a surplus) in net terms in a given period. Thanks to the ﬁnancial block, the BoP \\nalso shows the ﬁnancial transactions underlying the net foreign borrowing or lending. The \\nnet external position is further discussed in Section 3. At this point, the Reader should \\nnote that the BoP includes important information on an economy’s international ﬁnancing \\npatterns.   \\n\\t\\t \\x0062'),\n",

That is, \\none can look at the BoP of the U.S. or China or Russia etc. Transactions are recorded vis-\\ná-vis the rest of the world. It follows from the foregoing that notions with bilateral \\nrelevance, e.g. exports, imports, claims and liabilities refer to those of  the domestic \\neconomy. \\nResidents are the actors (households, ﬁrms, non-governmental organisations [NGOs] and \\nthe government) of the domestic economy. This is an exhaustive deﬁnition only at the ﬁrst \\nglance, though, as the international mobility of people and entities raises questions about \\nwhat the attribute “domestic” really means.

The case of c) is just the reverse, this ﬁrm operates in the U.S. and therefore, it \\nis resident there. \\nTransactions between residents and non-residents are recorded in the BoP on the basis \\nof the following principles: \\n• Transactions at market value: Transactions are accounted for at market prices \\neven if partners agree otherwise.   \\n• Accrual principle: Transactions are included if and when agreed on by partners, \\nnot when payed.  \\n• Double-entry accounting of the transaction value : Each transaction involves \\na credit entry and a debit entry (see columns of the BoP in Figure 1). In most \\ncases, this seems logical as transactions are usually exchanges, i.e. two-sided. \\nThere may be a real and a ﬁnancial “side” (e.g. selling a product in exchange for \\nmoney), or there are purely ﬁnancial exchanges (e.g. taking out a bank loan, \\nbuying a share). However, in case of transfers, the double-entry accounting \\nseems unjustiﬁed as transfers are unilateral transactions by deﬁnition (e.g. \\nproviding food aid does not result in any obligations on the part of the recipient). \\nNonetheless, this problem is solved by having extra rows for transfers.

The reason is that these terms are interpreted slightly diﬀerently in \\nthe diﬀerent parts of the BoP . So generally, it can be stated that values in credit increase \\nthe balances of the parts of the BoP while values in debit decrease them.  This is so \\nbecause net value of each row is calculated as credit – debit . By summing up all net \\nvalues of a part, we get the corresponding aggregate balance (CA, FA, KA, dRes). (The \\nsame result is obtained by summing up all credits and debits of a part separately and \\nsubtracting the latter.) \\nStill in general, credit could be loosely labelled as “revenue/inﬂow” and debit as \\n“expenditure/outﬂow”. Figure 2 points out the accurate meanings which become clear \\nonce having studied the contents of the horizontal parts. \\nAs mentioned earlier, the BoP consists of two main horizontal blocks (separated by the \\ndashed line in Figure 2). Into the ﬁrst block  (I-II), the real economic components of \\ntransactions are entered. Throughout this block, values are accounted for in the credit \\ncolumn if the domestic economy obtains revenue or income in the transaction  in \\nquestion. Debit includes the reverse, i.e. expenditure or the outﬂow of income . This \\nhorizontal block is further split into the current account and the capital account. \\nThe current account (CA) shows ﬂows of goods and services (trade) and ﬂow of incomes \\nand current transfers. Particularly, the following rows and contents appear here:\\nGoods: This row covers the international trade of products. Export of goods brings \\nabout revenues for the domestic economy, so it is entered as credit. Conversely, \\nimports are accounted for as debits.  \\n\\t\\t \\x0065'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pfi-briefings.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='Services: This row covers the international trade of services. Credits and debits in this \\nrow are interpreted in the same way as in “Goods”.  \\nIncomes: In this row, the international ﬂow of incomes of means of production (labour, \\ncapital) is accounted for. These incomes are obtained either by workers or by holders of \\nﬁnancial or other non-produced assets who provide/rent these for foreign actors. \\nPractically, this row contains salaries and wages, rents, interest incomes and dividends \\nsent and received. If received by the domestic economy, these are entered into the \\ncredit column. Debit includes incomes sent abroad.  \\nCompensation of workers appears in this row only if the employer and the employee are \\nresident in diﬀerent countries. That is the case of workers who work in a foreign economy \\nfor less than one year as they are still residents of their economy of origin while getting \\ncompensation from a non-resident (a foreign employer). Staying at least one year abroad, \\nthese workers themselves become non-resident, though. Consequently, their \\ncompensation appears in the BoP only if they decide to send it home. If so, this amount is \\nnot regarded as an income any more, but as a (current) transfer because it is unilaterally \\nprovided to the home economy.   \\nCurrent transfers: The purpose of this row is to account for a certain type of unilateral \\ntransactions. Transfers are considered as “current” if they directly aﬀect the level of \\ndisposable income (and hence, consumption possibilities). (By contrast, capital \\ntransfers included in the capital account aﬀect the level of wealth.) Typical examples of \\ncurrent transfers are aides, taxes on income and wealth and social contributions and \\nsocial beneﬁts (e.g. pensions). Moreover, membership fees paid to international \\norganisations are also entered as current transfers. If received by residents, transfers \\nare regarded as credit. Conversely, transfers provided by residents to non-residents are \\ndebits.               \\nThe aggregate balance of these rows is known as the current account balance (also \\ndenoted by CA).   \\nThe capital account (KA) includes the following:\\nNon-produced, non-ﬁnancial assets: The term “non-produced, non-ﬁnancial assets” \\nrefers to natural resources and rights to utilise them (e.g. land, mines/mining rights, \\nradio spectra); permissions to undertake speciﬁc activities; and patents, copyrights, \\ntrademarks, brand names and franchising. The BoP includes transactions of these \\nassets. Entries follow the same logic as in the ﬁrst two rows of the current account. If \\nresidents sell non-produced, non-ﬁnancial assets to non-residents, the transaction \\nvalue is entered as credit (revenue to the domestic economy). If such assets are, on the \\ncontrary, bought by residents (expenditure), debits appear in the BoP . \\nCapital transfers:  Here, the description of “Current transfers” applies except that \\ncapital transfers aﬀect wealth.   \\nThe aggregate balance of these rows is known as the capital account balance (also \\ndenoted by KA).   \\nThe sum of the balances of the current and capital accounts (CA + KA)  deﬁnes the net \\nexternal position of the domestic economy , i.e. whether it needs foreign ﬁnancing or is \\nable to ﬁnance foreign economies as an outcome of its provision and use of real \\neconomic resources in a given period. To put it diﬀerently, the domestic economy may run \\nan external deﬁcit (net borrowing) or an external surplus (net lending). As all values in the \\nBoP , the net external position is a ﬂow indicator, capturing changes in a stock. An \\nexternal deﬁcit (in itself) increases the liabilities of the domestic economy vis-á-vis the \\n\\t\\t \\x0066'),\n",

Conversely, an external surplus (in itself) results \\nin an increase of its claims (or the decrease in its liabilities).    \\nThe stock in question is most precisely the net international investment position (NIIP)  \\nwhich is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the foreign liabilities and claims of the domestic \\neconomy. At the start of a period, the domestic economy can have either net liabilities or net \\nclaims which is changed by the net external position recorded in the BoP for that period. It \\nmust be noted, however, that the change of the NIIP is not exclusively driven by the net \\nexternal position. Revaluations, i.e. changes in prices of assets and exchange rates also aﬀect \\nits value. Consequently, an economy running an external deﬁcit may indeed end up with \\n(higher) net claims if its assets appreciate in the meantime. While revaluations can have \\nparticularly important eﬀects in the short run, Obstfeld (2012) nevertheless concludes that \\nregarding long-term patterns, the NIIP is driven primarily by the net external position. (See \\nThe net external position is conceptually equal to the balance of the ﬁnancial account and \\nthe change of reserves (FA + dRES). In other words, the second block of the BoP (III-IV) \\nshows how the net borrowing from or the net lending to non-residents is ﬁnanced  as it \\nreveals the various foreign ﬁnancial transactions in a given period. The ﬁnancial account \\n(FA) records the following:\\nDirect investment: Also referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI), this type of \\ncross-border investment arises when an investor acquires signiﬁcant degree of \\ninﬂuence on the management of an enterprise resident in another economy. According \\nto the IMF’s BoP standards, there is a signiﬁcant degree of inﬂuence if the investor \\nobtains equity giving it voting power of at least 10 percent in the enterprise. If a non-\\nresident invests in a resident ﬁrm, this is entered in the BoP as credit because the \\nliabilities of the domestic economy increase. If residents invest abroad, that is precisely \\nthe reverse (increase of claims) and consequently, debit.  \\nOwning equity in a ﬁrm gives rise to claims on that ﬁrm. (The best-known signs of that are \\ndividends which, however, trace back to the very fact that the owner has invested part of its \\nwealth into that company. This shareholding appears as an asset in the owner’s balance \\nsheet.)  \\nPortfolio investment:  Portfolio investment involves trading ﬁnancial assets without \\nacquiring signiﬁcant degree of inﬂuence on an enterprise (if this were possible at all). \\nTrade of shares, bonds and other securities is accounted for in this row. Credits and \\ndebits are interpreted in the same way as in “Direct investment”. Investors involved in \\nportfolio investment can be mostly regarded as ﬁnancial investors striving for exchange \\nrate gains. By contrast, direct investors are more likely to be strategic investors having \\nlong-term interests in the speciﬁc business (industry). \\nOther investment: Other investments include, among others, bank loans and trade \\ncredits. Credits and debits are interpreted analogously as in the previous two items, \\nwith residents taking out loans as credit (increase of liabilities) and granting loans as \\ndebit (increase of claims).  \\nTaking a simple approach, reserves cover the currency stock of the domestic economy. \\nMore precisely, reserves refer to monetary gold and foreign currency (FX) assets held by \\nmonetary authorities (central banks) to meet balance of payments ﬁnancing needs  \\n(besides other purposes). Here, for simplicity, we assume that all international (FX) \\npayments involve central banks (or less restrictively, that currency is deposited within the \\ndomestic two-tier banking system, “channelling” to the central bank).

If the domestic economy obtains currency \\n(e.g. export revenue), the value is entered into the debit column. Currency outﬂow (e.g. \\npayment for imports) is accounted for as credit. This is consistent with the interpretations \\nof credit and debit in Figure 2 as a currency is a claim of the domestic economy. It is easy \\nto see that residents with currency “in their pockets” can anytime decide to purchase \\ngoods, services etc. from abroad.

The purpose of \\nthe BoP is to summarise all economic transactions between residents and non-residents \\nfor a period of time. A key notion of the BoP is the net external position which is the \\nbalance of the real economic transactions recorded. Although the net external position is \\nan important marker of changes to external indebtedness, the net approach in itself is not \\nsuﬃcient to uncover all relevant ﬁnancing patterns . It is apparent from the BoP compiled \\nin the example in Section 4 that gross ﬂows are much bigger than the net external \\nposition. This is of particular relevance in the case of the ﬁnancial block of the BoP . In a \\nworld of huge global capital ﬂows and complex ﬁnancial links, stability concerns may well \\narise from ﬁnancial transactions mostly appearing only in the ﬁnancial block.\\nNote that purely ﬁnancial transactions appear only in the ﬁnancial account and the row \\n„change of reserves”, but not in their ﬁnal (net) balance as they cancel out when calculating it. \\nExamples are transactions 5), 6) and 10) in Section 4.\\nAttention to gross values is also vindicated by the related fact that claims (resulting from \\nsurpluses) of some domestic actors are not directly available to settle the liabilities of \\nothers. So even if the domestic economy runs large external surpluses and hence, \\naccumulates huge foreign claims in net terms, there are possibly actors who are \\n(externally) indebted. If these debts happen to be unsustainable for whatever reason, a \\ndebt crisis may erupt due to spill-over eﬀects. \\nHowever, the importance of the gross approach does not annul the relevance of the net \\nexternal position in economic analysis. Sustained net patterns may signal underlying \\ndisturbances, “imbalances” in an economy or a group of economies. Recurrent external \\ndeﬁcits and countervailing surpluses may thus provide early warning of crises, e.g. \\ninternational debt crises. Empirical evidence shows that external positions had become \\nincreasingly polarised in the case of the U.S. and China and within the euro area before \\nthe 2008 crisis.\\nIn case of emerging economies, catching up usually involves external deﬁcits for several \\nconsecutive periods as advanced technologies can possibly be accessed only from abroad, or \\nto put it diﬀerently, there is no suﬃcient internal capacity to invest. If external ﬁnancing is really \\nused to achieve higher competitiveness (boosting export revenues to repay debts), there is no \\nthreat of unsustainability. It is hard, however, to come clear on this in advance. \\n\\t\\t \\x0070'),\n",

This is the \\nlargest ﬁnancial market: with a global trading of 7/24, the total amount of FX traded daily is about \\n5 trillion USD. The global trading of currencies is the fundamental of international economic \\nrelations, and therefore a key variable for the economic policy as well. \\nThis is a meeting point between many participants of the economy. Firms engaged to \\ninternational trade are exposed to the movements of exchange rates. Importers of goods are \\nhaving expenses in foreign currencies and revenues in the domestic currency; exporters are \\nhaving revenues in foreign and expenses in the local currency. However, usually they do not \\nchange their exposure directly, but seek the adequate liquidity on the global market, usually via \\nbanks and other institutions. FX-risk management provides hedge against volatile exchange rate \\nmovements. Some participants take this risk on their balance sheets for proﬁt seeking reasons \\nthus providing hedge to those who want to get relieved of their exposure. \\n“Key currencies” are the currencies of the major economies. The US Dollar (USD) is called the \\n‘world currency’, the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Japanese yen (JPY) are the most \\ntraded currencies besides the US dollar. Other currency pairs, such as Hungarian Forint  (HUF) / \\nSouth African rand (ZAR) cannot be traded directly, but usually via key currencies. \\nA foreign exchange quotation  (or quote) i s a statement of willingness to buy or sell at an \\nannounced rate . The CUR1/CUR2 quotation may seem a bit confusing or non-intuitive. The \\ncurrency to the left of the slash is called the base currency or the unit currency. The currency to \\nthe right of the slash is called the price currency or quote currency. The quotation always \\nindicates the number of units of the price currency, CUR2, required in exchange for receiving one \\nunit of the base currency, CUR1. \\nFor example, the most commonly quoted currency exchange is that between the US dollar and \\nthe euro. The quotation EUR / USD 1.2174 designates the euro (EUR) as the base currency, the \\ndollar (USD) as the price currency, and the exchange rate is USD 1.2174 = EUR 1.00. \\nA direct quote is the price of a foreign currency in domestic currency units . An indirect quote is \\nthe price of the domestic currency in foreign currency units . In retail exchange in many countries \\n(such as currency exchanged in hotels or airports), it is a common practice to quote the home \\ncurrency as the price and the foreign currency as the unit. \\nA woman walking down the Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris might see the following \\nquote: EUR 0.8214 / USD 1.00 Since in France the home currency is the euro (the price) and the \\nforeign currency is the dollar (the unit), in Paris this quotation is a direct quote on the dollar or a \\nprice quote on the dollar. Verbally, she might say to herself, “0.8214 euros per dollar,” or “it will \\ncost me 0.8214 euros to get one dollar.” These are European terms. \\nAt the same time a man walking down Broadway in New York City may see the following quote \\nin a bank window: USD 1.2174 /  EUR 1.00 Since in the US the home currency is the dollar (the \\nprice) and the foreign currency is the euro (the unit), in New York this would be a direct quote \\non the euro (the home currency price of one unit of foreign currency) and an indirect quote on \\nthe dollar (the foreign currency price of one unit of home currency).

Dealers bid (buy) at \\none price and ask (sell) at a slightly higher price, making their proﬁt from the spread between the \\nprices. The bid-ask spread may be quite large for currencies that are traded infrequently, in small \\nvolumes, or both.

To avoid ambiguity the market \\nis observed from a domestic point of view. Demand and supply of foreign currencies can be \\nconnected to the international transactions of the home economy. Imports of goods and services \\nand exports of capital generate FX demand, while exports of goods and services and imports of \\ncapital generate supply. \\nIf a Hungarian company buys foreign goods - for example Swedish furniture - it has to buy \\nforeign exchange ﬁrst: import of goods \\x00  FX demand\\nIf an investor who has HUF-denominated assets in Hungary - for example a bank deposit - \\nwants to reallocate his portfolio by investing in American treasuries, has to buy US dollar ﬁrst: \\nexport of capital \\x00  FX demand\\nIf a Hungarian manufacturer sells her product to a French merchandise retailer and is paid in \\neuros, the she has to sell the euros for Forints, because she pays salaries, taxes, her domestic \\nsuppliers in Forint: export of goods \\x00  FX supply\\nIf German investors want to buy shares on the Budapest Stock Exchange, they have to sell \\neuros for forint: import of capital \\x00  FX supply\\nThe market is in equilibrium when the quantity of foreign currency demanded equals the quantity \\nsupplied (Figure 1). If export of goods or import of capital increases, the supply curve shifts to the \\nright, and the equilibrium exchange rate decreases (Figure 2, left hand panel). This is called the \\nappreciation of the home currency (or the depreciation of the foreign currency). An increase of \\nimport of goods or of export of capital shifts the demand curve right, and the home currency \\ndepreciates (Figure 2, right hand panel). \\nFIGURE 1: THE FX MARKET. \\n→\\n→\\n→\\n→\\n\\t\\t \\x0073\\nquantity of foreign exchange\\nS(upply)\\nD(emand)\\nexchange rate'),\n",

If two countries produce an identical good, and transportation costs and trade \\nbarriers are very low, or non-existing the price of the good should be the same throughout the \\nworld no matter which country produces it. One of the most prominent theories of how exchange \\nrates are determined is the theory of purchasing power parity (PPP). It states that exchange rate \\nbetween any two currencies will adjust to reﬂect changes in the price levels of the two countries . \\nThe theory of PPP is simply an application of the law of one price to national price levels.\\nSuppose that German steel costs 100 euro per ton and Japanese steel with the same quality \\ncosts 10,000 yen per ton. For the law of one price to hold, the exchange rate between the yen \\nand the euro must be 100 yen per euro (€0.01 per yen), so that one ton of German steel sells \\nfor 10,000 yen in Japan (the price of Japanese steel) and one ton of Japanese steel sells for \\n€100 in Germany. If the exchange rate were 200 yen to the euro, Japanese steel would sell for \\n€50 per ton in Germany or half the price of German steel, and German steel would sell for \\n20,000 yen per ton in Japan, twice the price of Japanese steel. This situation generates excess \\ndemand for the Japanese steel, excess supply of the German steel and a demand for the yen \\n(as German companies buy yen for euro). As a result, the price of Japanese steel increases, the \\nprice of German steel decreases, and the EUR/YPN exchange rate decreases (the yen \\nappreciates) until the exchange rate equals the ratio of the two prices.\\nApplying the law of one price to the price levels in the two countries produces the theory of  \\npurchasing power parity, which claims that if the Japanese price level rises 10% relative to the \\nEurozone price level, the euro will appreciate by 10%. As our example illustrates, the theory of \\nPPP suggests that if a country’s price level rises relative to another’s, its currency should \\ndepreciate (the other currency should appreciate). Another way of thinking about purchasing \\npower parity is through a concept called the real exchange rate , the rate at which domestic \\ngoods can be exchanged for foreign goods . In eﬀect, it is the price of domestic goods relative to \\nthe price of foreign goods denominated in the domestic currency. \\nIf a basket of goods in New York costs $50, while the cost of the same basket of goods in \\nTokyo costs $75 because it costs 7,500 yen while the exchange rate is at 100 yen per dollar, \\nthen the real exchange rate is 0.66 (= $50/$75). The real exchange rate is below 1.0, indicating \\nthat it is cheaper to buy the basket of goods in the United States than in Japan. \\nThe real exchange rate indicates whether a currency is relatively cheap or not. Another way of \\ndescribing the theory of PPP is to say that it predicts that the real exchange rate is always equal \\n\\t\\t \\x0074\\nq\\nS\\nD\\ne\\nS’\\nq\\nS\\nD\\ne\\nD’'),\n",

From 1973 to 2013, the British \\nprice level rose 102% relative to the U.S. price level, and as the theory of PPP predicts, the dollar \\nappreciated against sterling, though by 60%, an amount smaller than the 102% increase \\npredicted by PPP . Yet, as the same ﬁgure indicates, PPP theory often has little predictive power in \\nthe short run. From early 1985 to the end of 1987, for example, the British price level rose relative \\nto that of the United States. Instead of appreciating, as PPP theory predicts, the U.S. dollar \\nactually depreciated by 40% against the pound. So even though PPP theory provides some \\nguidance to the long-run movement of exchange rates, it is not perfect and in the short run it is a \\nparticularly poor predictor. What explains PPP theory’s failure to predict well? The PPP conclusion \\nthat exchange rates are determined solely by changes in relative price levels rests on the \\nassumption that all goods are identical in both countries and that transportation costs and trade \\nbarriers are very low. When this assumption is true, the law of one price states that the relative \\nprices of all of these goods (that is, the relative price level between the two countries) will \\ndetermine the exchange rate. The assumption that goods are identical may not be too \\nunreasonable for German and Japanese steel, but is it a reasonable assumption for American and \\nJapanese cars? Is a Toyota the equivalent of a Chevrolet? Because Toyotas and Chevys are \\nobviously not identical, their prices do not have to be equal. Toyotas can be more expensive \\nrelative to Chevys and both Americans and Japanese will still purchase Toyotas. Because the law \\nof one price does not hold for all goods, a rise in the price of Toyotas relative to Chevys will not \\nnecessarily mean that the yen must depreciate by the amount of the relative price increase of \\nToyotas over Chevys.\\nFurthermore, PPP theory does not take into account that many goods and services (whose prices \\nare included in a measure of a country’s price level) are not traded across borders. Housing, land, \\nand services such as restaurant meals, haircuts, and golf lessons are not traded goods. So even \\nthough the prices of these items might rise and lead to a higher price level relative to another \\ncountry’s, the exchange rate would experience little direct eﬀect. As empirical studies ﬁnd PPP \\ncan hardly explain the change of exchange rate, so it is not suitable for forecasting or operative \\ndecision making. \\nIn the short-run exchange rates are determined by capital ﬂows. With free capital mobility \\ninvestors (re)-optimise their portfolios according to changes in expected returns and risks. \\nSuppose that there are two portfolios, the home portfolio (H) and the foreign portfolio (F) \\ncharacterised by the \\x00  and \\x00  expected return - risk pairs respectively. Assuming that \\ninvestors are risk-averse, a change in either of the four elements leads to a shift in portfolio \\nweights. If the return of the home portfolio increases, investors reallocate their investments \\ntowards the home country, thereby appreciating the home currency. A decrease of the risk of the \\nhome portfolio leads to the same result. These are the cases of capital import from a domestic \\npoint of view. Capital export and thereby depreciation can be triggered by either a decrease of the \\n\\x00  diﬀerence or by an increase of the \\x00  diﬀerence. \\n7.4 Exchange-rate systems \\nNormally, the trend of the exchange rate is determined by the fundamentals of the economy. The \\nreal appreciation of the home currency in the long rung is the mirror image of a higher potential \\ngrowth rate of the home economy. However, capital movements triggered by the changes of \\ninvestors return-risk perceptions can divert the exchange rate from its long-run trend. Though \\nthey are temporary, these diversions can cost economic agents a lot. \\n(rH, σH) (rF, σF)\\n(rH − rF) (σH − σF)\\n\\t\\t \\x0075'),\n",

Both the import and the export are settled in euro.

However, by the time it ﬁnishes manufacturing and sells the product, the \\nForint has appreciated by 5 percent, thus the rate at which the company can sell the euros \\nreceived for the export is 304 EUR/HUF . If the competition is ﬁerce in the industry, this change \\ncan turn the company’s proﬁt into a loss. \\nThe higher the openness - measured by the total value of exports and imports relative to the GDP  \\n- of an economy is, the more sensitive its performance is to exchange rate movements. Especially \\nin small open economies the exchange rate is the most important element of the price system. \\nTherefore economic policies have to deﬁne their relation to the exchange rate by determining an \\nexchange rate regime.\\nThe exchange rate regime is called ﬂoating when market demand and supply determines the FX \\nrate without any central bank intervention. The central bank can inﬂuence the exchange rate both \\nas a market participant and both as an authority. In the ﬁrst case it sell (buys) foreign currency if it \\nwants to strengthen (weaken) the home currency. As an authority the central bank can restrict \\nconvertibility by imposing barriers to currency exchange. In formal terms a central bank \\nintervention shifts either the demand or the supply curve to the right, restricting convertibility \\nshifts these curves to the left. \\nIn a ﬁxed exchange rate system , exchange rates are either held constant or allowed to ﬂuctuate \\nonly within an explicit band. In general, the central bank must oﬀset any imbalance between \\ndemand and supply conditions for its currency in order to prevent its value from changing. \\nIn 2001 the Hungarian central bank introduced a ﬁxed exchange rate regime with a \\x00\\nband. The centrum of this band was 286 EUR/HUF the weak and the strong edges were 324 \\nHUF/EUR and 240 HUF/EUR respectively. Market forces could freely determine the exchange \\nbetween these two values. However whenever the exchange rate reached the weak (strong) \\nedge the central bank had to sell (buy) euros to keep the exchange rate within the band. \\nCentral banks can strengthen the home currency to the extent of their foreign reserves. Buying FX \\nis not technically constrained, because the central bank creates the home currency. However, as \\nmoney creation can threaten the central bank’s inﬂation target (see Chapter 2), sooner or later \\nintervention has to be suspended. \\nWhen the central bank bank bumps into one of these constraints, it can either reset or exit the \\nexchange rate regime. Reseting means that the parameters of the band are changed. In case of a \\nweakening home currency and insuﬃcient FX reserves the central bank devalues the home \\ncurrency by setting the centrum of the band higher . Devaluation is a legal act, an oﬃcial \\nadmission that the home currency was overvalued before. In case of appreciation and fear of \\ninﬂation the central bank revalues the home currency by setting the centrum of the band lower. A \\nthird case of reseting the ﬁxed exchange rate regime is broadening the band.\\nIn February 2008 a massive capital inﬂow appreciated the Hungarian Forint, and the exchange \\nrate reached the 240 EUR/HUF limit. However, the Hungarian Central Bank did not intervene, \\ninstead it changed the exchange rate regime from a ﬁxed to a ﬂoating one.\\n±15 %\\n\\t\\t \\x0076'),\n",

First, exporters and \\nimporters on the goods and services markets can engage in international trade without concern \\nabout exchange rate movements. Any ﬁrms that accept the foreign currency as payment would \\nbe insulated from the risk that the currency could depreciate over time. In addition, any ﬁrm that \\nneed to obtain that foreign currency in the future would be insulated from the risk of the currency \\nappreciating over time. Firms can engage in direct foreign investment as well, as they hopefully \\ncan convert their foreign currency earnings into home currency without a major change in the \\nexchange rate. Third, investors would be able to invest funds in foreign countries without concern \\nthat the value of their investments decreases because of an appreciation. \\nA disadvantage of a ﬁxed exchange rate system is that there is still a risk of the central bank \\nchanging its currency’s value. Furthermore, from a macroeconomic point of view, a ﬁxed \\nexchange rate system may render the country more vulnerable to economic conditions in other \\neconomies. Remember, PPP claims that the the home and foreign inﬂation rates are in a long-run \\nequilibrium relationship with the exchange rate. If the exchange rate is ﬁxed, the inﬂation rate of \\nthe other economy is imported. Thus with a ﬁxed exchange rate a high foreign inﬂation can hurt \\nthe home economy. A ﬂoating exchange rate system can insulate the home economy from the \\ninﬂation of other countries. \\nIf the United States experiences a high rate of inﬂation, then the resulting increased US \\ndemand for UK goods will place upward pressure on the value of the British pound. The \\nappreciation will make UK goods more expensive for US consumers, even though UK \\nproducers have not raised their prices. The higher prices are caused by the pound’s \\nappreciation; that is, a greater number of dollars are now required to buy the same number of \\npounds. In the United Kingdom, the actual price of the goods (as measured in British pounds) \\nmay be unchanged. Even though US prices have increased, UK consumers will continue to \\npurchase US goods because they can exchange their pounds for more US dollars.\\nAnother advantage of a ﬂoating exchange rate is that a country is more insulated from \\nunemployment problems in other countries. \\nUnder a ﬂoating rate system, the decline in US purchases of UK goods will lead to reduced US \\ndemand for British pounds. Such a demand shift could cause the pound to depreciate against \\nthe dollar. This depreciation will make British goods cheaper for US consumers than before, \\noﬀsetting the reduced demand for these goods that may follow a reduction in US income. As \\nwas true with inﬂation, a sudden change in unemployment will have less eﬀect on a foreign \\ncountry under a ﬂoating rate system than under a ﬁxed rate system. \\nThese examples illustrate that in a freely ﬂoating exchange rate system, the problems experienced \\nin one country will not necessarily be contagious. Exchange rate adjustments serve as a form of \\nprotection against “exporting” economic problems to other countries. An additional advantage of \\na freely ﬂoating exchange rate system is that a central bank is not required to constantly maintain \\nexchange rates within speciﬁed boundaries. It is therefore never required, just for the sake of \\ncontrolling exchange rates, to implement an intervention policy that could have an unfavourable \\neﬀect on the economy. Furthermore, each government is free to implement policies irrespective of \\ntheir eﬀect on the exchange rate. Finally, if exchange rates were not allowed to ﬂoat, then \\ninvestors would invest funds in whatever country had the highest interest rate. The likely result \\nwould be governments of countries with low interest rates seeking to restrict the exit of investor \\nfunds from the country. Hence there would be more restrictions on capital ﬂows, and ﬁnancial \\nmarket eﬃciency would be reduced. \\nIn the previous example, the United Kingdom is somewhat insulated from the problems \\nexperienced in the United States because of the freely ﬂoating exchange rate system.

There is another \\nso-called prefunction or zero function namely the creation of legal institutions. Examine \\nthe functions in order.\\nAllocation of resources \\nAccording to the First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economic s the perfect \\ncompetition leads to Pareto-eﬃcient allocation of resources.  In Pareto optimum no \\nindividual utility can be made better oﬀ cannot without worsening someone else’s utility. \\nThe Utility Possibilities Curve shows the maximal available utility of the second person (or \\nsocial class) in function of the achieved utility of the ﬁrst person (or social class) at a given \\nlevel of resources of the examined economy.

The market failures are the following:\\n• public goods, \\n• externalities, \\n• asymmetric information, \\n• monopoly. \\nPublic goods  have two characteristics: their consumption is non-rivalrous and non-\\nexcludable. A good or service is non-rivalrous when someone’s consumption does not \\ndisturb others’ consumption. Individual utility from consumption will not be less if other \\nindividuals consume the same good. A good or service is non-excludable if it is possible \\nto prevent consumption in case of non-payment. By the two characteristics four sets of \\ngroups can be constructed (Table 1).\\n\\t\\t \\x0079\\nA D\\nC\\nB\\nU(1)\\nU(2)'),\n",

If no one can be excluded from the consumption of a good \\nand at the same time the consumption does not disturb others then nobody will be \\ninterested in producing this good. Free riding is a rational habit/attitude: just enjoying the \\nproduced good but not participating in the ﬁnancing/funding . If everyone thinks rationally \\nno one will produce public goods, however, there is a massive demand for them. In the \\nimplementation of producing public  goods the government can play a role. If the market \\ncannot achieve the Pareto-optimal resource allocation (market failure), then the \\ngovernment has to intervene and solve the problem. In this case the public sector can \\nimprove the eﬃciency – we call it Pareto-improvement. Adam Smith also supported the \\nstate’s intervention in the case of public goods, however, he devoted minimal role to  the \\npublic sector.\\nThe second type of market failures is externality. When an economic actor does not \\ncalculate with every consequence of his activities  we speak about external economic \\neﬀect. Imagine a company that works near by a river and pollutes it. \\nSuppose, that the company does not care about the pollution while calculating the \\ncosts and returns. The marginal proﬁt function is decreasing in line with the quantity of \\nproduction as Figure 2 shows. This marginal proﬁt becomes 0 when the production \\nachieves the quantity Q’. Above this quantity the total proﬁt will decrease because the \\nmarginal proﬁt will be negative. At this point (Q’) the proﬁt is at its maximum so this \\nrepresents the market equilibrium. Assume that there is a beach near by the river a few \\nkilometres away from the factory. The pollution of the factory causes cleaning costs for \\nthis beach. This (external) costs are increasing in line with the quantity of production as \\nFig. 2 shows. The external costs and the marginal proﬁt functions cross at quantity Q*. \\nThis is a special point. The whole marginal proﬁt function for the society (hereafter the \\nsocial marginal proﬁt) comes from the distinction of individual marginal proﬁt and the \\nexternal cost functions (see Figure 3). At Q* the social marginal proﬁt is zero. This point \\nwill be the Pareto-optimal quantity. If the factory produces less than Q*, its marginal \\nproﬁt would exceed the external cost of pollution so the company would be able to \\ncompensate the cleaning cost of the beach. If the factory compensates the beach \\nindeed the company can increase its production until Q*. If the production exceeded \\nQ*, the marginal proﬁt wouldn’t be able to compensate the external costs since it is \\nless than the external cost.

The \\nmost important principles are the following.\\n➡ First of all the revenues have to cover the government’s expenditures. \\nThe tax system has to take into consideration equity, that is taxes should be fair. Two \\nprinciples deal with this topic. \\n➡ The beneﬁt principle suggests that everyone should pay contribution proportional to \\nthe rate as (s)he enjoys public services . This concept does not calculate with the \\nredistributional objectives. Usually those people require most public services (health \\ncare or education) who could not achieve private services. \\n➡ The principle of ability-to-pay  deals with this question fundamentally. It says that \\neveryone should be charged according to their capacity to pay taxes . Horizontal equity \\nprevails if those with the same capacity are treated equally, whereas vertical equity \\nclaims that those with higher capacity must pay higher taxes.  The so-called equal \\nsacriﬁce principles give 3 diﬀerent solutions for the tax determination problem. \\nThe Principle of equal absolute sacriﬁce  requires that the absolute change in the \\nutility has to be the same amount for every person in the society, that is\\nGDP\\xa0=\\xa0VAT\\xa0+\\xa0taxbase\\xa0of\\xa0VAT\\xa0=\\xa00,2x\\xa0taxbase\\xa0of\\xa0VAT\\xa0+\\xa0taxbase\\xa0of\\xa0VAT\\xa0=\\xa01,2\\xa0x\\xa0taxbase\\xa0of\\xa0VAT\\nVAT = 0.2 * GDP\\n1,2 = 0.1667 * GDP\\n\\t\\t \\x0085'),\n",

Only some part of the \\ndecrease in consumer’s and producer’s surpluses was realised by the state as taxes. The \\nremaining part is lost for the society, this is the excess burden of the taxation. The less is \\nthe price elasticity the less is the deadweight loss. From the aspect of eﬃciency any good \\nwith inelastic demand is an adequate tax base. However these goods have usually low \\nincome elasticity as well, thus taxing them charges mainly the poor.

The book is\\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\\nPreface 1'),\n",

It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\\nPedagogical Foundation\\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice. Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the\\nauthors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people\\nand businesses.\\nThroughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the\\nimportance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types include FRED\\n(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed)® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices.\\nPractical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas\\nInstruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets\\nare included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for\\nstudent reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the\\nchapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7, 8, 9) and statistics (Chapters 14, 15, 16) problems. The\\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making. Chapters 13 and 14\\n(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about the R software\\n(https://openstax.org/r/r-software) package to promote further interest in trends in data science.\\nTeaching Plan Options\\nPrinciples of Finance includes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts\\nfrom prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters\\non prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-\\nsemester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend\\nfocusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:\\n1 Introduction to Finance Core\\n2 Corporate Structure and Governance Core\\n3 Economic Foundations: Money and Rates Extension\\n4 Accrual Accounting Process Extension\\nTable 1\\n2 Preface\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Without good financial protocol,\\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\\nIntroduction to Finance\\n1\\n1 • Why It Matters 7'),\n",

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\\n1.1 What Is Finance?\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the main areas in finance.\\n• Explain the importance of studying finance.\\n• Discuss the concepts of risk and return.\\nDefinition of Finance\\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\\ndecision makers.\\nBasic Areas in Finance\\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\\nBusiness Finance\\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\\n1 Dun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\\n8 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Working capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\\nthey are separate.\\n2. Capital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\\nvalue of the firm.\\n3. Capital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\\nand equity financing.\\nInvestments\\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\\n1.1 • What Is Finance? 9'),\n",

In these programs, the players and their decisions\\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\\nprosper.\\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\\n10 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The ease with\\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

These studies in turn may qualify\\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\\nCareers in Finance.\\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\\npaychecks.\\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\\nof both new and old financial products.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nJob Information\\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you.

Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\\nRisk and Return in Finance\\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\\nwhere’s the risk?\\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\\n12 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Return could be\\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\\n• Default risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\\n• Inflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\\n• Diversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\\n• Non-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\\n• Political risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\\n1.1 • What Is Finance? 13'),\n",

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\\nstrategic planning.\\nFinancial Planning\\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\\n• It uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\\n14 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization 15'),\n",

The\\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the role of data in finance.\\n• List and describe the various types of corporate data available.\\n• Explain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\\n• Describe the impact of data digitization.\\n• Explain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\\nImportance of Data\\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\\nBasic Data Types\\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\\n1. The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\\n2. Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\\n3. Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\\n16 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time?

Should you manufacture overseas where\\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\\napplying financial principles can help.\\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular\\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019.

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\\nmarket transactions.\\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\\nKey Market Players\\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\\n6 Ibid.\\n1.5 • Markets and Participants 21'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='Figure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\\nDealers\\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\\nBrokers\\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\\nFinancial Intermediaries\\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\\n22 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define microeconomics and macroeconomics.\\n• Discuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\\n• Explain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.\\nMicroeconomics\\nIn the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely\\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\\nconsumers.\\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\\nsupply and demand.\\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\\nMacroeconomics\\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\\n7 United States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters 23'),\n",

Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\\nforecasting models.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nPolitics and Stock Markets\\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this fun comparison chart\\n(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net) of political economic performance that measures stock market\\nreturns by each administration going back to President Warren Harding in 1920. Who had the highest\\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\\nBarack Obama?\\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\\nthese factors.\\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national\\nrate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers\\nwho could form neon signs. However, the unemployment rate helped inform the company about the\\nprobability of demand for new businesses and the signs they would need.\\n1.7 Financial Instruments\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Differentiate between money and capital markets.\\n• List money market instruments.\\n• List capital market instruments.\\nMoney Markets and Instruments\\nThe money market is the market for short-term, low-risk, highly liquid securities. “Short-term” refers to\\nmoney market securities having maturities of less than one year–sometimes as short as overnight. “Low\\nrisk” specifically means that the probability of default by the issuer in very unlikely.

Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills.

For example, credit card\\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\\n2008.\\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\\nCP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\\npaper until maturity.\\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\\nmaturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other\\ntypes of deposits.\\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on\\n9 Henrik Bessembinder, Chester Spatt, and Kumar Venkataraman. “A Survey of the Microstructure of Fixed-Income Markets.”\\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.

The federal funds market traditionally\\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds\\ninterest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\\nCapital Markets and Instruments\\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market\\ninstruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock\\nmarkets.\\nThe federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay\\npast borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\\nTreasury notes.\\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\\nrating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often\\nissues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline\\nthe rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or\\nmore of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard\\n“boilerplate” contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue. Because of these non-\\nstandardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for trading used bonds typically requires a\\nbroker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\\nAn important goal of business executives is to maximize the owners’ wealth. For corporations, shares of stock\\nrepresent ownership. Stocks are difficult to price compared to bonds. Bonds have contracts that specify the\\nnumber and amount of all payments made by the firm to the purchasers of bonds. Stock cash flows are far\\nmore uncertain than bond cash flows. Stocks might or might not have periodic dividend payments, and an\\ninvestor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future. However, no contract guarantees the size of the\\ndividends or the time or resale price of the stock. Thus, the cash flows from stock ownership are more\\n10 Trading Economics. “United States Government Debt.” Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/\\ngovernment-debt\\n1.7 • Financial Instruments 27'),\n",

Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued\\nstocks in the over-the-counter market and organized exchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world\\nare the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges are located in the United States.\\n1.8 Concepts of Time and Value\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the impact of time on saving and spending.\\n• Describe economic value.\\nMany students don’t have a choice between saving and spending. College is expensive, and it is easy to spend\\nevery dollar you earn and to borrow to meet the rest of your obligations. Businesses, however, continually\\nmake decisions about when and how much money to borrow or invest. Bacon Signs established banking\\nrelationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line. Sometimes the best\\ndecision is to invest as soon as possible to grab opportunities, and other times it is better to delay new\\ninvestment in order to pay dividends to the owners of the company.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Marches On!\\nOnce you begin to save and invest, here is a “fun fact” about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)\\n(https://openstax.org/r/investopedia-djia), also known as the Dow 30. It first appeared on May 26, 1896, as\\na quick way for stock traders to assess if the stock market had gone “up or down” each day and by how\\nmuch. Here we are over 100 years later, and the Dow 30 index is alive and well. Of course, the 30 companies\\nhave changed, but the index does represent a continuous yardstick to measure stock performance over\\ntime. As Table 1.1 shows, it took from 1906 to 1972, or a little over 66 years, for the Dow 30 to increase\\ntenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a\\nlittle under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. Time will tell if or when the Dow 30 will top 100,000 at the closing\\nbell.\\nClosing Milestones Date\\n41 5/26/1896\\n100 1/12/1906\\n1,000 11/14/1972\\n10,000 3/29/1999\\n20,000 1/25/2017\\n30,000 11/24/2020\\nTable 1.1 The Dow 30 Closing\\nMilestones and Dates\\nImpact of Time on Saving and Spending\\nThe choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in\\n28 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='the future. Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\\nmillion!”\\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater\\nrisk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text,\\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,\\ndespite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate\\nof return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount\\nyou would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.\\nScenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of Table 1.2. In both scenarios, only\\nfive $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents\\ncould make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater\\ntime leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.\\nAverage Annual Rate of Return = 10%\\nAssumptions Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\\nStarting investment age 26 19 14 9\\nEnding investment age 60 25 18 13\\nTotal investments 35 7 5 5\\nTable 1.2 Four Investment Scenarios: Assumptions and Expected Outcomes\\n1.8 • Concepts of Time and Value 29'),\n",

Accountants\\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think\\nabout the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,\\nwhile economic value is what you are willing to pay.\\n30 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='Summary\\n1.1 What Is Finance?\\nFinance is the study of the trade-off between risk and expected return. There are three broad areas of finance:\\nbusiness finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions.\\n1.2 The Role of Finance in an Organization\\nThe accounting department creates financial statements, and the finance department implements the firm’s\\npolicy objectives, monitors results, and responds to necessary strategic and tactical changes. Finance is\\nresponsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\\nhave a claim against firm assets.\\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\\nfor their stakeholders.\\n1.4 Careers in Finance\\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\\nto manufacturing, to education.\\n1.5 Markets and Participants\\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\\nforecasting.\\n1.7 Financial Instruments\\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money\\nmarkets and capital markets. Money markets consist of short-term marketable securities, and capital markets\\nfocus on longer-term securities such as bonds and stocks.\\n1.8 Concepts of Time and Value\\nThe concepts of time and value involve the resolution of conflict between consumption now versus\\nconsumption later.

In\\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\\nSome examples of these might include the following:\\n• Expanding sales to existing customers\\n• Increasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\\n• Developing new products for current and potential customers\\n• Becoming international by setting up an online ordering service\\nCorporate Structure and Governance\\n2\\n2 • Why It Matters 39'),\n",

One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\\n2.1 Business Structures\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the business form created by most organizations.\\n• Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\\n• Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\\n• List and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal\\nstructure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a\\nsignificant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the\\nfollowing:\\n1. Sole proprietorships\\n2. Partnerships\\n3. Corporations\\n4. Hybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)\\nThe vast majority of businesses take the form of a proprietorship. However, based on the total dollar value of\\ncombined sales, more than 80 percent of all business in the United States is conducted by a corporation.1\\nBecause corporations engage in the most business, and because most successful businesses eventually\\nconvert into corporations, we will focus on corporations in this chapter. However, it is still important to\\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\\nSole Proprietorships\\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\\n1. They have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\\n1 Aaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings. The Brookings Institution, May 15, 2017.\\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses\\n40 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Taxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate\\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\\n4. Controlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\\nshortcomings:\\n1. A sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\\ncoverage the business might have).\\n2. Unlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\\n3. Because of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\\nbusinesses.\\n4. A sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\\noutweigh the advantages.\\nPartnerships\\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\\nraise large amounts of capital.\\n2.1 • Business Structures 41'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='Corporations\\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\\ncompany.\\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\\nsize and complexity.\\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\\nbusinesses.\\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\\n42 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\\nfavorable growth opportunities.\\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nAmazon\\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\\n2.1 • Business Structures 43'),\n",

In order to begin the process of\\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\\narticles of incorporation include the following:\\n• Domestic corporation (in state)\\n• Foreign corporation (out of state or out of country)\\n• Close (closely held) corporation\\n• Professional corporation\\n• Nonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\\n• Stock corporation\\n• Non-stock corporation\\n• Public benefit corporation\\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\\n2.2 Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the difference between principals and agents.\\n• List and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\\n• Explain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\\nStakeholders\\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.\\nDifferent stakeholders have different priorities, and companies often have to make compromises to please as\\nmany stakeholders as possible.\\n44 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

They are entitled to vote on\\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\\ncompany’s financial statements.\\nTypes of Shareholders\\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\\nmanagement.\\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\\nRole of Management\\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is\\n2.2 • Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management 45'),\n",

Every public company is legally required to install a\\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\\n2.0)\\n46 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\\nthe prominent executive officer.\\nOversight: Corporate Governance\\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\\nand regulations.\\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\\nfollowing:\\n• That the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\\nfinancial reporting\\n• That the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\\nreporting of financial results\\n• That the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\\nthe most recent fiscal year\\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\\nauditors.

Boards now oversee the monitoring\\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\\n• confirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\\n• verifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\\n• ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\\n• verifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\\n• coordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\\nand efficient oversight and governance.

The\\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\\n48 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Why do you\\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\\nCompanies list for 2021?\\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\\ncompanies.\\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\\n• helps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\\nshareholders;\\n• allows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\\n• enables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\\nself-profiting motives.\\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most\\nbusinesses and organizations around the world.\\nBoard members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of\\nsuch challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and\\nobjectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk,\\nimproving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry. This has left corporate\\ngovernance experts and researchers in a situation where they find themselves “playing catch-up” to\\nadequately diversify.\\n2.3 • Role of the Board of Directors 49'),\n",

In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\\ngovernment agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nExample of an Agency Problem\\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\\nStockholders versus Management\\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\\nof agency problem.\\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\\n50 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\\nInvestors versus Creditors\\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\\npossible default.\\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\\nother stakeholders.\\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\\nenvironment.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nInfamous Agency Problems\\nEnron\\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem. Enron’s directors were responsible for\\nprotecting and promoting investor interests, but they failed to carry out their regulatory and oversight\\nresponsibilities, enabling the company to venture into illegal activity.

It had also started incurring a tremendous amount of\\ndebt. Fearing a drop in stock prices, Enron’s management team tried to disguise the problems by\\nmisrepresenting them through inappropriate accounting methods, which resulted in confusing and\\nmisleading financial statements.\\nDisaster started to unfold in 2001, when common stock prices fell from $90 to under $1 per share. The\\ncompany filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, and criminal charges were brought against several key\\nEnron employees, including former CEO Kenneth Lay and former CFO Andrew Fastow. Jeffrey Skilling was\\nsubsequently named CEO in February 2001, but he ended up resigning six months later.\\nBernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\\nsaves money.\\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\\noversight.\\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\\nhad been newly invested.\\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\\n(Sources: Diana B.

When perpetuated, these differences may\\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business\\noperations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.\\nWhile there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can\\n52 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='help mitigate such issues include the following:\\n• Offering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior\\n• Awarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation\\npackages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’\\npriorities\\n• Penalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior\\nThe prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage\\nhard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be\\nencouraged to act in the business’s best interest.\\nAnother means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat\\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\\nImpact of ESG Ratings\\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\\nfactors and performance.\\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\\nwhen necessary.\\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards 53'),\n",

In any case,\\nit is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a\\nbusiness and its direction. In the end, it does not present the entire story of a firm. Any investment decisions\\nabout the company in question should include a significant amount of additional data.\\n2.5 Interacting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define the investor relations function.\\n• Discuss how the investor relations office interacts with investors, regulators, and other corporate\\nstakeholders.\\n• Describe the topics most often discussed during a quarterly conference call.\\n• Explain how press release information impacts company stock prices.\\nInvestor Relations\\nWithin the general field of corporate public relations is a specific subdivision referred to as investor relations\\n(IR). IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of\\ninformation from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.\\nBecause the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any\\ncorporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or\\npotential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these\\ncrucial relationships.\\nInvestor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very\\nclosely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,\\nsuch as the CEO and CFO.\\nAs might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely\\ndue to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting\\nStandards (IFRS). IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed\\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection\\nAct. This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for\\nany publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial\\nscandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.\\nIn summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,\\n• coordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;\\n• disseminating financial information to the investment community;\\n• conducting briefings to the financial analyst community;\\n• publishing the quarterly report and annual report; and\\n• addressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.\\nThe best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of\\nbecoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.\\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Calls\\nAs a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain\\n54 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Reports filed with the SEC include the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and\\ncurrent periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting\\ndocuments. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies\\nand are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.\\nDepending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings press\\nrelease and conduct a conference call with the investment community within this same 45-day period. There\\nis no legal requirement for companies to do either of these things, but experts in IR view these\\ncommunications tools as best practice. They can add context and commentary to the reported financial\\nresults.\\nIt is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call\\nunprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation.\\nAmong such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and\\nearnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company’s primary industry; and\\nfinancial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are\\nemployed by financial brokerage firms.\\nInvestment Meetings and Conferences\\nOrganizing the annual meeting of shareholders, investor roadshows, and investment conferences is no easy\\ntask for any corporation, though all of these audience-facing events are critical to maintaining strong relations\\nwith shareholders and the investment community. It is important to reach shareholders and investors on an\\nalmost personal basis by crafting a successful and interesting investment story. For effective investor relations,\\nkey messages supporting any ownership or potential investment case should be clear and consistent. These\\nkey messages should be embedded within the company’s materials and should form the basis of\\npresentations, the corporate website, and annual reports. They should also be reinforced via concrete\\nexamples during annual meetings, roadshows, and investor presentations.\\nFigure 2.4 Quarterly Investor Relations Presentation (credit: “MAPFRE” by Castilla y León Económica/flickr, CC BY 2.0)\\nCorporations have found that using senior management’s time efficiently is also important to investor\\nrelations. By targeting the ownership and potential investing audience, senior executives can make the best\\nuse of their time and improve their interactions with the investing public during these events.

In this chapter, we explore some of the economic concepts that managers should use as part of\\ntheir strategic plan.\\n3.1 Microeconomics\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify equilibrium price and quantity.\\n• Discuss how changes in demand will impact equilibrium price and quantity.\\n• Discuss how changes in supply will impact equilibrium price and quantity.\\nDemand\\nMicroeconomics focuses on the decisions and actions of individual agents, such as businesses or customers,\\nwithin the economy. The interactions of the decisions that businesses and customers make will determine the\\nprice and quantity of a good or service that is sold in the marketplace. Financial managers need a strong\\nfoundation in microeconomics. This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\\nPrice ($) Quantity\\n30 0\\n25 10\\n20 20\\n15 30\\n10 40\\n5 50\\nTable 3.1 Demand\\nSchedule for Pizza\\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\\n68 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='Figure 3.2 Demand Curve for Pizzas\\nThe inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.\\nFirst, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you\\ndiminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher. The\\ndemand schedule for pizzas might look like Table 3.2 after an increase in the price of hamburgers.\\nPrice ($) Quantity\\n30 9\\n25 19\\n20 29\\n15 39\\n10 49\\n5 59\\nTable 3.2 Demand\\nSchedule for Pizzas\\nafter the Price of\\nHamburgers Doubles\\n3.1 • Microeconomics 69'),\n",

This could happen if people’s tastes\\nand preferences changed.

All\\nother relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such\\nas the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move.

In the example shown in Figure 3.5, when the price is $15, consumers want to purchase 30 pizzas and\\nsellers want to make 30 pizzas available for purchase. The market is in balance.\\nA price higher than the equilibrium price will not be sustainable in a competitive marketplace. If the price of a\\npizza were $20, suppliers would make 40 pizzas available, but the quantity of pizzas demanded would be only\\n20 pizzas. This would be a surplus, or excess quantity supplied, of pizzas. Restaurant owners who see that they\\nhave 40 pizzas to sell but can only sell 20 of those pizzas will lower their prices to encourage more customers\\nto purchase pizzas. At the same time, the restaurant owners will cut back on their pizza production. This\\nprocess will drive the pizza price down from $20 toward the equilibrium price.\\nThe opposite would occur if the price of a pizza were only $5.

The reason for this is inflation, or\\na general increase in price levels.\\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\\nhas risen.\\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\\n76 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\\nago.\\nHow Is Inflation Measured\\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe Billion Prices Project\\nAlthough the concept of inflation as a rise in the general price level is simple, measuring and documenting\\nthis increase is complicated. The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\\n3.2 • Macroeconomics 77'),\n",

Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world.

The graph shows that for the past\\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.\\nFigure 3.10 Rate of Inflation Measured by the Consumer Price Index, 1947–20202\\nThe Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a measure of the average monthly\\nchange in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also\\nrepresent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88% of the total\\npopulation, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed workers, short-\\nterm workers, unemployed workers, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\\nThe CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and\\nsewer service), and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and\\napproximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are\\naveraged with weights representing their importance in the spending of a particular group. The index\\nmeasures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the\\noriginal unadjusted index distributed, the BLS also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series\\nreflects all factors that may influence a change in prices.

Purchases are divided\\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\\ncups of coffee, and clothing.

The investment\\nspending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.\\nGovernment spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would\\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\\nHistorical Trends in GDP\\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\\nyears.\\n5 “GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\\n3.2 • Macroeconomics 81'),\n",

The company would have had to pay $15\\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\\nRisk Premiums\\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\\ngiven time.\\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\\nare occurring are extremely low.\\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\\n3.4 • Interest Rates 87'),\n",

Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who\\nare higher risk.\\nCompanies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US\\ngovernment. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn\\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks.

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\\nof\\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\\nexchange rate.\\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nCurrency Conversion\\nDo you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much\\nthat 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one\\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\\nCurrency Appreciation\\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates 89'),\n",

What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\\nCurrency Depreciation\\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was , it\\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\\ndepreciate.\\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\\nExchange Rate Risk\\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\\nrate is , the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar\\nappreciates. Likewise, when the dollar appreciates, some of the ski lodge’s US-based customers may choose\\ninstead to visit a resort in Mexico, where their purchasing power is strong.\\n90 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\\n3.2 Macroeconomics\\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\\ntrough.

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\\nCash-Basis Accounting\\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\\n102 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 116}, page_content='expense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\\nWho Uses Each Method?\\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?\\nYou are a new accountant at a beauty salon. The salon had previously used cash-basis accounting to\\nprepare its financial records but is now considering switching to an accrual-basis method. You have been\\ntasked with determining if this transition is appropriate.\\nWhen you go through the records, you notice that this transition will greatly impact how the salon reports\\nrevenues and expenses. The salon will now report some revenues and expenses before it receives or pays\\ncash.\\nHow will this change positively impact its business reporting? How will it negatively impact its business\\nreporting? If you were the accountant, would you recommend the salon transition from cash basis to\\naccrual basis?\\nSolution:\\nAccrual accounting creates a more accurate picture of profit or loss, so the salon’s owner can have a better\\nunderstanding of its profitability from period to period. However, it can be more work to record under\\naccrual accounting. If the salon is small and the profits and costs are easily understood, it might not be\\nworth the extra effort to the owner to use accrual-basis accounting. If the salon is seeking ways to better\\nunderstand profits and costs, accrual-basis accounting would be a great choice.\\n4.1 • Cash versus Accrual Accounting 103'),\n",

In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\\n104 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\\nThe Accounting Equation\\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nThe Accounting Equation\\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\\ndegree pursued.\\nSolution:\\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\\naccounting value of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and\\nservices) increase the accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization\\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting 105'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 119}, page_content='Likewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So\\neach dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same\\napproach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statements:\\n• Gains increase the value (equity) of the organization.\\n• Losses decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\\n• Investments by owners increase the value (equity) of the organization.\\n• Distributions to owners decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\\n• Changes in assets and liabilities can either increase or decrease the value (equity) of the organization\\ndepending on the net result of the transaction.\\nLet’s look at Chris’s Landscaping business again and do the same quick exercise you did with your personal\\nfinances. If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the\\naccounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or\\nDouble-Entry Accounting\\nAccounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:\\n• Each time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two\\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\\n• Not only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\\nimpacted.\\n• The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple\\nbut detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\\nDebits and Credits\\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary. We can illustrate\\neach account type and its corresponding debit and credit effects in the form of an expanded equation (see\\nFigure 4.4).\\n106 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='Figure 4.4 Expanded Accounting Equation\\nAs we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets accounts increase on the debit side and\\ndecrease on the credit side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts. Liabilities increase on the\\ncredit side and decrease on the debit side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts. This\\nbecomes easier to understand as you become familiar with the normal balance of an account.\\nThe balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (see Figure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one\\nsection and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken\\ndown on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and\\ntransparency. Current assets are those that are consumed within a year. Assets that will be in use longer than\\na year are considered noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be due within a year. Noncurrent\\nliabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future.\\nFigure 4.5 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\\nnoncurrent. Also highlighted are the various activities that affect the equity (or net worth) of the business.\\nNotice each account subcategory (Current Assets and Noncurrent Assets, for example) has an “increase” side\\nand a “decrease” side. As you may recall, these are called T-accounts, and they are used to analyze\\ntransactions.\\nThe basic components of even the simplest accounting system are accounts and a general ledger. An account\\nis a record showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and equity—the basic components found in\\nthe accounting equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a\\ncompany maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s\\naccounts with their individual balances.\\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.\\n• Explain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.\\n• Assess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.\\nYou’ve learned the basics of each method as well as the accounting equation and double-entry accounting.\\nNext, let’s turn our attention to when we record transactions, as timing is key.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is the value of goods and services the organization sold or provided to customers for a given period\\nof time.

It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services\\nprovided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCoffee Shop Products\\nThink about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as\\nrevenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and\\nrelated items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\\nSolution:\\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,\\nwith the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded\\nuntil May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded\\nin the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be\\nrecorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its\\ncustomer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual\\naccounting (see Figure 4.6).\\nFigure 4.6 Credit versus Cash On the left is a credit sale recorded under the cash basis of accounting. On the right, the same credit\\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\\n108 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Similar to a sale, a\\npurchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later\\ndate (on account). A purchase paid with cash at the time of the sale would be recorded in the financial\\nstatements under both cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. It makes sense because the business\\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier and paid the supplier at the same time. It is considered two\\nevents that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\\nIf the purchase was made on account (also called a credit purchase), however, the transaction would be\\nrecorded differently under each of these types of accounting.

To provide an industry-wide approach, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and other\\nrelated updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. The American Institute of Certified\\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\\nrevenue recognition.\\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\\nrecognize revenue?\\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\\ngovernment.\\nExpense Recognition\\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers. In our opening example, the\\nexpenses that Chris incurred totaled $1,150 (consisting of $100 for brakes, $50 for fuel, and $1,000 for\\ninsurance). You might think of expenses as the opposite of revenue, in that expenses reduce Chris’s checking\\naccount balance. Likewise, expenses decrease the value of the business and represent the dollar value of costs\\nincurred to provide goods and services to customers for a given period of time.\\n1 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). “Revenue Recognition.” n.d. https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/\\naccountingfinancialreporting/revenuerecognition.html\\n2 Len Jui and Jessie Wong. “Roles and Importance of Professional Accountants in Business.” China Accounting Journal.

For accounting purposes, assets are categorized as current versus long term\\nand tangible versus intangible. Any asset that is expected to be used by the business for more than one year is\\nconsidered a long-term asset. These assets are not intended for resale and are anticipated to help generate\\nrevenue for the business in the future. Some common long-term assets are computers and other office\\nmachines, buildings, vehicles, software, computer code, and copyrights. Although these are all considered\\nlong-term assets, some are tangible and some are intangible.\\nTo better understand the nature of fixed assets, let’s get to know Liam and their new business. Liam is excited\\nto be graduating from their MBA program and looks forward to having more time to pursue their business\\nventure. During one of their courses, Liam came up with the business idea of creating trendy workout attire.\\nFor their class project, they started silk-screening vintage album cover designs onto tanks, tees, and yoga\\npants. They tested the market by selling their wares on campus and were surprised how quickly and how often\\nthey sold out. In fact, sales were high enough that they decided to go into business for themselves. One of\\ntheir first decisions involved whether they should continue to pay someone else to silk-screen their designs or\\ndo their own silk-screening. To do their own silk-screening, they would need to invest in a silk screen machine.\\nLiam will need to analyze the purchase of a silk screen machine to determine the impact on their business in\\nthe short term as well as the long term, including the accounting implications related to the expense of this\\nmachine. Liam knows that over time, the value of the machine will decrease, but they also know that an asset\\nis supposed to be recorded on the books at its historical cost. They also wonder what costs are considered part\\nof this asset. Additionally, Liam has learned about the matching principle (expense recognition) but needs to\\nlearn how that relates to a machine that is purchased in one year and used for many years to help generate\\nrevenue. Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.\\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item? 111'),\n",

Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\\nwarrant capitalizing it.\\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7). As shown in the figure, this net total includes land and buildings,\\nmachinery, equipment and internal-use software, and leasehold improvements, resulting in a gross PP&E of\\n$103.526 million—less accumulated depreciation and amortization of $66.760 million—to arrive at the net\\namount of $36.766 million.\\nFigure 4.7 Apple’s Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net (September 2020, in $ million)3 This report shows the company’s\\nconsolidated financial statement details as of September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nClassifying Assets and Related Expenditures\\nYou work at a business consulting firm.

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\\nasset.\\n3 In the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated\\ndepreciation and amortization” line item.\\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item? 113'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 127}, page_content='What Is Depreciation?\\nWhen a business purchases a long-term asset (used for more than one year), it classifies the asset based on\\nwhether the asset is used in the business’s operations. If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\\nthe land would be considered an investment.\\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\\nFundamentals of Depreciation\\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\\n1. Record the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\\noutflow of cash.\\n2. At the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\\nestimated useful life.\\nRecording the Initial Asset\\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\\nuseful life.\\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\\n• Book value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\\n• Useful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\\n• Salvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\\nassets.\\n• Depreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\\n$10,000.\\nDepreciation records an expense for the value of an asset consumed and removes that portion of the asset\\nfrom the balance sheet. The journal entry to record depreciation is shown in Figure 4.11.\\n4 United States Securities and Exchange Commission. “Waste Management, Inc.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 129}, page_content='Figure 4.11 Journal Entry for Depreciation Expense\\nDepreciation expense is a common operating expense that appears on an income statement. It represents the\\namount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\\nthrough depreciation.\\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nFixed Assets\\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania.

Recall that determination of the costs to be depreciated requires\\nincluding all costs that prepare the asset for use by the company. Liam’s example would include shipping and\\nsetup costs.

The units-of-production depreciation method bases depreciation on\\nthe actual usage of the asset, which is more appropriate when an asset’s life is a function of usage instead of\\ntime. For example, this method could account for depreciation of a silk screen machine for which the\\ndepreciable base is $48,000 (as in the straight-line method), but now the number of prints is important.\\nIn our example, the machine will have total depreciation of $48,000 over its useful life of 960,000 prints.\\nTherefore, we would divide $48,000 by 960,000 prints to get a cost per print of $0.05. If Liam printed 180,000\\nitems in the first year, the depreciation expense would be . The\\njournal entry to record this expense would be the same as with straight-line depreciation: only the dollar\\namount would have changed. The presentation of accumulated depreciation and the calculation of the book\\nvalue would also be the same.

They also expect (hope) that in two years\\nthey will need to buy a second silk screen machine to keep up with the demand for products of their\\ngrowing company. Which depreciation method makes more sense for Liam: higher expenses in the first few\\nyears or keeping expenses consistent over time? Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of\\ntime, but rather in the usage of the machine?\\nDouble-Declining-Balance Depreciation\\nThe double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it\\naccounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double\\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\\n118 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

However, depreciation expense is not\\npermitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated in Figure 4.15.\\nFigure 4.15 Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation, and Book Value, Years 1–5\\nNotice that in year four, the remaining book value of $12,528 was not multiplied by 40 percent. This is because\\nthe expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated\\nsalvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference\\nbetween the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to\\nits salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be taken in year five.\\nIn our example, the first year’s double-declining-balance depreciation expense would be\\n. For the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is multiplied by the\\nremaining book value of the asset. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until the book value and the\\nestimated salvage value are the same (in this case, $10,000). The net effect of the differences in straight-line\\ndepreciation versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the double-declining-balance method,\\nthe allowable depreciation expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed for straight-line\\ndepreciation. However, over the depreciable life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be the\\nsame no matter which method the entity chooses.

While this could be true, it’s not necessarily true. In this section you’ll\\nexplore key differences between cash flow, revenue, expense, profits, and losses.\\nCalculating Profit and Loss\\nNet income (net loss) is determined by comparing revenues and expenses. Net income is a result of revenues\\n(inflows) being greater than expenses (outflows). A net loss occurs when expenses (outflows) are greater than\\nrevenues (inflows). In accounting it is common to present net income in the following format:\\nRecall that revenue is the value of goods and services a business provides to its customers and increases the\\nvalue of the business. Expenses, on the other hand, are the costs of providing the goods and services and\\ndecrease the value of the business. When revenues exceed expenses, companies have net income. This means\\nthe business has been successful at earning revenues, containing expenses, or a combination of both. If, on\\nthe other hand, expenses exceed revenues, companies experience a net loss.

While\\nbusinesses work hard to avoid net loss situations, it is not uncommon for a company to sustain a net loss from\\ntime to time. It is difficult, however, for businesses to remain viable while experiencing net losses over the long\\nterm.\\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function is:\\nTo be complete, we must also consider the impact of gains and losses. While gains and losses are infrequent in\\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\\nProfit versus Cash Flow\\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the\\nneed for the statement of cash flows. Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content='Summary\\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\\nthey are incurred.\\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\\nof-production methods.\\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\\nKey Terms\\naccounting equation\\naccrual-basis accounting an accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\\nwhen paid\\ncapitalize the process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\\ncash-basis accounting a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\\ncredit a record of financial information on the right side of an account\\ndebit a record of financial information on the left side of each account\\n124 4 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Each statement provides different insights into a firm’s performance and financial health. Though some\\nusers may favor one or two statements over another, they are best used together to get a full picture.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll be introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\\nsmall merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to consumers) that sells\\nhunting and fishing gear. It needs financial statements to understand its profitability and current financial\\nposition, manage cash flow, and communicate its finances to outside parties like investors, governing bodies,\\nand lenders. We will walk through each financial statement, its components, how they are connected, and how\\nfinancial statement users understand each one.\\nFinancial Statements\\n5\\n5 • Why It Matters 129'),\n",

Thus, the statements are prepared in a\\nspecific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\\nrather than a net loss.\\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\\nSales and Gross Profit\\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\\nfuture results.\\nFirms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with\\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin gross profit/sales.) Cost of\\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\\ntheir Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.\\nTheir cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell.

A law office, for example, would include primarily the cost of labor in\\ntheir cost of services.\\nGross profit is a reflection of how profitable the firm’s performance was in its core business function. It\\nincludes only the core business and direct costs of performing that business. If the company were a shoe\\ncompany, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply making the shoes it sold. If it\\nwere a bakery, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply baking the goods it sold.\\nGross profit shows financial statement users how effective the business is at generating top-line profits on\\ntheir core business function. It does not reflect the performance of other areas of the firm such as other\\noperating costs to support the direct production process, indirect costs, and financing.\\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see its gross profit in Figure 5.2.

After\\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses. To sell its hunting and fishing equipment in the current year, Clear Lake\\nSporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500) and utilities for its retail and warehouse spaces ($2,500);\\nrecorded depreciation on equipment, buildings, and store furnishings (shelves, racks, etc.) ($3,600); and paid\\nsalaries to its indirect employees in accounting, purchasing, and human resources ($5,400).

What might it tell you about the company’s performance?\\nNet Income\\nFinally, we move on to net income, or what is commonly referred to as the bottom line. Net income (or loss)\\nreflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events\\noutside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at\\nnet income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are\\nthose that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a\\npiece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.\\nWe can see in Figure 5.4 that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense\\n132 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The classified balance sheet is prepared in sections that align with the\\naccounting equation.\\nRemember, the accounting equation reflects the assets (items owned by the organization) and how they\\nwere obtained (by incurring liabilities or provided by owners). Liabilities are debts owed to other parties.\\nStated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\\nThe classified balance sheet is thus broken down into three sections; assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. If\\n134 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content='prepared correctly, the total assets on the balance sheet equals the total liabilities and owner’s equity sections\\nof the balance sheet.\\nThe classified balance sheet is considered or termed classified when the assets and liabilities within the\\nbalance sheet are grouped into even smaller sections: current and noncurrent (see Figure 5.6). Both assets\\nand liabilities are broken down on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to\\nprovide more detail and transparency as well as abide by the convention of reporting in descending order of\\nliquidity. Current assets are those that can be used or converted to cash within a year. Common examples of\\ncurrent assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Assets that will be in\\nuse longer than a year are considered noncurrent. Common examples of noncurrent assets include notes\\nreceivable, machinery and equipment, buildings, and land.\\nJust as we noted a few key differences in the income statements based on the type of firm, you may also notice\\na few slight differences in the balance sheet depending on the firm type. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\\nretailer. Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”\\nThis is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of\\ncleaning supplies.\\nFigure 5.6 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\\nnoncurrent.\\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.\\nIt rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets. Of all its assets, only the equipment is long\\nterm.

The company’s current assets\\ndecreased from $162,819 in 2019 to $143,713 in 2020.

(Amounts are in\\nmillions.)\\nWe’ve covered the assets side of the accounting equation; now let’s turn our attention to the other side of the\\nequation and the other two sections of the balance sheet: liabilities and equity. Just like the assets section, the\\nliabilities section is broken down between current and noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be\\ndue within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and\\nunearned revenue. Noncurrent liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes\\npayable is a common noncurrent liability.\\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it\\nhasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts\\npayable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities. The note payable is not due for several years, thus\\nmaking it a noncurrent liability (see Figure 5.8).\\nFigure 5.8 Liability Section of Classified Balance Sheet\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCurrent and Noncurrent Liabilities\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Annual Report (https://openstax.org/r/2020-doc-financial-annual-report) for 2020 and\\nlocate the company’s balance sheet (the balance sheet begins on page 33). What is the amount of the\\ncompany’s total assets for the most recent year? What is the amount of its total liabilities and equity?\\nSolution:\\nApple’s total assets for 2020 were $323,888, and its total liabilities and equity were also $323,888. (Amounts\\nare in millions.)\\nImportance of the Balance Sheet\\nNow that we have gone to all the work to carefully assemble a classified balance sheet, what do we use it for?\\nThe answer lies within the accounting equation itself. Think of the accounting equation from a “sources and\\nclaims” perspective. Under this approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by\\nincurring liabilities or were provided by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by\\ncreditors and/or owners. The balance sheet shows us what the firm has (its assets), who owns them (equity),\\nand who the firm owes (its liabilities).\\nLimitations of the Balance Sheet\\nThe balance sheet is indeed a very helpful financial statement, but it also poses challenges. First, assets on the\\nbalance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are recorded at historical cost.\\nHistorical cost is simply the cost paid for the item at the time it was purchased. Changes in market value of big-\\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and\\ndepreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen\\non the balance sheet.\\nEstimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating\\ndepreciation is another common estimate. If these estimates are incorrect, the net value of the asset can be\\nunder- or overstated.\\nAnother key limitation is the fact that a balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time. This\\n5.2 • The Balance Sheet 137'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 151}, page_content='means that the account value could have been quite different on the day before or the day after the date of\\nthe balance sheet. For example, if a firm were concerned with certain ratios or investor/lender expectations of\\nits cash balance, it could choose to not pay several vendor payments in the last week of December. Thus, on\\nDecember 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week\\nof January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.\\nFinally, there are many possible things of value that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Internally\\ngenerated assets and the firm’s human capital are two common examples. Internally generated assets can be\\nanything from a website, a process, to an idea.\\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify connected elements between the balance sheet and the income statement.\\n• Differentiate between expenses and payables.\\nNet Income and Retained Earnings\\nAs mentioned earlier, the financial statements are linked by certain elements and thus must be prepared in a\\ncertain order. The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings\\nNow we can see the full flow of information from the income statement to the statement of retained earnings\\n(Figure 5.10) and finally to the balance sheet.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 153}, page_content='Expenses versus Payables\\nThere is another key relationship between the income statement and the balance sheet can often be confusing\\nto non-accountants: an expense versus a payable. The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This\\nmeans that every transaction has two sides: a debit and a credit. They must be equal. When Clear Lake records\\nan expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction. In this case, the company incurred\\nutilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts\\npayable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable\\nand reduce cash. Accounts payable is a liability found on the balance sheet, normally a current liability. The\\nexpense incurred caused the payable, but it is distinctly separate from the payable (see Figure 5.12).\\nFigure 5.12 Connections between Expenses and Accounts Payable\\n140 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The statement of owner’s equity addresses the last segment of the accounting\\nequation in detail by laying out the equity elements of the firm and highlighting changes in these elements\\nthroughout the period.\\nEquity represents the ownership of the firm. The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for\\ncorporations contains two primary categories of accounts. The first is paid-in capital or contributed\\ncapital—consisting of amounts paid in by owners. The second category is earned capital, consisting of\\namounts earned by the corporation as part of business operations. On the balance sheet, retained earnings is\\na key component of the earned capital section, while the stock accounts such as common stock, preferred\\nstock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary components of the contributed capital section.\\nCommon stock represents ownership in the firm. Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\\nadditional paid-in capital account.\\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\\nstock and retained earnings. Common stock in the prior year was $75,000 and increased to $80,000 in the\\ncurrent year, indicating Clear Lake issued additional common stock (see Figure 5.13).\\nFigure 5.13 Stockholder Equity Section of Balance Sheet\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nEquity Accounts\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What types of equity accounts does it report?\\nSolution:\\nApple reports common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income.\\nDistributions to Owners\\nWhen firms earn a profit, they have two options as to what to do with their earnings. They can keep (retain)\\nthem and reinvest them back into the business, or they can pay them out to their shareholders in the form of\\ndividends. Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\\nother assets as well.\\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\\nexisting shareholders.\\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\\ncash for other investments.\\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding. Treasury\\nshares are not outstanding, so no dividends are declared or distributed for these shares. Regardless of the\\ntype of dividend, the declaration always causes a decrease in the retained earnings account.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nDividends\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows 143'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 157}, page_content='consumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect. FASB (Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\\ncash basis, or cash flow.\\nOperating Activities\\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).\\nAs mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the\\nfirm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\\n144 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\PrinciplesofFinance.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='Figure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\\ncash flow.\\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\\nincrease to the statement.\\nTallying all these adjustments to net income shows Clear Lake’s net cash flows provided by operating activities\\nof $53,600 (see Figure 5.16).\\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows 145'),\n",

These are items that are capitalized (placed on the balance\\nsheet and depreciated over time) and thus did not reduce net income. They did, however, cause an impact to\\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year). They also\\npurchased additional plant assets in the amount of $13,600. This amount can be figured by comparing the\\ndifference in the current and prior plant assets accounts and including the impact of current year depreciation\\n($50,000 current year balance less $40,000 prior year balance and $3,600 of depreciation = $13,600 of new\\nassets purchased).\\nFigure 5.17 Investing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\\nFinancing Activities\\nRecall that financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business.

We can see this by the\\nincrease in their notes payable account from the prior year to current year ($40,000 to $50,000). This is an\\ninflow of cash and thus an increase on the statement. Dividends of $30,000 were paid to shareholders (found\\non the statement of retained earnings and the statement of owner’s equity).

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\\noperational cash flow.\\nFree Cash Flow\\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\\nManaging Cash Flow\\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses.

Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\\npayment terms.\\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\\ncash flow fluctuates.\\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships\\nbetween items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to\\nanother, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).\\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Prepare common-size statements.\\n• Assess organizational performance using common-size statements.\\n• Use industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.\\nCommon-Size Income Statements\\nA common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing\\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\\neach item on the income statement is:\\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements 149'),\n",

This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,\\ncompare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as\\nindustry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each\\ntype of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms\\nof expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance\\nsheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They\\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24).

Her income tax expense is a big use of her wages, but it is \\nunavoidable or nondiscretionary. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., \\nsaid, “Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.”[1]  \\nRanking expenses by size offers interesting insight into lifestyle choices. It is also \\nvaluable in framing financial decisions, pointing out which expenses have the largest \\nimpact on income and thus on the resources for making financial decisions. If Alice \\nwanted more discretionary income to make more or different choices, she can easily see \\nthat reducing rent expense would have the most impact on freeing up some of her wages \\nfor another use. \\nCommon-Size Cash Flow Statement \\nLooking at Alice’s negative cash flows as percentages of her positive cash flow (on the'),\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Gathering Financial Statements: Companies obtain their financial statements, which include the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. These statements provide information about the company's operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Understanding the Statements: The next step is to thoroughly understand each financial statement. This involves analyzing the numbers and ratios presented in the statements to gain insights into the company's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Comparing Historical Data: Companies compare their historical financial data with previous years' data to identify trends and patterns. This helps them assess whether their business is improving or deteriorating over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Analyzing Ratios: Financial analysts use various ratios, such as liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio), profitability ratios (gross profit margin, net profit margin), leverage ratios (debt-to-equity ratio), efficiency ratios (asset turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio), and cash flow ratios (cash flow margin) to evaluate the company's performance. These ratios provide a snapshot of the firm's financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Trend Analysis: By analyzing trends in these ratios over time, companies can identify areas that require improvement or focus on successful strategies. This helps them make informed decisions about investments, cost-cutting measures, and expansion plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Comparing with Industry Benchmarks: Companies also compare their financial performance to industry benchmarks or comparable firms within the same industry. This helps them assess whether they are outperforming or underperforming their peers and identify opportunities for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Analyzing Off-Balance Sheet Items: In addition to traditional financial statements, companies may analyze off-balance-sheet items such as lease obligations, pension liabilities, or derivatives to gain a comprehensive understanding of the firm's financial position.\n",
      "\n",

      "Human: Describe how companies perform financial analysis.\n",
      "AI: Based on the provided context, we can assume that the user is asking about how companies conduct financial analysis. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Gathering Financial Statements: Companies obtain their financial statements, which include the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. These statements provide information about the company's operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Understanding the Statements: The next step is to thoroughly understand each financial statement. This involves analyzing the numbers and ratios presented in the statements to gain insights into the company's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Comparing Historical Data: Companies compare their historical financial data with previous years' data to identify trends and patterns. This helps them assess whether their business is improving or deteriorating over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Analyzing Ratios: Financial analysts use various ratios, such as liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio), profitability ratios (gross profit margin, net profit margin), leverage ratios (debt-to-equity ratio), efficiency ratios (asset turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio), and cash flow ratios (cash flow margin) to evaluate the company's performance. These ratios provide a snapshot of the firm's financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Trend Analysis: By analyzing trends in these ratios over time, companies can identify areas that require improvement or focus on successful strategies. This helps them make informed decisions about investments, cost-cutting measures, and expansion plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Comparing with Industry Benchmarks: Companies also compare their financial performance to industry benchmarks or comparable firms within the same industry. This helps them assess whether they are outperforming or underperforming their peers and identify opportunities for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Analyzing Off-Balance Sheet Items: In addition to traditional financial statements, companies may analyze off-balance-sheet items such as lease obligations, pension liabilities, or derivatives to gain a comprehensive understanding of the firm's financial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Forecasting Future Performance: Based on the analysis of historical data and industry trends, companies make educated forecasts about their future performance. This involves estimating future revenues, expenses, profits, and cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Review by Experts: Finally, the company may have its financial statements audited or reviewed by independent experts to ensure accuracy and compliance with accounting standards. These external reviews provide additional credibility and confidence in the company's financial reporting.\n",

      "Chatbot: Companies can overcome the limitations of financial analysis by taking the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understanding the limitations: It is crucial to recognize that financial statement analysis has its limitations and biases. Economic influences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Companies should be aware of these limitations and not solely rely on financial statements for decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Considering other sources of information: Financial statements are just one piece of information. Companies can consider additional sources such as market research, customer feedback, industry trends, and competitor analysis to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Analyzing qualitative factors: Qualitative factors like brand reputation, employee satisfaction, and management expertise should be considered alongside financial data. These factors can provide valuable insights into the company's performance and future prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Conducting scenario planning: Companies can use scenario planning to assess potential risks and opportunities that may impact their business. This involves analyzing different possible scenarios and estimating how they might affect the company's financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Diversifying sources of funding: Relying solely on financial statements for decision-making can be limiting. Companies should diversify their funding sources, such as through strategic partnerships or alternative financing options, to reduce their dependence on a single source of capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs): Instead of relying solely on traditional financial ratios, companies can focus on KPIs that are specific to their industry or business model. These KPIs can provide a more accurate and relevant measure of the company's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Regularly updating and refining analysis: Financial statement analysis should be done regularly and continuously updated as new data becomes available. This ensures that the analysis is current and reflects any changes in the company's financial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Seeking expert opinions: Companies can seek input from experts such as auditors, financial analysts, or industry specialists to gain alternative perspectives on their financial performance. These experts can provide valuable insights and help identify potential areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Conducting sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis involves analyzing how changes in assumptions affect the company's financials. This can be done by varying different inputs such as revenue growth rates, cost structures, or interest rates to assess the robustness of the company's financial position.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Implementing internal controls and risk management practices: Companies should implement effective internal controls and risk management practices to ensure accurate and reliable financial reporting. This includes regular audits, robust accounting procedures, and monitoring for potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "By taking these steps, companies can overcome the limitations of financial analysis and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their business performance and prospects.\n"
