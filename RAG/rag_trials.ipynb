There are various other forms of tobacco use peculiar to\\ncertain geographic regions of India and these need special attention.\\nDiet\\nThe causes of cancer in U.S.A. was estimated by Doll and Peto in\\n1981. Tobacco was found to be responsible for 25-40% of cancers\\nand diet for 10-70% of cancers. In India dietary habits may be\\nresponsible for about 10 to 20% of cancers. Dietary factors may\\nenhance the role of other risk factors. Most of the cancers have some\\nrelationships with diet. Predominant among them are cancers of the\\nupper aero digestive tract (mouth, throat, oesophagus and lungs),\\nstomach, large intestine, and breast cancer in women.\\nThe role of diet takes special importance in countries like India,\\nwhich are fast moving towards industrialization and westernization.\\nWe had a predominantly plant based diet and with the advent of\\nwestern life style we are moving towards a diet rich in animal proteins.\\nThis coupled with other habits like smoking and alcohol will lead to\\nincrease in the chronic disease burden especially cancer and\\ncardiovascular diseases.

Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  3 Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the causes, prevention, and treatment of skin cancer. Skin cancers are defined as either malignant or benign cells that typically arise from excessive exposure to UV radiation. Arguably, skin cancer is a type of cancer that can most easily be prevented; prevention of skin cancer is relatively simple, but often ignored. An important aspect in discussing the epidemiology of skin cancer is understanding the treatments that are available, as well as the prevention methods that can be implemented in every day practice. It is estimated that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer during his or her lifetime, and that one person will die from melanoma every hour of the day. To an epidemiologist and health promotion advocate, these figures are daunting for a disease, especially for a disease that has ample means of prevention. However, even with sufficient prevention methods, a lack of education and promotion of a practice will not lead to favorable results. This thesis will aim to uncover the causes and treatments associated with skin cancer, the disease, distribution, and determinants of the disease, and finally, how the promotion of the practice of prevention of this disease can be furthered.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  4 Skin Cancer: Causes, Prevention, and Treatment Skin Cancer  Cancer, as defined by Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, is a “general term frequently used to indicate any of various types of malignant neoplasms, most of which invade surrounding tissues, may metastasize to several sites, and are likely to recur after attempted removal and to kill the patient unless adequately treated” (2017). Thus, skin cancers are cancers that arise from the abnormal division or mutation of skin cells. There are three main types of skin cancer: squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC), basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), and melanoma. Basal-cell skin cancer and squamous-cell skin cancer are both part of a broader category known as nonmelanoma skin cancer, whereas melanoma is an aggressive cancer that typically presents as a mole. Almost 90% of skin cancer cases are caused by an overexposure of UV radiation (Gallagher, 2010). Overexposure of UV radiation typically would be result of excessive time in the sun, but recently, tanning beds have become more popular among younger generations and have contributed to the rise in skin cancer prevalence significantly as a carcinogenic agent. While UV radiation is the primary environmental cause in skin cancer, other factors may include, but are not limited to: smoking, HPV, genetic syndromes, ionizing radiation, or the use of immunosuppressive medications (Salidi, 2005). While there are many cases of skin cancer in the United States, there are far fewer cases of melanoma among the population. Melanoma, which is also known as malignant melanoma, comes from skin cells known as melanocytes; melanoma is particularly common in fair-skinned, or pigment-lacking individuals, and is almost always the result of UV light. Malignant melanoma is diagnosed by a biopsy of the sample in question, and typically will be diagnosed by a '),\n",

A dermatologist is an individual who studies and diagnoses diseases related to the hair, skin, and nails. In diagnosing, dermatologists typically will follow the mnemonic “ABCDE” when looking at specific moles. The five important variables in looking for melanoma include: asymmetry, borders, color, diameter, and evolution over time. If the mole has irregular borders, varying colors, and a diameter greater than 6mm, it should be biopsied to be tested for melanoma (Gandhi, 2015).  Prevalence and Incidence of Skin Cancer  Overall, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer; nonmelanoma accounts for over 5.4 million cases in more than 3.3 million people in the United States (Robbins, 2016). It is estimated that the incidence of malignant melanoma in Europe and the United States has almost tripled in the last 30 years (Katalinic, 2012). According to Robbins, over the last 30 years, more people have had skin cancer than all other cancers combined; he also states that 1 in 5 people will develop skin cancer over the course of his or her lifetime (2016). According to Robbins (2016), it is estimated that one person will die from melanoma every hour, and while melanoma accounts for less than 1% of skin cancer cases, melanoma accounts for the majority of deaths that result from skin cancer. It has been determined that 86% of melanomas come from over exposure to the sun, and an individual’s risk for melanoma doubles if he or she has experienced multiple sunburns (Robbins, 2016). The American Academy of Dermatology states that melanoma has a high prevalence in Australia and New Zealand, but is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than it is in women and is mostly found in Caucasian individuals. Men have a higher incidence rate of melanoma than women, since the incidence rate in men aged 80 and older is three times higher than that '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  6 of women aged 80 and older (AAD, 2016). The incidence rate is much higher in Caucasian individuals than it is in African Americans and Hispanics. In Hispanics, the incidence rate is 4 per 100,000, in African Americans the incidence rate is 1 per 100,000; however, in Caucasians, the incidence rate is 25 per 100,000 (AAD, 2016).  The incidence rates of melanoma have increased in Caucasian women younger than 40 by 6.1% every year, which may be due to the increasingly popular use of indoor tanning and artificial UV light (AAD, 2016).  Epidemiology  To understand the epidemiology of a disease, one must first understand the concept of epidemiology. Epidemiology is defined by Friis (2010) as “an interdisciplinary approach . . . concerned with the distribution and determinants of health and diseases, morbidity, injuries, disability, and mortality in populations. Epidemiologic studies are applied to the control of health problems in populations” (p. 282).  The terminology of epidemiology is quite extensive but vital to understanding the concepts behind the study of disease prevalence and distribution in each population. Epidemiology has many aspects and characteristics that are used to reach a conclusion, which include: population focus, distribution, determinants, outcomes, quantification, and control of health problems (Friis, 2010). Population is defined as “all inhabitants of a given country or area considered together;” distribution is defined as “the occurrence of diseases and other health outcomes in various populations” while a determinant is “any factor that brings about a change in a health condition or other defined characteristic” (Friis, 2010, p. 282). The outcomes of disease included the morbidity and mortality of the disease; morbidity is the illness due to a disease, and mortality is the death due to a disease. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  7 Epidemiology is a quantitative study, which “refers to counting the cases of illness or other health outcomes” (Friis, 2010, p. 282). In studying the determinants and distribution of a disease, one of the end goals is prevention. According to Friis, there are three types of prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary prevention is before the disease ever occurs, secondary prevention is taking measures to prevent the disease while it is progressing, and tertiary prevention is during the later stages of the disease (Friis, 2010). Another important aspect of epidemiology is looking at the number of cases, both current cases and the number of new cases, in studying a disease; epidemiologists define this as the prevalence and incidence of a specific disease. The incidence of a disease is found by looking at the occurrence of new cases of the disease within a specific period, while the prevalence of a disease is the number of current cases of a specific disease at a given time (Friis, 2010). Another important factor associated with causation of a disease is different aspects of risk when determining the incidence and prevalence of a disease. A risk factor is defined by Friis (2010) as an “exposure that is associated with a disease, morbidity, mortality, or adverse health outcome” and risk assessment is “a methodology used to provide quantitative measurements of risk to health” (Friis, 2010, p. 282). Overall, epidemiology is a quantitative, observational study of the risks, prevalence, incidence, and outcomes of specific diseases. When healthcare professionals are observing the epidemiology of a certain disease, it is vital to have strong definitions of the terminology of the study method being used.  Skin Cancer in the United States  The American Academy of Dermatology also reiterates that skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States and that 20% of Americans will develop skin '),\n",

The American Academy of Dermatology states that over 8,500 people in the United States are diagnosed with skin cancer every day. Typically, a nonmelanoma skin cancer patch can be removed via cryotherapy or by same-day Mohs surgery in a dermatology clinic, whereas a melanoma skin cancer requires extensive removal. The American Academy of Dermatology reported that melanoma incidence rates have double from 1982 to 2011; they also reported that men aged 50 and older have a higher risk of developing melanoma than the rest of the population; however, melanoma is the second most common form of cancer in females younger than 30 due to indoor tanning and overexposure to UV light (AAD, 2016). According to T. Kornek (2013), “The increase of new cases of skin cancer since the 1970s is attributed to altered leisure time activity with the associated increased UV exposure” (p. 287). It is interesting to note that even with an increase in skin cancer prevention awareness as technology has increased, skin cancer cases are still on the rise, rather than being reduced. This particular area of disease should be placed at the foremost agenda of the health promotion community because skin cancer is an entirely preventable disease. Because skin cancer can be prevented and has an attributable cause, it is vital that skin cancer prevention should be emphasized among communities in order to inhibit the increase of skin cancer.  There are many ways to prevent skin cancer, but in order to understand prevention, one must first understand the risk factors involved with skin cancer, or melanoma in particular. Overexposure to UV light, whether artificial or natural, is the ultimate risk factor for any type of skin cancer, and preventing this risk factor alone could prevent over three million cases of skin cancer each year (AAD, 2016). Another risk '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  9 factor associated with skin cancer is having sunburn at a young age. It is believed that having more than five sunburns before the age of 20 increases the risk of melanoma by 80%, and the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer by 68%; the daily use of sunscreen could reduce melanoma, which as previously stated is the most deadly form of skin cancer, prevalence by almost half (AAD, 2016). While UV exposure and lack of sunscreen use are the most prevalent risk factors, genetic traits could also account for an increased risk of skin cancer. The risk factors associated with skin cancer increase in those who burn easily, have red or blond hair, or a family history of melanoma. As expected, those who have a history of nonmelanoma are more likely to develop melanoma than those who do not have a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (AAD, 2016).  Statistically speaking, the presence of any type of skin cancer is on the rise. According to S. Gandhi (2015),  SCC [squamous cell carcinoma] is the second most common NMSC [nonmelanoma skin cancer] and is increasing in incidence worldwide. A study in Manitoba, Canada revealed a 266% increase in annual incidence in SCC rates in men from 1960 to 2000 and a 215% increase in the incidence rate in women during the same time. Studies estimated the number of new cases in the white population in the United States in 2012 to be between 186,000 and 419,000. (p. 1326) These numbers are astounding and continually increasing. It is vital that there is a shift in focus from skin cancer treatment to practical skin cancer prevention; unfortunately, the reality is that far too many people have already caused unchangeable damage to their skin and will require treatment for their skin cancer during their lifetime.

Buster (2012)  constructed a study that compared skin cancer risk perceptions across ethnicity, age, education, gender and income. Buster reports,  Our analysis indicates that uncertainty and altered or inaccurate perceptions may be more common in the skin cancer risk perceptions of the elderly, ethnic minorities, and those with less education. Elderly subjects perceived their personal skin cancer risk as lower than others their age and reported a lack of clarity on skin cancer prevention strategies they should use. (p. 774) It is interesting to see that skin cancer is most common in the elderly; however according to this study, they reported the highest level of lack of clarity in regards to successful prevention strategies. Lack of education among the population is where health promotion and advocacy play a role in the prevention of skin cancer; without education and promotion of safe practices, the prevalence of preventable diseases will rise. The public health profession needs to target the most affected classes of individuals, such as the elderly, and strongly push an agenda of prevention practice. In 2014, S. Yuce constructed a study that highlighted the prevalence of skin cancer among the elderly: With the increase in lifespan, age related diseases including cancer also increase. With this in mind, in our study we evaluated treatment methods and results of patients who were older than age 65 and operated for skin cancer in the Plastic Surgery Clinic. . . .  Patients older than age 65 who were operated between 2010 and 2014 for skin cancer in the Department of Plastic Surgery were included in our study.

With respect to diagnosis, 58 (63.74%) had basal cell carcinoma, 27 (29.67%) had squamous cell carcinoma, and in 6 (6.59%) patients cutaneous melanoma was detected. A review of surgical operations showed that 22 (24.17%) patients had lesion excision + primary suturation, 19 (20.88%) had lesion excision + graft repair, 48 (52.75%) had lesion excision + local flap repair, and 2 (2.20%) had amputation. . . . In recent years, skin cancer, especially the incidence and mortality of cutaneous melanoma, has been seen more frequently in elders, compared to younger patients. In health controls, the mortality of skin cancer may be reduced by taking into account the geriatric age group. (p. 228) This study showed how geriatric patients are some of the most common skin cancer victims. This is partially due to the nature of skin cancer; skin cancer does not immediately present itself, such as an unhealthy lifestyle and poor diet would soon lead to obesity. Rather, skin cancer often takes years or decades to appear but is often caused during young age.  Another reason that the elderly are a prevalent generation of skin cancer victims is that education and technology has increased since the time that the elderly were young. There is more information today regarding the importance of skin protection than there has been in the past. Because of this, many elderly may have unknowingly caused extensive damage to their skin when they were in their twenties and thirties, and are only now seeing the harm that was caused. For every treatment option, prevention is always the best form of treatment. To a public health promotion advocate, it is vital to stress the importance of skin care at a young age in order to prevent the incidence of melanoma and '),\n",

If the millennial generation understands the importance of skin care and routine skin checks, then prevention will become a common practice among all individuals; skin cancer prevalence and incidence can be reduced instead of constantly increasing.  Skin Cancer is especially prevalent among men in the United States. The CDC produced a graphic showing the number of male individuals by race or ethnicity that were diagnosed with melanoma in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This figure shows that white men are the most susceptible to melanoma, whereas Hispanics and Asians are least likely to develop melanoma. Over time, it appears that melanoma has increased in almost every ethnicity, but especially in white men. The statistics among all races shows an overall increase in melanoma diagnoses over the 14-year period. This increase shows the importance of prevention in all races, not only those who have fair skin, but also in those with heavily pigmented skin.         Figure 1.

Sharpe (2006) reported on skin cancer prevalence related to tanning bed use in the UK. His study concluded that Recent surveys have shown that in man areas children under 16 years of age, boys and girls alike, use these [tanning beds] regularly. There is an urgent need for stricter regulation and enforced age limits on their use. The principles of sun protection, avoiding exposure during the middle part of the day, wearing protective clothing and the proper use of sunscreens, are well known but need to be constantly repeated. The public perception that sunbathing is safe if sunscreens are used is erroneous. With the long delay before the development of skin cancers, there is little prospect for a reduction in skin cancers in the UK in the next 10 years. (p. 333) This conclusion shows that even though individuals know the principles of prevention, they are not properly used and often lead to further long-term skin damage.   The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has provided ample evidence showing the harm, as well as the alarming statistics, of indoor tanning. According to the CDC, 31% of white, high school girls regularly use an indoor tanning bed. The statistics continued to show that 32% of girls aged 18-21 use a tanning bed (CDC, 2016). The CDC explained how indoor tanning exposes individuals to UVA and UVB rays which can both lead to skin cancer, especially in those who began indoor tanning during adolescence or at a young age. Those who began tanning during adolescence have a much higher risk of developing melanoma in adulthood. The CDC reports that indoor tanning is a carcinogenic agent, can cause premature skin aging, and carries the risk of '),\n",

Overall, overexposure to UV light and indoor tanning provide the greatest risk factor, and increase the already present risk, to contracting nonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma in individuals of any descent.   In a letter published by C. Karimkhani (2105) about the dangers of indoor tanning, “Karimkhani and colleagues called on the Surgeon General to announce that indoor ultraviolet (UV) tanning is causally linked to skin cancer, making the analogy to smoking and lung.” (p. 85). It is understood by the general public that smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and Karimkhani presents the idea that the same analogy should be associated with indoor tanning and skin cancer. It is unknown why the Surgeon General has not yet presented this causation; however, it is likely that the association will be made public in the next decade.  Prevention and Screenings  K. Lacy (2013) concluded that “A common factor in all skin malignancies is chronic exposure to UV light. Various public health initiatives have focused on sun safety: current advice is targeted at adequate sun protection with broad spectrum, high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) creams, usually SPF 15-30, particularly for those with fair skin.” (p. 405). M. Linares (2015) mirrors this concept, “The most important risk factor is chronic ultraviolet exposure. Diagnosis is usually suspected in older, fair-skinned individuals with scaly, indurated lesions on sun exposed areas, primarily on the  head and neck” (p. 646). As mentioned multiple times, over exposure to the sun is the leading cause of skin cancer, and can be prevented through proper measures such as '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  15 sunscreen use, avoiding the sun during peak times of the day, routine skin checks, and avoiding the tanning bed. Skin cancer screenings are often overlooked, however, as a measure of prevention, screenings are covered by most insurance companies.   J. Schmitt (2011) performed a study in Germany of the effectiveness of skin cancer screenings in individuals who are 14-34 years old and found that “In 5.5 % of all cases skin cancer screening resulted in the excision of a malignant or atypical melanocytic lesion. It remains unclear what proportion of these cases would have been detected in routine care.” (p. 608). This study shows that routine skin cancer screenings can detect skin cancer prior to the cancer becoming malignant, but often if this is not taken advantage of regularly, excisions must still be performed. K. Ullman (2016) demonstrated a different perspective on this issue; Ullman (2016) stated, “patients and their doctors should decide about screening on the basis of each patient’s specific circumstances” (p. 5). While it is valid that a healthcare treatment course should always be discussed with a physician, the circumstance in which a skin cancer screening would be detrimental to the patient’s health seems rare: T. Kornek (2013) echoes the importance of skin cancer prevention: Due to demographic change, the population is becoming increasingly older both with respect to the overall age distribution as well as to the life expectancy of the individual. To assure a good state of health even at older ages, age preventive measures such as promotion of health and early detection of diseases play an important role. The prevention of skin cancer is of particular significance, as its incidence has risen dramatically in recent decades. (p. 283) '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  16 Again, this reiterates the importance of proper prevention, especially skin cancer screenings, due to the recent increase in skin cancer prevalence. Prevention in Children  Prevention is especially important in young children; being victim of a severe sunburn at a young age automatically increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. M. Masso (2006) published an article about the effects of teaching prevention to children:  Behavior theory suggests that it is easier to learn sun-safe habits early in life than reverse harmful habits later in life. However, the difficulty of attaining effective sun protection in young children that will form the basis of good life-long habits can be gauged from the experience in Australia where many years of educating young children about sun protection has still resulted in a situation where the practices among their adolescent peers are suboptimal and, for some practices, are getting worse. (p. 362) This shows the difficulty of treating proper prevention techniques to children, and thus explains the reason for the dramatic increase in skin cancer prevalence and the need for various treatments of multiple types of skin cancer.  In 2008, K. Hart published an article about the three levels of prevention, specifically in children: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Hart (2008) stated, “Primary school-age children are generally more open and responsive to efforts to increase sun-safe behaviors and improve attitudes toward skin cancer prevention than are older children and adolescents, and because most children spend the majority of the peak hours for ultraviolet radiation at school, primary school instruction on sun-safe behaviors and '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  17 attitudes is a popular method of primary prevention.” (p. 68). This again stresses the importance of prevention in children, seeing as sunburn at a young age can increase the risk of developing skin cancer at an older age.   M. C. Cercato et al. (2008) published an article entitled “Self and Parent-Assessed Skin Cancer Risk Factors in School-Aged Children” that discusses the importance of understanding risk factors in children, since they often are susceptible to spending long hours in the sun, especially during summer vacation. Cercato et al. (2008) state: The incidence of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer is rising in most  countries and sun exposure is recognized as the major environmental risk factor in  fair-skinned people. A meta-analysis on the cutaneous melanoma risk and  ultraviolet sun radiation identified intermittent and intense sun exposure and  history of sunburns, in childhood, in adulthood or over a life-span, as the major  risk factors for melanoma Other factors are family history among first degree  relatives, a high density of freckles, fair hair, eye and skin color, pre-malignant  skin cancer lesions and actinic damage indicators. (p. 133) This statement explains how the incidence of skin cancer, both nonmelanoma and melanoma, is on the rise. Cercato (2008) warns that fair skinned individuals are at a high risk for developing skin cancer in adulthood if they have experienced sunburn as a child Cercato (2008) continues to explain that there are other risk factors involved in developing skin cancer, which include: freckles, light skin tone, light hair and eye color, and family history.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  18  According to the American Cancer Society, there are many ways to treat both nonmelanoma skin cancer and malignant melanoma. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is treated by curettage, Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, or laser therapy (ACC, 2016). Curettage and electrodessication involves removing of the lesion with a sharp instrument, and then applying an electric current to the area to destroy any other cancer cells and to control bleeding. Cryotherapy is a common technique that is performed using liquid nitrogen, which will destroy the cells. Cryotherapy is often used to treat precancerous skin. Laser therapy is used in the same way, except in laser therapy, a high-powered beam is placed on the precancerous skin and kills the abnormal cells on the outer layer of skin. Mohs surgery, commonly known as complete marginal assessment surgery, involves removing pieces of the tumor and viewing the fragments under a microscope until the entire cancer is removed. Typically the best treatment option for diagnosed malignant melanoma would be to excise the area around the malignant growth. In this procedure, a wide excision is performed to remove all abnormal cancerous cells, as well as the normal cells around the cancerous area. If the melanoma progresses to the lymph node, further procedures will be performed which may include radiation and biochemotherapy.   Mohs Surgery, developed in 1938 by Frederic Mohs, is a skilled procedure performed microscopically to treat skin cancer. L. Trost (2011) explained the history of Mohs surgery, as well as how it has continued to evolve up to the present:  Dr. Frederic E. Mohs first conceived of the concepts underlying Mohs  micrographic surgery (MMS) in the 1930’s while he was a Brittingham Research  Assistant to Professor Michael F. Guyer, Chairman of the Department of Zoology  at the University of Wisconsin. They were studying the potential curative effects '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  19  of injecting various substances into different neoplasms. During one experiment, a  20% solution of zinc chloride was injected and inadvertently caused tissue  necrosis. Microscopic analysis showed that the tissue retained its microscopic  structure as if it had been excised and processed for routine pathologic  examination. Dr Mohs realized that this in situ fixation effect could be coupled  with surgical excision to remove neoplasms in a microscopically controlled serial  manner. In addition, he conceived of the idea of using horizontal frozen sections  to evaluate 100% of the specimen margins (deep and peripheral) rather than  traditional vertical sections or random step sections, which examine only 0.01%  of the total surface area of an excised tumor. . . MMS has become the gold  standard for treating many forms of primary and recurrent contiguous skin  cancers and offers the highest cure rates coupled with tissue conservation  compared with other modalities. (p. 135) It is interesting to note that Mohs surgery was not originally accepted by many surgeons, but now it is widely used by many dermatologists as “part of a multidisciplinary approach to treating skin cancer” (Trost, 2011, p. 137). This multidisciplinary approach includes many options for treatment, as well as multiple lines of defense for combatting skin cancer. The first line of defense would be prevention, which includes sunscreen use and avoiding overexposure to the sun. The second line of defense would include skin cancer screenings; skin cancer screenings are important for early detection. Routine skin checks can often prevent the spread and metastasis of skin cancers that may be unknown to the individual. The final line of defense includes a variety of treatment courses, such as laser '),\n",

In the case of combatting skin cancer, prevention is the most logical choice to preventing this disease. Financial Consequences  According to N. Hirst (2012), skin cancer treatments cost an estimated two billion dollars in the United States alone. Hirst performed a study to determine if the overall high cost of skin cancer treatment could be appeased through funding programs to promote sunscreen use; he discovered that active promotion of sunscreen use would be a long-term cost effective investment for individuals and for the government (Hirst, 2012). However, while this may be a wise investment in order to prevent the increase of skin cancer, the prevalence of skin cancer and the economic burden, which it accompanies, is ever increasing. T. Kornek (2013) states: “From a health economic viewpoint, prevention can be viewed as an investment that can minimize potential costs in the future and reduce avoidable disease burden. The benefits of prevention include not only a reduction of costs also a gain in quality of life, functional ability and health” (p. 294). Investing in healthcare is important to avoid the burden caused by diseases. G. Guy (2015) gives an example of how primary prevention can not only reduce incidence of skin cancer, but also of economic burdens:  Primary prevention efforts have been shown to reduce skin cancer incidence, mortality, and healthcare expenditures. For example, the Sunwise Program, a health and environmental education program that teaches children and their caregivers how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun, could avert nearly 11,000 skin cancer cases, while saving $2-$4 in medical care costs and lost productivity for each dollar invested in the program” (Guy, 2015, p. 184).   '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  21 Guy also states that The number of adults treated for skin cancer increased between 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 to nearly 5 million adults annually. Average annual total treatment costs for skin cancer also increased substantially between these periods to $8.1 billion annually. Increased skin cancer treatment costs resulted from an increase in the number of people treated for skin cancer and an increase in per person treatment costs. Annual spending increased more rapidly for skin cancers than for other cancers, suggesting that the economic burden of skin cancer is a particular cause for concern. (p. 184) As Guy (2015) concludes, overexposure to the sun causes damage beyond skin cancer; it also causes a variety of financial burdens in caring for the skin cancer that could have been prevented.  Mortality of Skin Cancer  While there are many therapies and treatments that can be used to try and eliminate melanoma and other skin cancers, they are not always successful. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, approximately 75% of skin cancer deaths are a result of melanoma, which only accounts for less than 1% of all skin cancers. On average one American will die from melanoma each hour of the day, accounting for over 10,000 deaths each year (AAD, 2016). The World Health Organization estimates that 65,000 people die from melanoma each year worldwide; these numbers are astounding seeing that there are ample ways to prevent the cultivation of melanoma. Often times, melanoma is happening when individuals are in their childhood and teenage years, but the effects of their lack of skin care is not seen until they are much older and begin noticing signs of '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\5. Skin Cancer Author Lauren Queen.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='SKIN CANCER  22 aging. Typically, signs of aging, which may include sagging skin, age spots, and wrinkles, are a direct result of overexposure to UV light; often skin damage begins in the adolescent years, and is not recognized until the later in life. This is the sole reason that annual skin checks and self-assessments are so important to the prevention of skin cancer and education about the effects of improper skin care.   There are many facets of skin cancer to consider when studying skin cancer and mortality in ethnic minorities. P. Bradford (2009) claims that “multiple studies have demonstrated 5-year melanoma survival rates of Blacks and Hispanics are consistently lower than those of Caucasians. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics and Blacks tend to present with more advanced, thicker tumors and thus tend to have a poorer prognosis, with higher mortality. (p. 170). It is vital that skin cancer prevention is demonstrated to every race and ethnicity in order to eradicate mortality from a preventable disease; skin cancer prevention is the solution to the total eradication of mortality from skin cancer.  Education and Health Promotion of Skin Cancer Prevention  As previously stated, the most important way to address skin cancer is prevention. Too often, sun damage is done when individuals are in their early teens and twenties, and they do not see the harm that they are doing until much later in life. It is vital that every individual, whether a ten-year-old girl or an 80-year-old man, wears some sort of sunscreen every single day. It is proved that this one action alone can reduce the risk of melanoma by over 50% (AAD, 2016). It could be argued that while skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, it is also the most preventable kind of cancer. While many cancers have to do with genetic mutations, skin cancer simply results from the overexposure to the sun, and the risk could be greatly reduced by applying a sunscreen-'),\n",

Protecting the skin from sunburns, which also leads back to the daily application of sunscreen, can also reduce the risk of skin cancer.   There is an interesting program in place in Australia called SunSmart with promotes prevention. According to G. Guy (2015), The SunSmart public education program promoting sun protection and skin cancer prevention messages through structural, environmental, and legislative initiatives was estimated to save 22,000 life years, while saving approximately $2 for every dollar invested. Reducing indoor tanning, which is associated with an increased risk of NMSC and melanoma is also an important strategy for decreasing the burden of skin cancer. In Australia, it was estimated that stricter indoor tanning regulations, including age restrictions among minors aged 18 years [and younger], could prevent approximately 24 melanoma cases, 226 squamous cell carcinoma cases, and save $256,000 in medical costs per 100,000 persons. (p. 184) This program would be a useful public health method to emulate in the United States; by promotion protection and prevention through specific, effective initiatives, many lives could potential be saved from this preventable disease.  There are three levels to prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary. In the case of skin cancer, primary prevention would involve the daily use of sunscreen and routine skin checks. Secondary prevention would entail cryotherapy and laser therapy to kill precancerous cells. Tertiary prevention would include Mohs surgery and radiation, if necessary. There is somewhat of a gray area between secondary and tertiary prevention, but there is no question that primary prevention is always the best option because it '),\n",

Of all three levels of prevention, primary prevention is the least painful, seeing as sunscreen use causes much less pain than cryotherapy or Mohs surgery. As health promotion advocates, it is so important to stress the necessity of routine skin checks and daily sunscreen use to the population as a whole. As important as sunscreen use and skin checks are to prevention, discouraging the use tanning beds and overexposure to the sun are vital to promoting skin cancer prevention (Narayanan, 2010). As shown, there are various factors in the prevention of skin cancer, which includes education, sunscreen use, regular skin cancer screenings, proper detection, and if necessary, the appropriate treatment course to eliminate the disease. Reducing the prevalence and incidence of a preventable disease first begins with discovering the cause of the disease and then providing the education and promotion necessary to the general public in order to further education and prevent an outbreak.  During the 2004-2005 school year, Y. Gilaberte (2008) and collogues performed a study in Spain about health education for children regarding skin cancer. Although this study was performed more than a decade in the past, their findings about skin cancer education are still relevant today. Their study was outlined as follows:  The incidence of skin cancer is increasing worldwide, and Spain is no exception.  SolSano is the first Spanish health education program for sun safety directed at  elementary school children. The objective was to evaluate SolSano's effects on  students' knowledge, attitudes and practices about sun safety.

Our study demonstrates that significant knowledge can be acquired, attitudes  regarding the healthiness of a tan can be modified and intentions to change sun  protection behavior can be promoted by well-designed educational programs. (p. 209) This study conducted by Gilaberte (2008) shows how important health education is regarding skin cancer, and proves that education can change outcomes. Often time, health promotion seems to not have a lasting effect, but with specific health strategies and cooperation, it is possible to reduce the outcome of skin cancer.   In conclusion, when analyzing the causes, prevention, and treatment of skin cancer, health education and promotion are the most important aspects of prevention. Of all cancers, skin cancer is the one type of cancer that can most easily be prevented; prevention of skin cancer is relatively simple, but often ignored. Since it is estimated that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer during his or her lifetime, and that one person will die from melanoma every hour of the day, advocacy of prevention practices is vital to reducing the number of skin cancer cases every year. Even with sufficient prevention methods, a lack of education and promotion of a practice will not lead to favorable results. Reducing the prevalence and incidence of a preventable disease first begins with discovering the cause of the disease and then providing the education and promotion necessary to the general public.

Data on work-related \\nergonomic and musculoskeletal disorders were collected \\nwith an electronic inquiry, including questions regarding \\nergonomics (position of the screen, high-low table, and \\nergonomic chair), symptoms (neck pain, upper-limb pain), \\nand work-related factors (consecutive working hours a \\nday, average working hours a week).\\nResults: Subjects with the screen on their left had \\nsignificantly more neck pain (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6,  \\np = .0286). Depending on the workspace, high-low tables \\nincreased the chance of developing neck pain (OR = 12.9, \\np = .0246). A screen at eye level caused less neck pain \\n(OR = .22, p = .0610). Employees with a fixed working \\nspace were less susceptible to arm pain (OR = 0.13, p = \\n.0058). The prevalence of arm pain was significantly higher \\nfor the vascular department compared to radiology, urol-\\nogy, and gynecology departments (OR = 9.2, p = .0278).\\nConclusions: Regarding prevention of upper-limb \\npain in ultrasonograph, more attention should be paid to \\nthe work environment and more specialty to the ultra-\\nsound workstation layout. Primary ergonomic prevention \\ncould provide a painless work situation for the ultraso-\\nnographer.\\nApplication: Further research on the ergonomic \\nconditions of ultrasonography is necessary to develop \\nergonomic solutions in the work environment that will \\nhelp to alleviate neck and arm pain.\\nKeywords: ergonomics, musculoskeletal disorders, \\nneck pain\\nIntroductIon\\nIn modern medicine, ultrasonography is an \\nimportant medical diagnostic tool thanks to its \\nnoninvasive and radiation-free character. Dif-\\nferent medical subdisciplines, such as radiology, \\nabdominal surgery, vascular surgery, cardiology, \\nand gynecology, use this technique frequently.\\nThe high prevalence of (low-back pain and) \\nneck pain is causing serious public health prob-\\nlems in Western industrialized countries (Côté  \\net al., 2008; Freburger et al., 2009), with an esti-\\nmated 12-month prevalence of back pain of 44.4% \\nand 28% neck pain in the Netherlands (Picavet & \\nSchouten, 2003). This finding is common among \\nthe working population as well. Neck pain has \\nunfavorable consequences for the individual \\nworker in terms of pain and disability (Côté et al., \\n2008; Henschke et al., 2008) but is also a burden \\nfor society and companies in terms of costs due to \\nmedical health care consumption, work absentee-\\nism, and loss of productivity at work (Dagenais, \\nCaro, & Haldeman, 2008; Lambeek, van Tulder, \\nAnema, Swinkels, & van Mechelen, 2010). Con-\\nsidering this impact, there is an obvious need for \\neffective preventive strategies.\\nPersonal experience teaches us that ultraso-\\nnographers, the people who work with ultra-\\nsound machines, are more predisposed to \\ndevelop neck complaints, potentially in combi-\\nnation with (radiating) pain in the upper limb. \\nHowever, epidemiologic data about this medical \\nproblem are not yet available.\\nThe objective of the present study was to \\ninvestigate the prevalence, severity, and impact \\nof neck pain caused by working with the ultra-\\nsound machine in different medical subdisci-\\nplines by means of an electronic inquiry. This \\nstudy could be the base for further scientific \\ninvestigation.\\nBased on our data, we hope to be able to \\ndevelop custom ergonomic recommendations to \\nreduce the prevalence of neck pain in the ultra-\\nsonographers.\\n547872 HFSXXX10.1177/0018720814547872Human FactorsArm and Neck Pain in Ultrasonographers\\nAddress correspondence to Frank Claes, Physiotherapist, \\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, \\nUniversity Hospital Antwerp, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 \\nEdegem, Belgium; e-mail: frank.claes@uza.be.\\nArm and Neck Pain in Ultrasonographers\\nFrank Claes, University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium, Jan Berger, ZNA \\nStuivenberg, Antwerp, Belgium, and Gaëtane Stassijns, University Hospital \\nAntwerp, Belgium\\nHUMAN FACTORS\\nV ol. 57, No. 2, March 2015, pp. 238\\n \\n–245\\nDOI: 10.1177/0018720814547872\\nCopyright © 2014, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.\\n at GEORGIAN COURT UNIV on March 10, 2015hfs.sagepub.comDownloaded from '),\n",

This contraction is accentuated when \\nthere is also rotation or bending of the neck \\nwhen the computer screen is placed to the side \\nof the worker. The recommended position is in \\nfront of the worker (Cagnie, Danneels, Van Tig-\\ngelen, De Loose, & Cambier, 2007).\\nContinuous rotation of the neck throughout \\nthe working day causes neck pain. It should be \\nanalyzed what the impact is on different struc-\\ntures located in the neck area and which ana-\\ntomic structures are the root cause of the pain \\ndevelopment. In addition, the effect of head \\nrotation, combined with the position of the \\narm, on the development of a specific com-\\nplaint pattern in the upper quadrant should be \\nmonitored.\\nIn our population, only 2 people (1.82%) \\nworked with the screen on their right side. The \\nnumber was too small to be considered in our \\nstatistical analysis.\\n • A  screen at eye level causes less neck pain  \\n(Figure 3).\\nIn the reported literature, there is consensus \\nthat poor ergonomic conditions at workstations \\ncontribute to musculoskeletal symptoms in office \\nworkers (Ariens, Bongers, Hoogendoorn, van \\nder Wal, & van Mechelen, 2002; Gerr, Monteilh, \\n& Marcus, 2006; IJmker et al., 2007). Stud-\\nies have shown that holding the neck in a bent \\nposture and working in the same posture for pro-\\nlonged periods of time were significantly associ-\\nated with neck pain in office workers (Dagenais  \\net al., 2008). Ranasinghe et al. (2011) suggest that \\nmodification of incorrect postures at work and \\nimprovements in the ergonomic designs of work-\\nstations could be important not only as a primary \\npreventive strategy but also as a secondary pre-\\nventive strategy in those with symptoms. Ariens \\net al. (2001) found a trend for a positive relation \\nbetween neck flexion and neck pain, although not \\nsignificant, suggesting an increased risk of neck \\npain for those who spent a large percentage of the \\nworking time with their neck at a minimum of 20° \\nof flexion.\\n • Depending on the workspace, high-low tables \\nincrease the chance of developing neck pain  \\n(Figure 3).\\nTAB le 1: Neck Pain\\nMultiple Logistic Regression\\nVariable Response OR [95% CI] p Value\\nAdjustable examination table Yes + depends on work location vs. no 4.0 [1.2, 12.9] .0196\\nScreen at the left Yes vs. no 3.1 [1.3, 7.3] .0117\\nScreen at eye level Yes vs. no 0.32 [0.09, 1.07] .0647\\nNote.

REULER, MD, Portland\\nLow back pain is one of the most common and costly afflictions of our society. The majority of adults\\nwill have at least one episode of acute low back pain that will likely resolve regardless of treatment.\\nLumbar spine radiographs are overused and there is little scientific support for many of the thera-\\npeutic interventions advocated. Even for those patients with symptomatic.herniated disc, only a\\nsmall fraction will ultimately require surgical intervention.\\n(Reuler J B: Low back pain [Special Article]. West J Med 1985 Aug; 143:259-265)\\n Tow back pain (LBP) is a problem frequently encountered by primary care and emergency room physicians. In the\\nNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, LBP was the\\nnumber one symptomatic complaint expressed by patients 25\\nto 60 years old seeing office-based physicians,I and it is the\\nmost costly medical problem in our society for the age group\\n30 to 60 years.2 Poor understanding of this common syndrome\\nleads to overuse of resources and the prescription of poorly\\nvalidated treatment methods. In this review I will cover those\\naspects of LBP that are germane to an internist's practice and\\nwill discuss surgical intervention only as it pertains to deci-\\nsion-making about referral.\\nEpidemiology\\nLBP is the most common cause of limitation of activity for\\nthose under 45 years of age and is surpassed only by heart\\ndisease, arthritis and rheumatism in the age group 45 to 64\\nyears.3 In all, 60 % to 80 % of the population will experience\\nat least one episode of acute back pain,46 and a prolapsed disc\\nis second only to schizophrenia as the most frequent condition\\nfor which disability payment is allowed by the Social Security\\nAdministration in those under 40 years of age.'\\nLBP represents a major issue for industry, where it is\\nsecond only to upper respiratory illness in accounting for lost\\ntime from work-93 million days annually.8 In the state of\\nOregon, the back was the injured body part in 31 % of all\\nclaims accepted by Workers' Compensation, a frequency 2.5\\ntimes greater than that of any other body area.9 Of such inju-\\nries, 75% involve the age group 20 to 44 years and the\\naverage amount of time lost from work is 14 days.\\nVocational factors implicated in workplace-related back\\npain include physically heavy work, static work positions\\nsuch as sitting and driving, frequent bending and twisting,\\nlifting and forceful movements, repetitive work and vibra-\\ntion.8'l0'1' At the Kodak Company, back pain developed in\\n35 % of sedentary workers and 47 % of manual material hand-\\nlers, with only 15% of cases being related to a definite12\\ninjury.\\nBiomechanics\\nThe lumbar spine consists of a series of motion units each\\nhaving an anterior and posterior segment. The anterior seg-\\nment, composed of two vertebral bodies and the intervertebral\\ndisc, bears weight and absorbs shock.4 The posterior seg-\\nment, consisting of the vertebral arches, transverse and spi-\\nnous processes and the inferior and superior articular facets,\\nprotects the neural structures and directs movement of the unit\\nin flexion and extension. The disc is composed of the nucleus\\npulposus and a circumferential, intertwining fibroelas-\\ntic mesh, the annulus fibrosus, which attaches to the vertebral\\nbodies and permits a rocker motion. The unit is stabilized by a\\nseries of ligaments that minimize shearing forces and the\\nparavertebral muscle bundles that provide balance for the\\nstatic spine and strength for the kinetic spine.\\nSeveral factors relate to the stress on the motion unit. Disc\\npressure reflects the response to shearing and rotational loads,\\nabdominal cavity pressure supports the trunk anteriorly and\\nthe myoelectric back muscle activity balances the gravita-\\ntional forces in upright posture and forward flexion. Using\\nintradiscal pressure measurements, Nachemson has shown\\nmarked variations in forces in various positions and activi-\\nties.13'14 For example, when a person is lying supine in the\\nsemi-Fowler position, a force of 100 Newtons is exerted on\\nthe L-3 disc. A person sitting upright without support gener-\\nates seven times this force and when the same person bends\\nforward and rotates while holding a 10-kg weight, the force\\nincreases 20-fold.\\nCauses of Low Back Pain\\nThough most patients experiencing LBP will have benign,\\nnonemergent mechanical problems for which specific diag-\\nnoses will not be made, it is imperative to consider other\\nAUGUST 1985 * 143 * 2\\nFrom the Division of General Medicine, Department of Medicine, The Oregon Health Sciences University, and the Ambulatory Care and Medical Services, Veterans\\nAdministration Medical Center, Portland.\\nReprints are not available.\\n259\"),\n",

These may be\\nclassified as infectious (pyogenic osteomyelitis, epidural ab-\\nscess), inflammatory (spondyloarthropathy), metabolic (os-\\nteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget\\'s disease), neoplastic\\n(metastatic, primary cord tumor) and visceral (abdominal\\naortic aneurysm, urinary tract infection, pancreatic dis-\\nease). 15\\'16 It is not within the scope of this review to address\\nevery potential cause of back pain, but selective entities rep-\\nresenting common problems or areas of confusion are high-\\nlighted below.\\nIntervertebral Disc Disease\\nThough most structures in the back have been assigned\\nroles in the causation of back pain, the disc has been impli-\\ncated, at least indirectly, as the primary agent. Among rea-\\nsons are the observations that true herniation is preceded by\\nattacks of back pain, intradiscal injection reproduces pain and\\nthe anatomic changes in the disc and annular ruptures are first\\nseen at younger ages, the same time that LBP becomes a\\nclinical problem. 17\\nAt autopsy, herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is seen in\\n15 % to 30% of specimens and degenerative changes are ob-\\nserved in the motion segments of all persons over the age of 60\\nyears.18 19 With age, the meshwork of the annulus becomes\\nfibrotic, lessening the recoil properties of the hydraulic mech-\\nanism. These changes, coupled with microscopic fracturing\\nof the end plates and facets, reduce the overall torsional\\nstrength of the unit and its capacity to absorb energy. Al-\\nthough pain produced by true herniation impinging on the\\nnerve root is easily understood, the role of the changing me-\\nchanical behavior of the disc, the alteration of the height and\\nprotrusion of the disc on other sensitive tissues is not well\\ndefined vis-\\'a-vis LBP. These age-related degenerative\\nchanges are often present in the absence of LBP.\\nHNP is generally a disorder of younger people, most fre-\\nquently involving the L5-S1 and L4-5 discs.20\"21 The classic\\nsyndrome contains the following features: leg pain is domi-\\nnant, unilateral and in a sciatic distribution, often aggravated\\nby coughing, sneezing and forward flexion; paresthesias are\\nlocalized to a dermatomal distribution; positive tension signs\\nare present, including straight-leg raising, crossed-\\nstraight-leg raising and bowstring; at least two neurologic\\nsigns are demonstrable, including muscle wasting, motor\\nweakness, diminished sensation and diminished reflex, and a\\ncontrast study will be positive for disc herniation at a level\\ncorresponding to the clinical features.22 Table 1 lists the find-\\nings in the three commonly encountered disc syndromes.\\nSeveral pitfalls are inherent in the diagnosis of HNP.\\nOther disorders may mimic some of the above features, and\\nthe straight-leg raising test, or one of its variants, manifested\\nby radicular leg (not back) pain upon passive stretching of the\\nsciatic nerve, is not specific to HNP. Though virtually all\\npatients under age 30 with a symptomatic herniation will have\\na positive straight-leg raising (true-positive) test result, the\\nmajority of patients with a positive test do not have a disc\\nherniation (false-positive).2\" Additionally, older patients\\nwith confirmed herniation or those with higher root lesions\\n(above L5 root) may have negative straight-leg raising test\\nresults (false-negative). The neurologic findings should be\\nused as guidelines only in identifying the level of involve-\\nment, because overlap in innervation may lead to misinterpre-\\n(~ti6iiTThe sensory examination must be mapped carefully to\\nf distinguish dermatomal from nondermatomal impairments.\\nAnkylosing Spondylitis\\nAnkylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory arthropathy\\nwith a strong predominance in men, has an age distribution\\nsimilar to that of HNP and mechanical LBP.23 Suggestive\\nhistorical features are an age of onset of less than 40 years,\\ninsidious onset, duration longer than three months, morning\\nstiffness and improvement with exercise. Positive responses\\nto four of these features have a 95% sensitivity and 85%\\nsensitivity for the disease.24 A past history of iritis would\\nfurther heighten suspicion. Maneuvers to assess spinal mo-\\nbility, chest expansion and sacroiliac joint tenderness may be\\nuseful,25 though in a recent series these tests did not have any\\nclinical value in helping to distinguish between ankylosing\\nspondylitis and noninflammatory back disorders.26 The diag-\\nnosis is confirmed by plain radiographs of the sacroiliac joints\\nthat show bilateral sclerosis. In most instances, a single an-\\nteroposterior view of the pelvis will demonstrate the abnor-\\nmalities by the tirne the patient first seeks medical attention.\\nNuclide scintigraphy and computed tomography have been\\nreported to be useful in reaching a diagnosis in suspected\\ncases when plain films are not yet abnormal, but their oper-\\nating characteristics remain to be defined. Though results of\\nthe human leukocyte antigen B27 study are positive in 90 % of\\nwhite Americans with primary ankylosing spondylitis, the\\ntest does not confirm or exclude the presence of the syndrome,\\nthe diagnosis of which must be based on radiographic find-\\nings.27 Exercises and anti-inflammatory drugs are the main-\\nstays of therapy.\\nFacet Arthropathy\\nThe lumbar zygapophyseal (facet) joints, located poste-\\nrior to the plane of the intertransverse ligament and innervated\\nby the dorsal primary ramus of the spinal nerve, have been\\nTHE WESTERN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE260\\n'),\n",

Physical findings\\nare limited to tenderness over the facet joints magnified by\\nhyperextension. Intraarticular facet block done with fluoro-\\nscopic guidance may confirm the diagnosis and injection may\\nprovide relief in selected patients.29\\'30\\nSpinal Stenosis\\nThe term spinal stenosis includes narrowing of the spinal\\ncanal, nerve root canals and intervertebral foramina, all of\\nwhich cause nerve root entrapment.3\" All forms of stenosis\\nare characterized by a shallow lateral recess, that area bor-\\ndered anteriorly by the vertebral body, laterally by the pedicle\\nand posteriorly by the superior articular facet.32 Those with\\nthe spinal stenosis syndrome experience back pain, transient\\nmotor deficits, tingling and intermittent pain in one or both\\nlegs, worsened by standing or walking (neurogenic claudica-\\ntion) and relieved by sitting or squatting, in contradistinction\\nto HNP. Objective neurologic signs are absent at rest but may\\nbe present upon examination after exercise. 33\\'34 The diagnosis\\nmay be confirmed by a computed tomographic (CT) scan and,\\nin some patients, symptoms may be relieved by surgical cor-\\nrection.34\\'35\\nMyofascial Syndromes\\nMyofascial pain syndromes arise from trigger points,\\nfocal areas of hyperirritability located in skeletal muscle and\\nfascia which, when palpated, produce referred pain to distant\\nsites.36 The characteristics of trigger points have been delin-\\neated and the resultant syndromes causing LBP, including the\\nquadratus lumborum, iliolumbar and piriformis syndromes,\\nhave been described.3\\'4\\' Pain and weakness are elicited by\\nmaneuvers that cause the involved muscle to contract. Effec-\\ntive treatment may result from application of vapocoolant\\nspray, injection of local anesthetic into the trigger point or\\nischemic compression of the area.36\\nFibrositis, a related and common form of nonarticular\\nrheumatism, is characterized by ill-defined musculoskeletal\\npain-often worsened by stress, cold and exercise-depres-\\nsion, nonrestorative sleep, chronic fatigue and early morning\\nstiffness, and a physical examination will show no abnormali-\\nties except for tender spots located over muscles and ligamen-\\ntous bony insertions.42 43 The cause of the syndrome is\\nunknown and its effective treatment is difficult. Antidepres-\\nsants, centrally acting muscle relaxants and local injections\\nmay be of benefit.\\nClinical Evaluation\\nThe evaluation of LBP focuses on the differential diag-\\nnosis discussed above. Known malignancy, a history of intra-\\nvenous drug abuse and constitutional symptoms such as\\nanorexia, weight loss and fevers suggest metastatic cancer,\\nvertebral osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. Inquiry about\\nother organ-specific symptoms may uncover a nonmechanical\\ncause of LBP, particularly urinary tract infection.16 Age\\ngreater than 60 years and corticosteroid use have associated\\nosteopenia and resultant compression fractures as a cause of\\nLBP. The character of the pain pattern may suggest one of the\\nsyndromes discussed above, and bowel, bladder or sexual\\ndysfunction may be clues to central midline disc herniation,\\ncarcinomatous extradural cord compression or cord tumor. A\\npast history of LBP and related interventions, disabilities and\\nlitigation aid in placing the problem in perspective and plan-\\nning a management strategy.\\nThe physical examination should include observation of\\ngait, trunk mobility and deformities and inequality of leg\\nlengths.2\\' In addition to a detailed neuromuscular examina-\\ntion, abdominal and vascular evaluations should be included,\\nparticularly in the elderly and those with symptoms sug-\\ngesting neurogenic claudication. Localization of trigger\\npoints may lead to immediate therapeutic intervention.\\nLumbar Spine Radiography\\nLBP is the most frequent symptom leading to diagnostic\\nroentgenograms in an ambulatory care setting, with an esti-\\nmated 7 million films done annually in the United States at a\\ncost of $350 to $500 million.44\\'45 Lumbosacral radiography is\\nthe largest contributor to gonadal irradiation and, unfortu-\\nnately, the majority of specific findings (osteophytes, nar-\\nrowed disc space, spondylolisthesis) do not correlate with the\\npresence of LBP or predict its cause.46 LaRocca and Macnab\\nshowed that only 7 % of 150 asymptomatic laborers over the\\nage of 35 years had normal radiographs and that the preva-\\nlence of degenerative changes (84 %), congenital anatomic\\nvariations (64%) or both (57%) was comparable to a similar\\ngroup with LBP.4\\'\\nLiang and Komaroff, applying a formal decision analysis,\\ncompared a strategy that included radiographs on the first\\nvisit for acute, uncomplicated LBP with one in which films\\nwere delayed four to eight weeks.48 Using prior probabilities\\nof diseases causing LBP that could be diagnosed radiographi-\\ncally (disc space infection, osteomyelitis) and for which a\\nspecific treatment was available, the former strategy led to a\\ndecrease in suffering of only 58 minutes while generating a\\ntenfold increase in cost and radiation exposure. Clinical\\nstudies have confirmed the conclusion that lumbosacral spine\\nroentgenograms are of negligible diagnostic value in other-\\nwise healthy patients with LBP under age 60 unless major\\ndirect spinal trauma, malignancy or infection is a concern or\\nthe pain has persisted for more than six to eight\\nweeks.\\'6\\'44\\'49\\'50 The benefit of having oblique lumbar radi-\\nographs in addition to a single frontal and lateral view is\\nnegligible.44\\'45\\nManagement of Acute LBP\\nAcute LBP is a self-limited disorder, with 50% of patients\\npain-free by one week, 80% by two weeks and 90% by eight\\nweeks regardless of therapy.5\\' Although innumerable thera-\\npeutic modalities have been advocated, the rate of sponta-\\nneous resolution, the diverse causes of LBP and the difficulty\\nin measuring the symptom, pain, represent problems in evalu-\\nating efficacy of a given therapy.52-54 Deyo has recently re-\\nviewed these methodologic pitfalls.55\\nThe supine position maintained during bed rest has a theo-\\nretical advantage for instances of disc protrusion, considering\\ndisc pressure measurements discussed above. 14 Whether bed\\nrest is useful in other causes of LBP is even less clear. Bed rest\\nfor 7 to 14 days, using a firm mattress and keeping hips and\\nknees flexed, is an appropriate trial, acknowledging that the\\nrecommendations for duration are entirely empirical.2 \\'56\\nAUGUST 1985 * 143 * 2 261'),\n",

Lifting, bending and pro-\\nlonged sitting should be avoided.\\nBecause postulated mechanisms for LBP of soft tissue or\\ndisc origin implicate an inflammatory response, an anti-in-\\nflammatory agent is recommended. None of the nonsteroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs has been shown to be more effective\\nthan aspirin and all are more expensive.2''51'55 5'758 Antispas-\\nmodics and muscle relaxants probably act more by a sedative\\neffect than at a specific neuromuscular site, are expensive\\nand, again, none has been shown to be clearly efficacious.59 65\\nIn addition to aspirin in therapeutic doses and bed rest, we\\nrecommend local heat, using a moist, hot towel, or cold appli-\\ncations, using a small wet towel placed in the freezer until\\nmalleable; these are simple adjuncts having theoretical sup-\\nport.6668 The traditional traction apparatus using small\\nweights does little more than keep the patient in bed, because\\nit has been shown that at least 25 % of body weight must be\\napplied to even begin to lower intradiscal pressure.21'51'55\\nSpinal manipulation, of which several methods are used, has\\nalso not been proved to be effective.21 69-71 Most important is\\nreassuring the patient that LBP is generally self-limited and\\nthe prognosis for return to usual activities is good.\\nSurgical Procedures\\nFailure of a conservative therapeutic program for acute\\nback pain frequently leads primary care providers to consider\\northopedic or neurosurgical referral. Unfortunately, expecta-\\ntions of the referring physician and patient are often unreal-\\nistic with respect to the success of surgical treatment for\\nsymptomatic HNP. Though details of various surgical proce-\\ndures for the lumbar spine are not germane to this review, an\\nunderstanding of the natural history of conservatively treated\\nand surgically treated disc disease is important.\\nIn general, acute cauda equina syndrome and major or\\nprogressive paralysis represent clear indications for surgical\\nintervention.21 Other indications are relative, and patient se-\\nlection remains a most important determinant of outcome of\\nsurgical therapy.21'2'3 Operative procedures should be re-\\nserved for patients with symptoms of sciatica and neurolog-\\nical findings on examination, who have continued problems\\nafter 6 to 12 weeks of conservative therapy.21'74 The goals of\\noperations for HNP are to relieve sciatic and low back pain\\nand to improve physiologic function, employment status, so-\\ncial functioning and the ability to perform activities of daily\\nliving.21 The younger the patient and the greater the degree of\\nherniation seen during the surgical procedure, the more likely\\nit is that the pain will be relieved. Complete relief of back and\\nsciatic pain occurs in approximately 60% of operative pa-\\ntients, with sciatic pain being relieved more frequently than\\nback pain.75 However, long-term follow-up of patients with\\nsciatica and neurological findings who did not undergo sur-\\ngical procedures showed that 52% were without symptoms\\nand an additional 27 % had only mild symptoms. 76 Work ca-\\npacity and activity restriction were also similar in surgically\\nversus conservatively treated groups.76 Additionally, up to\\n10% of patients having operations for classic, severe sciatica\\nwill have a negative exploration.75 This group has the worst\\nprognosis. In general, only about 20% of patients with herni-\\nated nucleus pulposus require surgical intervention.21 Indica-\\ntions for chymopapain injection are similar to those for\\nsurgical intervention.22.77-79 Response to injection may not be\\ncomplete for up to six weeks, and failure of chymopapain\\ntherapy does not obviate a subsequent operation. The refer-\\nring physician, surgeon and patient must discuss the expecta-\\ntions of surgical intervention and the limitations and risks of\\nthe planned procedure .80\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nIf it is agreed that an operation should be offered to and\\naccepted by the patient, further diagnostic studies are indi-\\ncated, remembering that up to 30% of asymptomatic persons\\nhave myelographically proved disc herniations.72'81 It is im-\\nportant to do further studies because the correlation between\\nthe predicted level of herniation based upon neurological defi-\\ncits on examination and the level of herniation on study is only\\n50% to 60%.\\nMuch controversy exists today as to whether metrizamide\\nmyelography or computed tomography is the method of\\nchoice to establish the diagnosis and location of lumbar disc\\nherniation.82 Myelography permits direct visualization of the\\nlumbar and sacral nerve rootlets. It is often difficult, however,\\nfor the myelographer to distinguish between a bulging disc,\\nwhich does not cause nerve root compression, and a herniated\\ndisc. Also, symptomatic lateral herniations, particularly at\\nthe L5-S1 level, may be missed with myelography.83'84\\nWith high-resolution CT scanners, a noninvasive diag-\\nnosis of HNP is possible. In series comparing CT with myelo-\\ngraphy in evaluating HNP in patients who underwent surgical\\nexploration, CT has been shown to be of equal accuracy.84'85\\nCT is particularly useful in evaluation of the vertebral bodies,\\nposterior elements and paravertebral soft tissue mass and is\\nthe most precise method for assessing spinal stenosis. Also,\\nCT is more accurate in detecting lateral herniations.84 How-\\never, other extradural processes, such as scars, masses and\\nspondylosis, may mimic focal disc protrusion and, as in mye-\\nlography, it may be difficult to distinguish true herniation\\nfrom a bulging disc.\\nPresently, the choice of initial diagnostic method for eval-\\nuation of HNP remains one of opinion. Review of the clinical\\ninformation with the radiological and surgical consultants is\\nimportant in determining a diagnostic strategy. An unequivo-\\ncally abnormal or unequivocally normal CT scan may obviate\\nthe need for myelography unless the clinical evaluation con-\\ntradicts the CT findings.84 If neither the CT scan nor the\\nmyelogram provide a satisfactory answer, CT and metriza-\\nmide myelography done concomitantly may give additional\\nclarification of the anatomy.\\nIn difficult situations where a strong functional component\\nappears to be present in patients with symptoms and signs\\nsuggesting nerve root compression, differential spinal anes-\\nthesia may be useful. This procedure consists of an injection\\nof saline followed by injection of increasing concentrations of\\nprocaine hydrochloride into the subarachnoid space, causing\\nsympathetic, sensory and motor blockage. If pain is relieved\\nwith saline or not relieved despite administration of 1 % pro-\\ncaine hydrochloride, a strong psychological component to the\\npain problem is suggested.21\\nManagement of Chronic LBP\\nThe management of a patient with chronic LBP is often a\\nvexing problem for physicians.86 These patients often fall into\\nTHE WESTERN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE262\"),\n",

As in other non-\\nmalignant chronic pain syndromes, narcotic analgesics are to\\nbe avoided and alternative therapeutic modalities have been\\nused, including biofeedback, acupuncture, transcutaneous\\nnerve stimulation, implanted neurostimulators and ablative\\nneurosurgical procedures, all with varying success and all\\nfraught with methodologic problems.55 For selected patients,\\ntrigger-point injections may provide relief. In smaller subsets\\nof patients, epidural corticosteroids87-89 and corsets or brac-\\nes21\\'5155 may be beneficial.\\nFor most patients, however, there is little specific that one\\ncan offer. Although psychological profiling may be of some\\nuse in predicting responses to surgical intervention,90\\'91 it is\\ncounterproductive to attempt to assign patients to organic or\\npsychogenic categories.86\\'91\\'92 In contradistinction to the dis-\\nease model, the learning model, in which illness is comprised\\nprimarily of behavior and chronicity insures the need for\\nbehavior change, provides a more rational view of the chronic\\npain syndrome.93 It can be assumed that the longer the patient\\nhas pain, the more the psychological factors become impor-\\ntant in influencing neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying\\npain behavior. In this context, symptoms are to the disease\\nmodel as behavior is to the learning model. Using scales of\\nreliability such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In-\\nventory does not help to distinguish patients with organic or\\npsychological pain. Both groups have increased scores for\\nhypochondriasis, depression and hysteria indistinguishable\\nfrom those of psychoneurotic patients.86 These observations\\nunderscore the point that it matters little whether or not pain is\\nreal, but identifying those factors that influence pain is crit-\\nical. The concept of chronic pain programs utilizes the princi-\\nples of behavior modification, with goals being to identify\\nand eliminate positive reinforcers for pain behavior, increase\\nphysical activity and decrease drug usage. These programs\\nrequire commitment and motivation on the part of the patient\\nand family and considerable financial expenditure. The\\nlong-term results of such programs vary.94 95\\nFor most patients with chronic LBP, education and an\\nexercise program are the foundations of successful therapy.Exercises, which may begin after the acute exacerbation\\nabates, aim to minimize lumbar lordosis, thereby decreasingsubluxation of the overriding facet joints, to decrease\\nshearing stresses, to widen the intervertebral foramina and to\\nstrengthen abdominal and spinal musculature. Several types\\nhave been advocated, including extension and lumbar iso-\\nmetric flexion exercises, but no single program has clear su-\\nperiority over another.4\\'96-\\'98 One of the most successful and\\nwidely available back programs is the Young Men\\'s Christian\\nAssociation\\'s Healthy Back Program.99 This course, offered\\nthroughout the United States, consists of six weeks of twice-\\na-week sessions, each of which include relaxation exercises\\nand an increasing sequence of limbering, strengthening and\\nstretching exercises. The charge is nominal, and the skills\\nlearned are continued at home indefinitely to minimize\\nchronic pain and prevent acute attacks of LBP. The details\\nhave recently been published in an inexpensive book.100\\nDisability\\nBecause LBP is such an important malady in the work-\\nplace, the issues of disability and compensation frequently\\narise. \\'0 The statutory definitions of a compensable personal\\ninjury are that it was out of, and in the course of, employment\\nand occurred accidentally. 102 In most cases, physicians have\\nno role in these decisions except in clear instances of extreme\\nforce or overt trauma, a small fraction of the occupationally\\nrelated LBP. A physician may attend to the degree and nature\\nof the impairment-that is, an objective assessment of ana-\\ntomical or functional loss. However, there are often no objec-\\ntive means by which to assess many forms of impairment,\\nparticularly in LBP, and to establish the point at which\\nhealing is complete. 103 Disability, the loss of capacity to en-\\ngage in gainful employment owing to the impairment, is in\\nlarge measure behavioral and its determination is an admin-\\nistrative decision. 103-105 Hadler has reviewed the major points\\nof interpretation of Workers\\' Compensation Law as related to\\nLBP. 102\\nPrevention\\nGiven the staggering costs in dollars and reduced produc-\\ntivity resulting from LBP, prevention must be a major focus.\\nPre-employment screening by x-ray studies is not useful for\\nidentifying workers at high risk. 106* 107 A history of prior LBP,\\nhowever, and inability to demonstrate an isometric lifting\\nstrength equal to that required for a worker\\'s job may have\\ngreater predictive value.108-110 The study of ergonomics, the\\nscience of energy utilization in the workplace, has led to\\nrecommendations that minimize risk of back injury, including\\nuse of substitution devices, such as hoists, cranes and dollies,\\nimproved equipment and task designs to decrease vibration\\nand stress and variation of work practices. 111 These principles\\nhave also been incorporated into car seats, furniture and lei-\\nsure-time equipment design.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

Besides this diversity, in every recording of ventilation at rest in steady-state condition breath-to-\\nbreath ﬂuctuations are observed in ventilatory variables. This variability is non random and may be explained either\\nby a central neural mechanism or by instability in the chemical feedback loops. Beyond this variability, each\\nindividual appears to select one particular pattern among the inﬁnite number of possible combination of ventilatory\\nvariables and airﬂow proﬁle. This one particular pattern appears to be a relatively stable characteristic of an adult\\nindividual being reproducible in several conditions and above all, after a long period of time.

In addi-\\ntion, they have the merit of being obtained by\\nobservation and thus not being altered by the use\\nof any measuring device.\\nThe large range of breathing frequencies ob-\\nserved in human subjects at rest led to a search to\\ndetermine an optimal breathing frequency.\\nWhichever the variable to be minimized, it ap-\\npears that, at rest, a large range of frequencies\\nfulﬁl the optimization criterion. Several studies\\nhave examined this problem, a documented analy-\\nsis of which is given by Poon (1991).\\n1.2. Inspiratory and expiratory duration\\nThe inspiratory and expiratory durations intro-\\nduce an additional factor of diversity into the\\nbreathing pattern. For a given duration of res-\\npiratory cycle (TTOT) there may be several combi-\\nnations of inspiratory (T I) and expiratory (T E)\\ntimes within, however, the constraint that T I is\\nless than T E (TI BTE).\\n1.3. Tidal 6olume\\nThe diversity in tidal volume was ﬁrst described\\nby Dejours et al. (1961), the range of V T observed\\nin human subjects at rest being from 442 to 1549\\nml. These values were neither related to the height\\nof the subjects, the vital capacity, FEV1, nor to\\nthe inspiratory and expiratory resistances.\\nThe devices used for measuring V T have been\\nblamed for introducing errors not only in the\\nvalues of VT but also in the values of timing\\ncomponents of the breathing pattern. However,\\nthese errors appear to affect only the base line\\nvalues and not the range of the diversity. Indeed,\\nin one of the most recent studies (Perez and\\nTobin, 1985) conducted on 16 subjects the\\nmean9S.D. values of the respiratory variables\\nremained approximately the same whatever the\\ninstrumentation used for recording breathing.\\n1.4. VT:TI and T I:TTOT\\nThe drive and timing components of ventilation\\nintroduced by Milic-Emili and Grunstein (1976),\\nare widely used because of their physiological\\nsigniﬁcance and relevance. However, being ratios,\\nthe diversity in their values may be reduced if\\nboth terms of the ratio vary in the same direction\\nor, alternatively, may derive from the diversity of\\none or both of the ratio terms. Thus, they are not\\nthe most adequate descriptors of the diversity of\\nthe breathing pattern. Indeed, Proctor and Hardy\\n(1949) reported that there were global qualitative\\ndifferences in the breathing pattern between peo-\\nple but that single measurement of slopes, ratios\\nor instantaneous ﬂows failed to yield signiﬁcant\\ndifferences between people. Benchetrit et al.\\n(1989) showed that when comparing breathing\\npattern at rest, the ensemble (VT,T I and TE) may\\nbetter characterize a pattern than any of the tradi-\\ntionally used single respiratory variables VT,T I,\\nTE or the ratios V T:TI and T I:TTOT.\\n1.5. Flow proﬁle\\nVery shortly after the publication of Der Pneu-\\nmotachograms by Fleisch, Bretschger (1925) ana-\\nlyzed and classiﬁed patterns of pneumo-\\ntachograms and concluded that the optimal\\nairﬂow pattern minimizing mechanical work is\\nrectangular with constant airﬂow rates during in-\\nspiration and expiration.\\nFollowing Bretschger’s (Bretschger, 1925) study\\nthe hypothesis of an optimal ﬂow shape has been\\nconsidered by several authors. An analysis of\\nthese studies and models is given by Ha¨ma¨la¨inen\\n(1983). In addition to the mechanical work, work\\nrate, mean squared volume acceleration, average\\npressure, are among the minimization criteria\\nused. The rectangular or parabolic airﬂow curves\\npredicted by these models are not close to the\\nobserved patterns of breathing at rest, although\\nbreathing patterns in exercise, are indeed, of the\\nrectangular type. Thus, the related criteria are not\\nable to explain individual variations in breathing\\npattern nor can they predict effects of added\\nexternal loads. The ﬂow proﬁle was also analyzed\\nto determine, as in Proctor and Hardy (1949)\\nsubtitle to their article, the signiﬁcance of the\\nnormal pneumotachogram. The quantitative anal-\\nysis performed by these authors, include measure-\\nments of acceleration, velocity and time'),\n",

One of the possi-\\nble explanations they proposed was that ‘the\\nmethods of quantitative analysis may not include\\nthe fundamental characteristics of the pattern.\\nPerhaps an analysis of the total shape of the curve\\nis required’. Gray and Grodins (1951) have fur-\\nther proposed that transformation of the tracings\\nto a completely non-dimensional form should be\\nthe ﬁrst step in analyzing the signiﬁcance of their\\nshape as far as no two respiratory cycles yield\\nidentical curves with respect to both shape and\\ndimensions. Such methods of global ﬂow proﬁle\\nanalysis have been proposed by several authors\\n(Bachy et al., 1986; Painter et al., 1987; Sato and\\nRobbins, 1998). These methods provide the possi-\\nbility of obtaining mean ﬂow proﬁles under differ-\\nent conditions and of comparing resting and\\nstimulated patterns.\\n2. Breath-to-breath variations in the pattern of\\nbreathing\\nPriban (1963) was the ﬁrst to demonstrate that\\nthe breath-to-breath ﬂuctuations in respiratory\\ncycle variables were not purely random. He con-\\ncluded that, ‘‘it is not unlikely that some system\\nwould be able to compare one breath to its prede-\\ncessor and adjust it or the following one with\\nrespect to frequency and volume and so produce\\nthe observed pattern of breathing’’.\\nUsing mainly time-series analyses and statistical\\nmodels, several studies conﬁrmed the non random\\nnature of the ﬂuctuations of the ventilatory vari-\\nables and showed that there was a signiﬁcant\\npositive autocorrelation betweenXn and Xn\\x1c1, Xn\\nbeing the generic term of a series of V T or T TOT\\n(Benchetrit and Pham Dinh, 1974; Gallego et al.,\\n1985), TI or TE (Bolton and Marsh, 1984), V TI or\\nVTE (Busso et al., 1996). The simplest autoregres-\\nsive model proposed was:\\n(Xn \\x1cX)\\x1ea(Xn\\x1c1 \\x1cX)\\x1bon\\nwhere, X is the mean value of the series, a is a\\nconstant and o is the disturbance and should be\\npositive, negative or nil.\\nIn order to identify the system that is ‘able to\\ncompare’ and to specify the structure of interrela-\\ntionships within and between cycle’s variables\\nrecordings were made under various conditions.\\nAutocorrelation function were calculated while\\nbreathing different gas mixtures, air; hypoxic\\n(FIO2\\n\\x1e0.14); hyperoxic (F IO2\\n\\x1e1.0) and hyper-\\ncapnic (FICO2\\n\\x1e0.03), it was found that there were\\nno signiﬁcant differences between these conditions\\nfor a given subject and also there were no signiﬁ-\\ncant differences in the autocorrelation coefﬁcients\\nbetween subjects for a given gas mixture\\n(Benchetrit, 1976). Modarreszadeh et al. (1990)\\nreported a similar autoregressive structure for VI,\\nTI and not for T E during stage II sleep. Liang et\\nal. (1996) observed that at constant end tidal PO2\\nand PCO2\\nthe breath-to-breath variations in venti-\\nlation were not random and that the autocorrela-\\ntion in the sequence can usefully be described by\\na simple autoregressive model.\\nIn addition to these studies on human subjects,\\nanimal experiments were performed to clarify the\\nmechanisms contributing to the breath-to-breath\\ncorrelations seen in respiratory cycle characteris-\\ntics. Whether the dependency between the charac-\\nteristics of successive breaths resides solely in a\\ncentral neural mechanism or results in part from\\ninstability in the chemical feedback loop is still\\nmatter of debate.\\nIt is noteworthy that breath-to-breath depen-\\ndency in respiratory variables suggested to Priban\\nand Fincham (1965) that the respiratory con-\\ntroller may be an adaptive or a self-optimizing\\nsystem which predicts the activity which will keep\\nthe performance of the respiratory system at its\\nminimum, the prediction being conditioned by the\\nresponse of the system during previous breaths.\\n3. Individuality of breathing pattern\\nThe existence of the individuality of the breath-\\ning pattern has been observed by all the investiga-\\ntors who have had to perform several recordings\\non one subject. Thus, from the observation of\\npneumotachograms, Proctor and Hardy (1949)\\nreported that ‘‘the comparison of consecutive cy-\\ncles or cycles taken on different days from records'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\breathingPatterns.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='G. Benchetrit : Respiration Physiology 122 (2000) 123–129126\\non any single subject impresses one with the con-\\nsistency with which an individual pattern is repro-\\nduced’’. Morrow and Vosteen (1953) conﬁrmed\\nthese observations and even suggested that sub-\\njects could be identiﬁed from ‘gross judgment’ of\\nthe pneumotachogram. It was Dejours et al.,\\n(1961) who introduced the concept of ‘la person-\\nnalite´ ventilatoire’, claiming that different people\\nbreathe in different ways in terms of tidal volume,\\nrespiratory frequency and airﬂow shape, and that\\nthis is a relatively stable characteristic of an adult\\nindividual. In addition, Golla and Antonovich\\n(1929) found that some normal subjects had ha-\\nbitually a regular breathing pattern whilst others\\na habitually irregular one. We have also observed\\n(unpublished observation) this phenomenon and\\nfound that the regular or irregular breathing pat-\\ntern was reproducible for the same subjects under\\nthe same conditions, and that the regular or irreg-\\nular nature of the breathing pattern is thus part of\\nthepersonnalite´ respiratoire .\\nSeveral further studies have been carried out on\\nthis subject revealing the persistence of this res-\\npiratory personality under diverse conditions. In\\nthese studies, the airﬂow shape was quantiﬁed by\\na harmonic analysis providing eight variables,\\nwhich contained more than 95% of the power of\\nthe original signal. However, these eight variables\\nhave no physiological ‘meaning’ or ‘correspon-\\ndence’, they merely quantify a shape. The ventila-\\ntory variables and the airﬂow shape were then\\ncompared using a test of similarity. For example,\\nto assess the individuality of breathing pattern\\nover time, a multivariate statistical test was used\\nto compare differences between the ﬁrst and sec-\\nond recording within individuals with those differ-\\nences observed between random pairs of\\nrecordings from the two studies on the same\\ngroup of individuals. Thus, the test provides a\\nresult on the group and not of each individual.\\nSuch an analysis allows for differences within an\\nindividual, but implies that the individual has a\\ncertain ‘trait’ that can be recognized amongst\\nother individuals. This is analogous to the fact\\nthat one can recognize a person’s face in a crowd,\\neven after a number of years, despite any changes\\nwhich may have occurred in their facial appear-\\nance. However, these tests are a comparison be-\\ntween individual variables and are designed to\\ndetect any kind of deviation from the hypothesis\\nbut not a speciﬁc alternative. This is similar to the\\nx2 goodness-of-ﬁt test in which no alternative\\nhypothesis is speciﬁed. On the other hand, be-\\ncause of the natural large variability of the de-\\nscriptive variables associated with each individual\\nand the lack of models as to their variation, it is\\ndifﬁcult to perform comparisons within individual\\nwithout reference to the between-individual vari-\\nability. In the proposed similarity tests, this be-\\ntween individual variability is used precisely as the\\nbasis for assessing whether the variability within\\nan individual of the descriptive variables is mean-\\ningful or not.\\nThis test was applied to show similarity in the\\nﬂow proﬁle within an individual (i) on repeated\\nrecordings, (ii) on recordings performed 4 years\\napart and (iii) on recordings in seated and supine\\nconditions. In addition, it was found that identical\\ntwins breathe in a more similar way than any\\nother pair of individuals from the same popula-\\ntion. Considering conditions other than control, it\\nwas found that the airﬂow shapes are maintained\\nduring hypoxia (simulated altitude of 4500 m),\\nbut they are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed during exercise\\n(at 50% of their maximal oxygen consumption).\\nComparison of airﬂow shapes at this level of\\nexercise between normoxia and hypoxia (simu-\\nlated altitude of 4500 m), showed resemblance\\nwhich suggests that when exercising, subjects\\nadopt another individuality unchanged by hy-\\npoxia. A summary of these studies is given by\\nBenchetrit and Guz (1993) and the topic has been\\noverviewed by Shea and Guz (1992).\\nIt was also shown that during resistive loading\\nsome individual characteristics (ﬂow proﬁle and\\nTI:TTOT were maintained despite being propor-\\ntional to the loads changes in the other ventila-\\ntory variables (Calabrese et al., 1998).\\nThese observations suggest that a resting indi-\\nvidual pattern, at least in the airﬂow proﬁle, is\\nmaintained over a certain extent of changes in the\\nminute ventilation, thereafter, there are also\\nchanges in the airﬂow proﬁle. It has been hypoth-\\nesized, that the characteristics of the changes\\nwould be common to all subjects and a model was\\nproposed where there will be a sudden change in'),\n",

Consequences of the diversity and individuality\\nof the breathing pattern\\n4.1. How are control subjects to be chosen ?\\nIn most studies on ventilatory changes, control\\nexperiments are carried out on subjects matched\\nby age, weight and sex. Given the diversity of the\\nbreathing pattern the question arises as to\\nwhether this age and morphology matching yields\\nadequate control subjects.\\nIt has not been clearly established whether in\\nadult human subjects, there is a relationship be-\\ntween these characteristics and the components of\\nthe breathing pattern. Jammes et al. (1979) re-\\nported a study on 235 subjects of both sexes aged\\nbetween 6 and 80. They found no signiﬁcant\\nsex-related differences in any group when VT,f R,\\nTI and T E were compared. Whereas the changes\\nwith age in the range 6–25 were clearly obvious,\\nvariations according to age in adults were less\\nconclusive. They also compared the coefﬁcient of\\nvariation of these variables and found that they\\nwere independent of age. Tobin et al. (1983)\\nfound that the mean values of ventilatory vari-\\nables were not affected by age but the rhythmicity\\nwas more irregular in the elderly. Hudgel et al.\\n(1993) reported a greater variability of breathing\\ncharacteristics in the elderly compared with that\\nin younger subjects during sleep but not during\\nwakefulness. Whereas Hak et al. (1999) observed\\nthat in elderly subjects without sleep disordered\\nbreathing the change in the coefﬁcient of variation\\nof ventilatory variables between wakefulness and\\nsleep was similar to that reported in the younger\\ngroup of Hudgel et al. (1993). It is possible that\\nsome, if not all, of the discrepancies between these\\nresults may be explained by the diversity of\\nbreathing pattern within the group of subjects.\\nDejours et al. (1961) reported that the diversity\\nof V T and f R, of the subjects was related neither\\nto their height, their vital capacity (VC), maximal\\ninspiratory and expiratory volumes, forced expira-\\ntory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) nor to their FEV1 :\\nVC ratio. They also found that there was no\\ncorrelation between fR and the respiratory resis-\\ntance or compliance or resistance x compliance\\nproduct.\\nAs to the ﬂow proﬁles, in a tentative classiﬁca-\\ntion (Benchetrit et al., 1987) it was found that no\\nnoteworthy features attributable to differences in\\nsize, weight, body surface area, sex or smoking\\nhabits were observed in the clusters of ﬂow\\nproﬁles.\\nThe selection of control subjects remains a mat-\\nter to be resolved. Whoever these control subjects\\nare, one reasonable comparison to be considered\\nwould be that of the perturbation response\\nparameters (slope, delay etc). Indeed, changes be-\\ntween the resting pattern and the perturbed pat-\\ntern are likely to be similar in different individuals\\nand to lead to elaborate a control response func-\\ntion with which an ‘abnormal’ response function\\nmay be compared.\\n4.2. How important are these differences in\\nresting pattern ?\\nIn addition to the question of the choice of\\ncontrol subjects, at least two situations may be\\nevoked where the differences in pattern of breath-\\ning are pertinent.\\n1. In a recent study Salerno et al. (1999) have\\nshown that methacholine induced bronchocon-\\nstriction was modulated by the amplitude of\\nthe tidal ventilation. In these experiments car-\\nried out on open chest dogs the two lungs were\\nventilated separately with different VT and\\nlungs ventilated with higher amplitudes always\\ndemonstrated lesser increases in resistance and\\nelastance during induced constriction. When\\nmean bronchial pressure was kept constant,\\nthe discrepancy in the contractile response be-\\ntween the two lungs was again evident. This\\ndemonstrates that large VT inhibits airway\\nsmooth muscle contraction, regardless of mean\\nbronchial pressure. Although these observa-\\ntions were obtained during induced bron-\\nchoconstriction, it may be suggested that\\nairway contractility may also change with VT\\nin normal lung. Thus, there may be ventilatory'),\n",

Benchetrit : Respiration Physiology 122 (2000) 123–129128\\n(in the broadest sense) differences between\\nsubjects with high and low V T, ‘high’ and ‘low’\\nneeding to be deﬁned. Intuitively, one would\\ndeﬁne high and low VT according to the\\nstature of the subject. One possible estimation\\nwould be the use of the ratio of VT to the vital\\ncapacity. For example, an individual using one\\ntenth of his vital capacity in tidal breathing\\nmay be deﬁned as having a low VT whereas an\\nindividual using one ﬁfth of his VC would\\nhave a high VT.\\n2. The breathing rate becomes important when\\nconsidering its interrelation with other\\nrhythms. For example, for a heart rate of 60\\nbeats per minute in the range of normal\\nbreathing rate between 6 and 30 breaths per\\nminute, there will be ten heart beats per breath\\nfor the slowest breathing rate and two for the\\nfastest. Apart from the role of the breathing\\nrate in respiratory sinus arrhythmia which is\\nwell documented, this heart rate:breathing rate\\nratio may result in more than anecdotal out-\\ncomes; mechanical effect of intrathoracic pres-\\nsure changes, the time necessary to transport\\nthe information from the lungs to chemorecep-\\ntors, delay and gain in the reﬂex loops, etc.\\nThere are other rhythms also which are known\\nto inﬂuence the breathing rhythm, walking, pedal-\\ning or mechanical ventilation may entrain the\\nbreathing rate. Does the resting breathing rate\\ndetermine the parameters (ratio, range,\\nboundaries) of entrainment?\\nTo summarize, the existence of the diversity\\nand individuality in breathing pattern suggests\\nthat there are degrees of freedom in the resting\\npattern, and as pointed out by Dejours et al.\\n(1961), an inﬁnite number of possible combina-\\ntions of the ventilatory components and airﬂow\\nshape exists capable of achieving the same minute\\nventilation. The number of combinations de-\\ncreases when the demand for ventilation increases\\nand at maximal ventilatory values all individuals\\ntend to exhibit more similar patterns, such as a\\nrectangular air ﬂow proﬁle or equal inspiratory\\nand expiratory times.\\nThe diversity and individuality of the resting\\nbreathing pattern is worth being taken into ac-\\ncount when studying changes in ventilation and\\nthe individual results are as meaningful as the\\ngroup results. However, until we ﬁnd out why\\nindividuals do breathe in different ways, the\\nmethod we adopt to take into account these rest-\\ning patterns will proceed by trial and error and\\nthus remain empirical.\\nReferences\\nBachy, J.P., Eberhard, A., Baconnier, P., Benchetrit, G., 1986.\\nA program for cycle-by-cycle shape analysis of biological\\nrhythms.

Chest Pain Means More Than Pain in the \\nChest. Pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in \\nthe chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdo-\\nmen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and \\nfatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents.\\n2. High-Sensitivity Troponins Preferred. High-\\nsensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred \\nstandard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of \\nacute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accu-\\nrate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury.\\n3. Early Care for Acute Symptoms. Patients \\nwith acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent \\nsymptoms should seek medical care immediately \\nby calling 9-1-1. Although most patients will not \\nhave a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients \\nshould focus on the early identification or exclusion \\nof life-threatening causes.\\n4. Share the Decision-Making. Clinically stable \\npatients presenting with chest pain should be \\nincluded in decision-making; information about risk \\nof adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and \\nalternative options should be provided to facilitate \\nthe discussion.\\n5. Testing Not Needed Routinely for Low-Risk \\nPatients. For patients with acute or stable chest \\npain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic \\ntesting for suspected coronary artery disease is \\nnot needed.\\n6. Pathways. Clinical decision pathways for chest \\npain in the emergency department and outpatient \\nsettings should be used routinely.\\n7. Accompanying Symptoms. Chest pain is the \\ndominant and most frequent symptom for both \\nmen and women ultimately diagnosed with acute \\ncoronary syndrome. Women may be more likely \\nto present with accompanying symptoms such as \\nnausea and shortness of breath.\\n8. Identify Patients Most Likely to Benefit \\nFrom Further Testing. Patients with acute or \\nstable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or \\nintermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive \\ncoronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit \\nthe most from cardiac imaging and testing.\\n9. Noncardiac Is In. Atypical Is Out. “Noncardiac” \\nshould be used if heart disease is not suspected. \\n“Atypical” is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, \\nand its use is discouraged.\\n10. Structured Risk Assessment Should Be \\nUsed. For patients presenting with acute or stable \\nchest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and \\nadverse events should be estimated using evi-\\ndence-based diagnostic protocols.\\nFigure 1 illustrates the take-home messages.\\nPREAMBLE\\nSince 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) \\nand American Heart Association (AHA) have translated \\nscientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with \\nrecommendations to improve cardiovascular health. \\nThese guidelines, which are based on systematic meth-\\nods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a founda-\\ntion for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The \\nACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication \\nof clinical practice guidelines without commercial sup-\\nport, and members volunteer their time to the writing and \\nreview efforts. Guidelines are official policy of the ACC \\nand AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA part-\\nner with other organizations.\\nIntended Use\\nClinical practice guidelines provide recommendations \\napplicable to patients with or at risk of developing \\ncardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice \\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on July 14, 2024\\n'),\n",

Although guidelines may \\nbe used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the in-\\ntent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ \\ninterests. Guidelines are intended to define practices \\nmeeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, cir-\\ncumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.\\nClinical Implementation\\nManagement, in accordance with guideline recom-\\nmendations, is effective only when followed by both \\npractitioners and patients. Adherence to recommen-\\ndations can be enhanced by shared decision-making \\nbetween clinicians and patients, with patient engage-\\nment in selecting interventions on the basis of indi-\\nvidual values, preferences, and associated conditions \\nand comorbidities.\\nMethodology and Modernization\\nThe ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice \\nGuidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, up-\\ndates, and modifies guideline methodology on the basis \\nof published standards from organizations, including the \\nInstitute of Medicine, 1,2 and on the basis of internal re-\\nevaluation. Similarly, presentation and delivery of guide-\\nlines are reevaluated and modified in response to evolv-\\ning technologies and other factors to optimally facilitate \\ndissemination of information to healthcare professionals \\nat the point of care.\\nNumerous modifications to the guidelines have been \\nimplemented to make them shorter and enhance “user \\nfriendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a \\nmodular, “knowledge chunk” format, in which each chunk \\nincludes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, \\nrecommendation-specific supportive text and, when \\nFigure 1.

Hyper-\\nlinked references are provided for each modular knowl-\\nedge chunk to facilitate quick access and review.\\nIn recognition of the importance of cost–value con-\\nsiderations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and \\nfeasible, an analysis of value for a drug, device, or inter-\\nvention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/\\nAHA methodology.3\\nTo ensure that guideline recommendations remain \\ncurrent, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis \\nby the writing committee and staff. Going forward, tar-\\ngeted sections/knowledge chunks will be revised \\ndynamically after publication and timely peer review of \\npotentially practice-changing science. The previous des-\\nignations of “full revision” and “focused update” will be \\nphased out. For additional information and policies on \\nguideline development, readers may consult the ACC/\\nAHA guideline methodology manual4 and other method-\\nology articles. 5-7 The Class of Recommendation (COR) \\nindicates the strength of recommendation, encompass-\\ning the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in \\nproportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the \\nquality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention \\non the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data \\nfrom clinical trials and other sources (Table 1).4\\nSelection of Writing Committee Members\\nThe Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guide-\\nline writing committee contains requisite content exper-\\ntise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular \\ncommunity by selection of experts across a spectrum of \\nbackgrounds, representing different geographic regions, \\nsexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, \\nand clinical practice settings. Organizations and profes-\\nsional societies with related interests and expertise are \\ninvited to participate as partners or collaborators.\\nRelationships With Industry and Other Entities\\nThe ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods \\nto ensure that documents are developed without bias or \\nimproper influence. The complete policy on relationships \\nwith industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online. \\nAppendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee mem-\\nbers’ relevant RWI; for the purposes of full transparency, \\ntheir comprehensive disclosure information is available in \\nthe Supplemental Appendix. Comprehensive disclosure in-\\nformation for the Joint Committee is also available online.\\nEvidence Review and Evidence Review \\nCommittees\\nIn developing recommendations, the writing committee \\nuses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all \\navailable data.4,5 Literature searches focus on randomized \\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonran-\\ndomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, \\ncohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinions. \\nOnly key references are cited.\\nAn independent evidence review committee is com-\\nmissioned when there are ≥ 1 questions deemed of \\nutmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic \\nreview to determine which patients are most likely to ben-\\nefit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what \\ndegree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence review \\ncommittee and formal systematic review include absence \\nof a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of \\ndefining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent \\nwith the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial \\nnumber of patients, and likelihood that the findings can \\nbe translated into actionable recommendations. Evidence \\nreview committee members may include methodologists, \\nepidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians. Recom-\\nmendations developed by the writing committee on the \\nbasis of the systematic review are marked “SR.”\\nGuideline-Directed Management and Therapy\\nThe term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) \\nencompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and \\nboth pharmacological and procedural treatments. For \\nthese and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the \\nreader should confirm dosage with product insert material \\nand evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Rec-\\nommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treat-\\nments approved for clinical use in the United States.\\nPatrick T.

Defining Chest Pain\\nRecommendations for Defining Chest Pain\\nReferenced studies that support the recommendations are \\nsummarized in Online Data Supplements 1 and 2.\\nCOR LOE Recommendations\\n1 B-NR\\n1. An initial assessment of chest pain is \\nrecommended to triage patients effectively on \\nthe basis of the likelihood that symptoms may \\nbe attributable to myocardial ischemia.1-7\\n1 C-LD\\n2. Chest pain should not be described as atypical, \\nbecause it is not helpful in determining the \\ncause and can be misinterpreted as benign in \\nnature. Instead, chest pain should be described \\nas cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac \\nbecause these terms are more specific to the \\npotential underlying diagnosis.\\nSynopsis\\nChest pain is one of the most common reasons that \\npeople seek medical care. The term “chest pain” is \\nused by patients and applied by clinicians to describe \\nthe many unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations in \\nthe anterior chest that prompt concern for a cardiac \\nproblem. Chest pain should be considered acute when \\nit is new onset or involves a change in pattern, inten-\\nsity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a \\npatient with recurrent symptoms. Chest pain should be \\nconsidered stable when symptoms are chronic and as-\\nsociated with consistent precipitants such as exertion \\nor emotional stress.\\nAlthough the term chest pain is used in clinical prac-\\ntice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, \\nheaviness, or burning. In this regard, a more appropriate \\nterm is “chest discomfort,” because patients may not use \\nthe descriptor “pain.” They may also report a location other \\nthan the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, \\nupper abdomen, or jaw. Despite individual variability, the \\ndiscomfort induced by myocardial ischemia is often char-\\nacteristic and therefore central to the diagnosis. For this \\nreason, features more likely to be associated with isch-\\nemia have been described as typical versus atypical; how-\\never, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently \\nused to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as \\nwell as noncardiac. Although other nonclassic symptoms \\nof ischemia, such as shortness of breath, nausea, radiat-\\ning discomfort, or numbness, may be present, chest pain \\nor chest discomfort remains the predominant symptom \\nreported in men and women who are ultimately diagnosed \\nwith myocardial ischemia. 3-7 Pain—described as sharp, \\nfleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or \\nshifting locations—suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.\\nFigure 2.

Like most visceral discomfort, the sensation pro-\\nduced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically \\ndeep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse. Point \\ntenderness renders ischemia less likely. Reported \\nsymptoms lie somewhere on a continuum of higher \\nor lower probability of ischemia based on the pres-\\nence or absence of specific characteristics (Figure \\n2). Other clinical elements (eg, duration, provok-\\ning and relieving factors, patient age, cardiac risk \\nfactors) provide further focus toward or away from \\nischemia in the diagnostic process. It is essential \\nto ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain \\ndirectly from the patient for optimal interpreta-\\ntion.1-7 A patient’s history is the most important \\nbasis for considering presence or absence of myo-\\ncardial ischemia, but the source of cardiac symp-\\ntoms is complex, and their expression is variable. \\nThe diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond \\nhistory alone. In some patients, what appears to be \\nnoncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin.\\n2. Chest pain has been traditionally stratified into \\n“typical” and “atypical” types. Chest pain that is more \\nlikely associated with ischemia consists of subster-\\nnal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emo-\\ntional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. The \\nmore classic the chest discomfort is based on qual-\\nity, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving \\nfactors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic \\norigin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term. \\nAlthough it was intended to indicate angina with-\\nout typical chest symptoms, it is more often used to \\nstate that the symptom is noncardiac in origin. As \\nsuch, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain. \\nEmphasis is more constructively placed on specific \\naspects of symptoms that suggest their origin in \\nterms of probable ischemia. Of note, chest pain is \\nbroadly defined to also include referred pain in the \\nshoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen. To \\ndiminish ambiguity, use “cardiac,” “possible cardiac,” \\nand “noncardiac” to describe the suspected cause \\nof chest pain is encouraged.\\n1.5.

Although there are several \\nlife-threatening causes, chest pain usually reflects a more \\nbenign condition (Figure 3).2-4 The initial ECG is important \\nto the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and \\nother aids remain essential. There is frequently a lack of \\ncorrelation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness \\nof disease and general similarity of symptoms among differ-\\nent causes of chest pain. A comprehensive history that cap-\\ntures all the characteristics of chest pain (Table 3), including \\nbut not limited to its: 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) \\nlocation and radiation; 4) precipitating factors; 5) relieving \\nfactors; and 6) associated symptoms can help better iden-\\ntify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from \\nall patients.\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. Angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest \\ndiscomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over \\nseveral minutes), is usually precipitated by stress \\n(physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in \\nthe case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation \\n(eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symp-\\ntoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). \\nWhen actively treated or spontaneously resolving, \\nit dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitro-\\nglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial \\nischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic \\ncriterion, especially because other entities dem-\\nonstrate comparable response (eg, esophageal \\nspasm).1,5 Associated symptoms such as short-\\nness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheaded-\\nness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague \\nabdominal symptoms are more frequent among \\npatients with diabetes, women, and the elderly.

Women also had more cardiovascular risk \\nfactors, including hypertension (66.6% versus \\n63.2%; P<0.001), hyperlipidemia (68.9% ver-\\nsus 66.3%; P=0.004), older age (62.4±7 .9 years \\nof age versus 59.0±8.4 years of age, P <0.001), \\ncerebral or peripheral artery disease (6.2% ver-\\nsus 4.7%; P <0.001), family history of premature \\nCAD (34.6% versus 29.3%; P <0.001), and sed-\\nentary lifestyle (53.5% versus 43.4%; P <0.001). \\nPhysician assessments often misclassify chest \\npain as nonanginal.

As a result, a more extensive diagnostic \\nworkup is required in older patients.

To ensure the timely delivery of appropriate care, \\nespecially reperfusion therapy, it is strongly rec-\\nommended that patients with acute chest pain be \\ntransported to the ED by trained EMS personnel.2,3 \\nEMS transportation is associated with substantial \\nreductions in ischemic time and treatment delays. \\nMoreover, 1 in 300 patients with chest pain trans-\\nported to the ED by private vehicle suffers a car-\\ndiac arrest en route. 3 Understanding the mode of \\ntransportation to the ED for patients with chest \\npain and educating those who arrive by private \\nvehicle on the associated dangers is an important \\naspect of management.\\n2.2. Physical Examination\\nRecommendation for Physical Examination\\nCOR LOE Recommendation\\n1 C-EO\\n1. In patients presenting with chest pain, a \\nfocused cardiovascular examination should \\nbe performed initially to aid in the diagnosis \\nof ACS or other potentially serious causes \\nof chest pain (eg, aortic dissection, PE, \\nor esophageal rupture) and to identify \\ncomplications.\\nSynopsis\\nLife-threatening causes of chest pain include, but are not \\nlimited to, ACS, PE, aortic dissection, and esophageal rup-\\nture. Because ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarc-\\ntion (STEMI) can be recognized on the ECG, the major \\nchallenge is to distinguish between non–ST-segment–\\nelevation (NSTE)-ACS and noncardiac chest pain. 1 With \\nan uncomplicated AMI, the examination may be negative. \\nSudden onset of severe chest pain or back pain associ-\\nated with limb pulse differential suggest aortic dissection,2 \\nbut sensitivity of the latter finding alone was only 30%.3 PE \\nmay result in tachycardia, dyspnea, and accentuated P2. \\nNoncoronary causes of chest pain include aortic steno-\\nsis, aortic regurgitation, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, \\nwhich produces characteristic murmurs and pulse altera-\\ntions. Chest pain of pericarditis increases in the supine \\nposition and may be associated with a friction rub. Stress \\ncardiomyopathy presents in a similar manner as ACS. \\nChest pain accompanied by a painful, tympanic abdomen \\nmay indicate a potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal \\netiology such as esophageal rupture. 4 Pneumonia may \\ncause localized pleuritic chest pain accompanied by a fric-\\ntion rub. Pneumothorax may be accompanied by pleuritic \\nchest pain and unilateral absence of breath sounds. Ten-\\nderness to palpation of the costochondral joints may indi-\\ncate a musculoskeletal cause.

Transfer by EMS from the office setting for acute \\nchest pain with suspected ACS or other life-threat-\\ning conditions is recommended because of the \\nimportant advantages provided by EMS includ-\\ning: 1) acquisition of a prehospital ECG, which can \\nfacilitate reperfusion if ST elevation is present; 2) \\npresence of trained personnel who can provide \\ntreatment for chest pain, arrhythmias, and imple-\\nment defibrillation en route; and 3) shorter travel \\ntime to the ED.1-7 ,10\\n3.

Left ventricular hypertro-\\nphy, bundle branch blocks, and ventricular pac-\\ning may mask signs of ischemia or injury. 11 Up to \\n6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged \\nfrom the ED with a normal ECG. 12-17 In patients \\nwhere the initial ECG is normal or is without ST \\nelevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch \\nblock, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be \\nperformed and management should be guided by \\nnew electrocardiographic changes or other diag-\\nnostic testing (see Section 2.3.4 on Biomarkers, \\nSection 3.1 on Anatomic Testing, or Section 3.2 \\non Stress Testing).7 ,18-20 The timing for repeat ECG \\nshould also be guided by symptoms, especially if \\nchest pain recurs or a change in clinical condition \\ndevelops.21\\n2.

Their most important application in clinical \\npractice is for the rapid identification or exclusion of \\nmyocardial injury. The preferred biomarker to detect \\nor exclude myocardial injury is cTn (I or T) because \\nof its high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial \\ntissue. 1-21,33  hs-cTn is preferred and can detect cir-\\nculating cTn in the blood of most “healthy” individu-\\nals, with different sex-specific thresholds. 17 ,21,34 cTn \\nis organ-specific but not disease-specific. Numer-\\nous ischemic, noncoronary cardiac, and noncardiac \\ncauses of cardiomyocyte injury can result in elevated \\ncTn concentrations. 17 ,21,24,25 Therefore, interpretation \\nof cTn results requires integration with all clinical in-\\nformation. 17 ,21\\nAlthough multiple other cardiovascular biomarkers, \\nincluding some in common clinical use such as natri-\\nuretic peptides, have been shown to be associated with \\nthe risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients \\nwith chest pain, none have sufficient diagnostic accu-\\nracy for myocardial injury to be recommended for that \\npurpose. The use of D-dimer for diagnosis of PE is dis-\\ncussed in Section 4.2.2.\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. The preferred biomarker to detect or exclude \\ncardiac injury is cTn (I or T) because of its high \\nsensitivity and specificity for myocardial tissue. 1-21 \\nDetection of myocardial cell injury, possibly indica-\\ntive of AMI, is predicated on a rise or fall of this \\nbiomarker in blood. 1,3,4,10-21 A cTn concentration \\n>99th percentile upper reference limit, which is \\nassay-dependent, is an indicator of myocardial \\ninjury.1,9,21 The coefficient of variation at the 99th \\npercentile upper reference limit for each assay \\nshould be ≤10%.8,21\\n2. There is ample evidence for the superiority of hs-\\ncTn assays over conventional cTn assays in mul-\\ntiple aspects of evaluation for patients presenting \\nwith chest pain with and without AMI. 17 ,21,24,25,33 \\nThe sensitivity and negative predictive values are \\ngreater with hs-cTn compared with previous gen-\\neration assays.17 ,21,24,25 In addition, the time interval \\nfrom onset of chest pain to a detectable con-\\ncentration at patient presentation is shorter with \\nhs-cTn, affording more rapid rule-in and rule-out \\nalgorithms.22 Although it is sometimes challenging \\nto diagnostically discriminate among these causes \\nof myocardial injury, irrespective of the final diag-\\nnosis, the presence of myocardial injury is associ-\\nated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes among \\npatients with chest pain.35\\n3. The level of detection, 99th percentile upper ref-\\nerence limit, analytical precision, and criteria for \\na significant delta are assay-specific, including \\namong the many different manufacturers of the \\nsame analyte (eg, hs-cTnI). To appropriately apply \\na cTn assay, clinicians must be familiar with these \\nanalytical performance properties for the assay(s) \\nthat they use in their practice.21\\n4. Comparative studies have confirmed the superior-\\nity of cTn over CK-MB and myoglobin for diagnosis \\nand prognosis of AMI. 27-32 The addition of CK-MB \\nor myoglobin to cTn for evaluation of patients pre-\\nsenting with chest pain is not beneficial.\\n3. CARDIAC TESTING GENERAL \\nCONSIDERATIONS\\nFor acute and stable chest pain, noninvasive and invasive \\ndiagnostic testing is a core component of the evalua-\\ntion underpinning its importance. Over the past decade, \\nthe quality of evidence supporting clinical indications \\nfor noninvasive testing has grown dramatically. The ap-\\nproach outlined in this guideline focuses on selective use \\nof testing, optimization of lower cost evaluations, reduc-\\ning layered testing, and deferring or eliminating testing \\nwhen the diagnostic yield is low (Figure 5). Reducing un-\\nnecessary testing can provide a means to exert cost sav-\\nings within the diagnostic evaluation of populations. 1 In \\nthe same manner, elimination of testing where evidence \\nis lacking and the reduction in testing among low-risk \\npatients for whom deferred testing is appropriate are \\nemphasized in this guideline.\\nTesting choice will be influenced by site expertise and \\navailability, but knowledge regarding which test may be \\npreferable is useful when selecting between different \\nmodalities. Cost should also be considered, when known \\nby the ordering clinician and there is equipoise between \\navailable modalities. 2 The exercise ECG is the lowest \\ncost procedure used in the diagnostic evaluation when \\ncompared with stress imaging or anatomic procedures, \\nwith the exception of coronary artery calcium (CAC) \\nscoring (Figure 6). For all imaging procedures, costs vary \\nby payer and site of services.\\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of \\nthe various noninvasive tests available for use in the \\nevaluation of symptomatic patients. Previously, the term \\nknown as CAD had been used to define those with \\na significant obstructive stenosis (ie, ≥ 50%). In this \\nguideline, we revise the term known CAD to include \\npatients with prior anatomic testing (invasive angiog-\\nraphy or coronary computed tomographic angiography \\n[CCTA]) with identified nonobstructive atheroscle-\\nrotic plaque and obstructive CAD.

Stress Nuclear (PET or SPECT) Myocardial \\nPerfusion Imaging\\nAfter ACS has been ruled out, rest/stress positron emis-\\nsion tomography (PET) or single-photon emission com-\\nputed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imag-\\ning (MPI) allows for detection of perfusion abnormalities, \\nmeasures of left ventricular function, and high-risk find-\\nings, such as transient ischemic dilation.1-8 For PET, calcu-\\nlation of myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR, the ratio \\nof peak hyperemia to resting myocardial blood flow) adds \\ndiagnostic and prognostic information over MPI data. 9-14 \\nRadiation exposure, as reported by an average effective \\ndose, is ∼3 mSv for rest/stress PET with Rb-82 and ∼10 \\nmSv for Tc-99m SPECT; dual-isotope SPECT using thal-\\nlium is not recommended. 15-17 SPECT/PET contraindi-\\ncations are and contraindications to type of stress test \\n(exercise versus pharmacologic) are reported in Table 5.\\n3.2.4. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging\\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging \\nhas the capability to accurately assess global and \\nregional left and right ventricular function, detect \\nand localize myocardial ischemia and infarction, and \\ndetermine myocardial viability. CMR can also detect \\nmyocardial edema and microvascular obstruction, \\nwhich can help differentiate acute versus chronic MI, \\nas well as other causes of acute chest pain, includ-\\ning myocarditis. CMR contraindications are reported \\nin Table 5.\\n3.3. Cardiac Testing Considerations for Women \\nWho Are Pregnant, Postpartum, or of Child-\\nBearing Age\\nThis guideline focuses on elective and urgent cardiac \\ntesting and, in both circumstances, imaging using ion-\\nizing radiation during pregnancy or postpartum while \\nbreast feeding should generally be avoided. When im-\\naging is necessary to guide management, the risks and \\nbenefits of invasive angiography, SPECT, PET, or CCTA \\nshould be discussed with the patient. In all cases for \\na test deemed clinically necessary, the lowest effec-\\ntive dose of ionizing radiation should be used, including \\nconsiderations for tests with no radiation exposure (eg, \\nechocardiography, CMR imaging). 1 Radiation risk to the \\nfetus is very small. Iodinated contrast enters the fetal cir-\\nculation through the placenta and should be used with \\ncaution in a pregnant woman. The use of gadolinium \\ncontrast with CMR should be discouraged and used \\nonly when necessary to guide clinical management and \\nis expected to improve fetal or maternal outcome. 2-5 If \\ncontrast is needed for a postpartum woman, breastfeed-\\ning may continue because <1% of iodinated contrast \\nis excreted into the breast milk and absorbed into the \\ninfant’s gastrointestinal tract. 6\\n4. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATHWAY WITH \\nPATIENT-CENTRIC ALGORITHMS FOR \\nACUTE CHEST PAIN\\nAfter initial evaluation, the next step is determining \\nwhether further diagnostic testing is needed to estab-\\nlish a diagnosis or formulate a disposition plan. In some \\ncases, there is clearly minimal risk of a serious medical \\ncondition although, in others, uncertainty may remain. We \\nprovide guidance to help clinicians make this determina-\\ntion within the context of acute and stable chest pain \\npresentations.\\nThe initial assessment of patients presenting with \\nacute chest pain is focused on the rapid identification \\nof patients with immediately life-threatening conditions \\nsuch that appropriate medical interventions can be \\ninitiated. Included among the potentially life-threatening \\n(emergency) causes of chest pain are ACS (Section \\n4.1), acute aortic syndromes (Section 4.2.1), and PE \\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on July 14, 2024\\n'),\n",

There are important differences in the performance \\nof highly sensitive and conventional cTn assays. hs-\\ncTn assays may be used to guide disposition by \\nrepeat sampling at 1, 2, or 3 hours from ED arrival \\nusing the pattern of rise or fall (ie, delta) and the \\nrepeat value itself, based on assay-specific diag-\\nnostic thresholds.37-43 When using conventional cTn \\nassays, the sampling timeframe is extended to 3 to \\n6 hours from ED arrival.36\\n3. CDPs that include risk scores all perform well overall, \\nwith 99% to 100% sensitivity for index-visit AMI and \\n30-day MACE and have been shown to decrease \\nadvanced testing to varying degrees and should \\nbe used particularly with conventional cTn. 2,13,30-35 \\nHowever, because sex-specific considerations are \\nnot included in all scoring systems, their effective-\\nness in men and women may not be equal.51\\n4. Previous test results should always be consid-\\nered in the evaluation of patients with acute chest \\npain once ACS has been ruled out. In those with \\nrecent cardiac testing and normal findings who do \\nnot have biomarker evidence of acute myocardial \\ninjury, further testing is of limited value, provided that \\nadequate exercise levels were achieved or pharma-\\ncologic stress was performed, imaging was of suf-\\nficient quality, and there are no changes in symptom \\nfrequency or stability at the new visit. The “warranty” \\nintervals (Table 7) for the various cardiac testing \\nmodalities differ because of the low number of inci-\\ndent events among patients with a normal CCTA, \\nalthough patients with normal stress testing may still \\nhave significant plaque and a higher event rate.20-22 \\nThe warranty period for a normal stress-rest SPECT \\nis highly variable because it is primarily determined \\nby the type of stress, the patient’s clinical character-\\nistics, and left ventricular ejection fraction.52\\n5.

There are several methods to deter-\\nmine that a patient is low risk (Table 8) but, invariably, all in-\\nvolve taking an appropriate history and physical examina-\\ntion, demonstration that the ECG is normal, nonischemic, \\nor unchanged from the previous ECG, and cTn measure-\\nment at a single point in time (if presentation is >3 hours \\nfrom symptom onset and using a high-sensitivity assay) \\nor serially1-11 (with incorporation of a chest pain risk score \\ninto the CDP if using a conventional cTn assay). Impor-\\ntantly, there is no evidence to support routine admission \\nor cardiac testing for chest pain patients who are low risk, \\nalthough outpatient CAC scanning can provide additional \\ninformation for longer-term risk stratification.\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. A large proportion of patients presenting to the ED \\nwith chest pain are low risk based on a combination \\nof features, including clinical stability, medical history, \\nnonischemic ECG, and absence of acute myocardial \\ninjury on cTn measurement. Such individuals have \\na <1% frequency of ACS or MACE at 30 days. 1-11 \\nAlthough achieving this with conventional cTn assays \\nrequires incorporation of risk scores into a CPD, hs-\\ncTn results can be used on their own. This approach \\nhas been validated based on 15 studies including a \\ntotal of >9 600 patients, with a demonstrated nega-\\ntive predictive value for MI or death at 30 days of \\n99.8%.11 These findings reflect studies involving \\nboth hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT using serial measurement \\nalgorithms or a single hs-cTn, provided the final mea-\\nsurement is performed ≥3 hours after the onset of \\nsymptoms, without incorporation of risk scores.\\n2. For this low-risk subset of ED patients who have \\nchest pain, there is no evidence that stress testing \\nor cardiac imaging within 30 days of the index ED \\nvisit improves their outcomes. 18 This represents a \\nchange from previous guidelines where stress \\ntesting within 72 hours was broadly recommended \\nfor patients with acute chest pain.19 However, many \\nof these patients have baseline cardiac risk fac-\\ntors that need to be managed. Pathways to facili-\\ntate outpatient follow-up for further evaluation \\nand guideline-directed management of cardiac \\nrisk factors should be considered. Among patients \\npresenting to the ED with chest pain, there is a \\nseparate group that is at such low risk of having \\natherosclerotic plaque or 30-day MACE that they \\ndo not even need CDP-based risk stratification.\\n4.1.1.1. Cost-Value Considerations in the Evaluation \\nof Low-Risk Patients\\nThe costs associated with the acute evaluation of chest \\npain have been examined within systematic reviews, health \\ntechnology appraisals, and data collected in the obser-\\nvational or randomized clinical trial setting. 1-10 The deci-\\nsion analytic models suggest that the use of hs-Tn can \\nbe cost effective as a rule-out for ACS, primarily attribut-\\nable to prompt discharge of patients without hs-Tn eleva-\\ntions.2,8,11,12 Moreover, hs-Tn–guided diagnostic strategies \\nalso reduced the use of stress testing by nearly one-third.13 \\nFrom a large multicenter registry, the reduced time to dis-\\ncharge and use of noninvasive testing contributed to a cost \\nsavings of 20%.13 Nonadherence to management recom-\\nmendations impact the potential for cost savings.5 From a \\nrandomized trial applying the HEART Pathway, a modest \\n30-day cost savings of $216 per patient (P=0.04) was \\nobserved.6 However, the overall reductions in hospital ad-\\nmission and length of stay impacted population estimates \\nfor cost savings from 1 ED registry of 30 769 patients \\npresenting before and 23 699 patients presenting after \\nimplementation of an accelerated diagnostic pathway and \\nresulted in a total cost reduction of $13.5 million (Austra-\\nlian).7 Thus, improved process efficiency and discharge of \\nlow-risk patients largely results in overall cost reductions.\\n4.1.2.

Longer-term follow-up data from the \\nPROSPECT trial10 supported that at ∼3.5 years, the \\nrate of MACE was similar between MPI and CCTA \\n(P=0.29).10 Compared with CCTA, use of stress \\nMPI delayed the time to diagnosis by >50%. 1,4 \\nFurthermore, recent observation from 213 patients \\nreferred for rest-stress MPI with mildly abnormal \\nhs-cTn values reported no adverse events related \\nto the tests and a modest 13.6% yield for isch-\\nemic studies.55 Single-center, small (n=105) ran-\\ndomized trial evidence suggests that stress CMR \\nis safe without a near-term (90-day) increase in \\nhospital readmission or additional testing.32-34 From \\na single-center registry (n=135), stress CMR was \\nassociated with a high sensitivity (100%) and \\nspecificity (93%) for the detection of obstructive \\nCAD or cardiovascular events at 1 year.35\\nSequential or Add-on Testing\\n5.

Post-\\nsternotomy pain syndrome is defined as discomfort af-\\nter thoracic surgery, persisting for at least 2 months, and \\nwithout apparent cause. 15 The incidence of post-ster-\\nnotomy pain syndrome has been found to be as low as \\n7% and as high as 66%,16-19 with a higher prevalence in \\nwomen compared with men within the first 3 months of \\nthoracic surgery (51.4% versus 31.3%; P<0.01) but, af-\\nter 3 months, postoperative sex difference in prevalence \\nwas not seen. 20 Graft failure within the first year post-\\nCABG using saphenous venous grafts is usually a result \\nof technical issues, intimal hyperplasia, or thrombosis. 5 \\nInternal mammary artery graft failure within the first-year \\npost-CABG is most commonly attributable to issues with \\nthe anastomotic site of the graft.\\nReasons for acute chest pain several years after \\nCABG include either graft stenosis or occlusion or pro-\\ngression of disease in a non-bypassed vessel. One year \\nafter CABG, ∼ 10% to 20% of saphenous vein grafts \\nfail, while by 10 years, only about half of saphenous \\nvein grafts are patent. 5 In contrast, the internal mam-\\nmary artery has patency rates of 90% to 95% 10 \\nto 15 years after CABG. 6 Compared with the use of \\nsaphenous vein grafts, the use of radial artery grafts \\nfor CABG also resulted in a higher rate of patency at 5 \\nyears of follow-up. 7 In addition, knowledge of the native \\ncoronary anatomy and type of revascularization (com-\\nplete or incomplete) is useful for interpretation of func-\\ntional testing.\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. Acute chest pain in patients with prior CABG \\nmay be caused by myocardial ischemia as a \\nresult of technical errors at the graft anastomotic \\nsite, thrombosis within the graft, graft intimal \\nhyperplasia, or vasospasm within arterial grafts. \\nProgressive atherosclerosis within bypass grafts \\nor the native coronary vessels may also result \\nin acute chest pain caused by myocardial isch-\\nemia. Noninvasive stress imaging testing is rea-\\nsonable in these patients as stress imaging will \\nidentify ischemic myocardial territories that will \\nfurther guide revascularization for patients who \\nare amenable to and are candidates for revas-\\ncularization. CCTA has a great degree of accu-\\nracy with a sensitivity and specificity of detecting \\ncomplete graft occlusions, 99% and 99%, \\nrespectively, when compared with the standard \\nof ICA.21 Furthermore, CCTA was ideal in assess-\\ning bypass grafts because of the large size of \\nthese vessels, decreased vessel calcification, and \\ndecreased motion of these vessels when com-\\npared with native coronary vessels. Evaluation of \\nbypass grafts has been shown to be successful \\nin 93% to 100% of patients. 21 In patients who \\nhave acute chest pain without features of ACS, \\nCCTA is especially useful for assessing graft \\npatency and is less robust for assessing native \\ncoronary vessel stenosis in this population. 1-7\\n2. There are clinical features and stress imaging \\ntest features in patients with prior CABG pre-\\nsenting with acute chest pain with no ACS that \\nmay indicate a high likelihood of severe ischemic \\nheart disease such as new resting left ventricu-\\nlar systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection \\nfraction <35%) not readily explained by non-\\ncoronary causes, stress electrocardiographic \\nfindings including 2 mm of ST-segment depres-\\nsion at low workload or persisting into recov-\\nery, exercise-induced ST-segment elevation, or \\nexercise-induced VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF), \\nsevere stress-induced left ventricular systolic \\ndysfunction, stress-induced perfusion abnormali-\\nties involving ≥10% of the myocardium, or stress-\\ninduced left ventricular dilation. In those with prior \\nCABG with high-risk stress imaging features, \\nreferral for ICA is useful provided that these \\npatients are amenable to, and are candidates for, \\ncoronary revascularization. 8-14 Patients with prior \\nCABG presenting with acute chest pain without \\nthe presence of ACS may have stress imaging \\nfeatures that are equivocal or nondiagnostic for \\nthe presence of myocardial ischemia. Equivocal or \\nnondiagnostic stress imaging may be as a result \\nof patient’s body habitus, inadequate or subopti-\\nmal heart rate, arrhythmias such as atrial fibrilla-\\ntion, left bundle branch block, or patient motion.

In patients presenting with acute chest pain, \\nit is reasonable to consider cocaine and \\nmethamphetamine use as a cause of their \\nsymptoms.1-3\\nSynopsis\\nThe most frequent presenting complaint of cocaine \\nabuse is acute chest pain, resulting from ≥1 of the alka-\\nloid’s many cardiovascular actions.1,4,5 Cocaine produces \\na hyperadrenergic state by blocking neuronal reuptake \\nof norepinephrine and dopamine. The accumulation of \\nthese catecholamines increases heart rate and blood \\npressure, sometimes dramatically. These actions and \\nthe drug’s simultaneous effect of coronary vasocon-\\nstriction and elevated myocardial oxygen demand can \\nproduce myocardial ischemia and even infarction in \\nthe absence of obstructive CAD. Additional hazardous \\nactions include increased myocardial contractility, car-\\ndiac arrhythmias, myocardial toxicity directly or through \\naugmented adrenergic stimulation, increased platelet \\naggregability, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertensive \\nvascular catastrophes (aortic dissection, cerebrovascu-\\nlar hemorrhage). 4-6\\nMethamphetamine has also been shown to lead to \\nmyocardial ischemia from mechanisms similar to cocaine. \\nStudies have shown that methamphetamine can result in \\ndecreased myocardial perfusion. Like cocaine, metham-\\nphetamine also may reduce coronary sinus blood flow.7 It \\nhas been reported that up to 70% of methamphetamine \\nusers have an abnormal ECG, with the most common \\nfinding being tachycardia. 8 Additional abnormalities on \\nthe ECG have been attributed to presence of hyperten-\\nsion, pulmonary artery hypertension, and cardiomyopathy, \\nall of which have been associated with methamphet-\\namine use. 9 General principles for risk stratification of \\npatients with chest pain apply to patients with cocaine or \\nmethamphetamine use.4\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. Cocaine and methamphetamine use can be con-\\nsidered in young patients presenting with chest \\npain and evidence of ACS; the frequency of ACS \\nis <10% among cocaine and methamphetamine \\nusers in most studies, and death is rare. 1-4 A per-\\nson’s urine typically tests positive for cocaine or \\nmethamphetamine within 1 to 4 hours of consum-\\ning the drug and will continue to test positive for 2 \\nto 4 days.\\n4.1.7.

Adult ED patients with acute chest pain who are \\ndeemed low risk are frequently admitted for obser-\\nvation and cardiac stress testing or CCTA, resulting \\nin increased cost to the patient and the health care \\nsystem.2 Shared decision-making is the process \\nby which patients and clinicians share information \\nand take steps to build consensus about preferred \\ntests and treatments. In shared decision-making, \\nboth parties share information: the clinician offers \\noptions and describes the potential harms and \\nbenefits, and the patient communicates his or her \\npreferences. Patients are prepared with a better \\nunderstanding of the relevant factors influencing \\nthe decision and share responsibility for deciding \\nhow to proceed. Shared decision-making rests on \\nthe principles of patient centered care, including \\nrespect for patient autonomy (ie, that a patient’s \\ninformed preferences should be the basis for med-\\nical action). 4 Decision aids are patient-centered \\ntools designed to facilitate shared decision-mak-\\ning between a patient and the clinician such that \\npatients’ values and preferences are incorporated \\ninto health care decisions. 5 Shared decision-mak-\\ning, however, can be performed without a deci-\\nsion aid; lack of a decision aid should not preclude \\nattempts at shared decision-making.\\n2.

Cocaine use \\nmay provoke dissection even without other risk factors.\\nAcute onset of severe chest or back pain heralds acute \\naortic dissection in 80% to 90% of patients, sometimes \\ncharacterized as ripping or tearing.3 Progression can pro-\\nduce end-organ hypoperfusion, and proximal extension \\nmay cause tamponade, severe acute aortic regurgita-\\ntion, or rarely, STEMI. Intramural hematomas, which differ \\nfrom dissection by absence of an identifiable intimal flap, \\nhave a lesser understood natural history but are typically \\nevaluated and treated in a similar manner to dissections.\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. A high index of suspicion in appropriate patients, and \\na coordinated, multidisciplinary evaluation is needed \\nto optimize outcomes.

For patients with acute chest pain and possible \\nPE, need for further testing should be guided \\nby pretest probability.\\nSynopsis\\nThe incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100 000, \\nbut some cases are asymptomatic and others undiag-\\nnosed.5,6 One-third of deaths are sudden, and 60% are undi-\\nagnosed before death.7 Risk factors for PE are the same \\nfor venous thromboembolism and include inherited hyper-\\ncoagulable states and acquired risk factors (recent sur-\\ngery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, smoking, obesity, \\noral contraception). Recognition of PE can be challenging \\nbecause symptoms and clinical signs may be nonspecific. \\nDyspnea followed by chest pain, classically pleuritic, is the \\nmost common presenting symptom.1 Signs of deep venous \\nthrombosis may be present on examination.5\\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\\n1. CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality \\nof choice in stable patients; ventilation-perfusion \\nscanning is a second-line alternative in the acute \\nsetting.3,4 Use of clinical prediction rules to select \\npatients for imaging can decrease radiation expo-\\nsure and cost.8 Troponin (and brain natriuretic pep-\\ntide) can be elevated, and echocardiography may \\nreveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to \\nlarge PEs; troponin and brain natriuretic peptide \\nare both markers for higher mortality rate.2\\n2. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anti-\\ncoagulation improves outcomes. 2 Clinical assess-\\nment combined with pretest risk stratification can \\nhelp select patients appropriate for diagnostic imag-\\ning. In the absence of shock, diagnostic evaluation \\ndepends on the clinical assessment of pretest prob-\\nability.3 Several prediction rules are available that add \\npredictive value to clinical assessment.4 D-dimers are \\nhighly sensitive but not very specific for the diagno-\\nsis of PE in ED patients. Measurement of D-dimers, \\nusing age- and sex-specific cutoffs, may be useful \\nin patients at low to intermediate pretest probability; \\nthose with negative D-dimers can probably be dis-\\ncharged without further testing, whereas those with \\npositive values should be considered for CTA.2\\n4.2.3.

The duration can be minutes \\nto hours, often occurs after meals or at night, and can \\nworsen with stress. Depending on the severity, it may or \\nmay not resolve spontaneously or with antacids. Esoph-\\nagitis not related to reflux may be caused by medica-\\ntions, underlying infections such as candidiasis, or ra-\\ndiation injury.

Although the \\nclinical presentation often does not provide ade-\\nquate clues to distinguish cardiac from esopha-\\ngeal pain, some symptoms may be suggestive of \\nan esophageal cause, such as heartburn, regur-\\ngitation, or dysphagia, and relief with antacid or \\nantisecretory agents. These symptoms, however, \\nare not sufficiently specific to be fully diagnos-\\ntic. A history of use of medications such as non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, potassium \\nsupplements, iron, or bisphosphonates should \\nbe sought. Physical examination is often unre-\\nvealing. When an esophageal cause of chest \\npain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be \\nconsidered. 4 Symptoms and signs that merit \\nearly evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include \\ndysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleed-\\ning, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, weight \\nloss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without \\nthese symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid \\nsuppression therapy. 5 If an upper endoscopy is \\nnormal and the symptoms persist despite a trial \\nof acid suppression, consideration should be \\ngiven to additional evaluation, such as esoph-\\nageal function testing and pH monitoring, to \\nexclude other esophageal causes. 6\\n4.3.2.

Current \\nobservations in the United States include:\\n• T ypical exertional angina prevalence is gener-\\nally low (<10%), with more patients presenting \\nwithout the classic demand-related symptoms. 11 \\nSymptoms can be infrequent (ie, on a weekly or \\nmonthly basis),12,13 which challenges the diagnostic \\nevaluation.\\n• Among patients undergoing a diagnostic evalua-\\ntion, there is a relatively low prevalence of obstruc-\\ntive CAD and ischemia (ie, ∼10%).11,14,15\\n• Traditional pretest risk scores largely overes-\\ntimate disease probability and contribute to \\novertesting.16-19\\n• Current testing patterns result in a high normal \\ncoronary angiography rate (upward of 50%–\\n60%).20,21 For the aforementioned reasons, use \\nof a contemporary pretest probability estimates \\nto define low-risk patients not requiring additional \\ndiagnostic testing is a primary goal of the initial \\nevaluation of symptomatic patients with suspected \\nCAD.5 Even when contemporary pretest probability \\nestimates are used, they have a low specificity for \\nidentifying patients with obstructive CAD.

There are several pretest probability scores for \\nuse in symptomatic patients with suspected \\nCAD. Older pretest probability scores, such as \\nthe Diamond-Forrester model developed in 1979, \\nestimates the probability of obstructive CAD, \\nresulting in significant overestimation in contem-\\nporary patients referred for noninvasive imaging, \\nparticularly women. 1 Newer pretest probability \\nestimates are available. 4 The CAD Consortium \\nmodels include basic (age, sex, symptoms, and \\nhospital setting); clinical (basic model + risk fac-\\ntors: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \\nsmoking); and extended (clinical model + CAC) \\nversions. Each new variant is better than older \\nmodels, and the addition of variables within each \\nmodel level improves prediction.3 A major strength \\nof these models is the extensive validation in dif-\\nferent hospitals, settings, and countries. Another \\nupdated model to estimate the pretest probability \\nof obstructive CAD was recently developed4,22 and \\nhas been recommended by the ESC guidelines, \\nfurther reinforcing that the prevalence of obstruc-\\ntive CAD among symptomatic patients is substan-\\ntially lower than predicted estimates.\\n2. Among symptomatic patients, a CAC score of zero \\nidentifies a low-risk cohort of patients who may not \\nrequire additional diagnostic testing; most events \\noccur among patients with detectable CAC (eg, \\n84% in the PROMISE trial). 7, 9 Several randomized \\ntrials evaluated the role of CAC in guiding selective \\nuse of follow-up testing, including CCTA. 6,7 From \\nthe CRESCENT 1 (Comprehensive Cardiac CT \\nVersus Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary \\nArtery Disease) trial, 350 symptomatic patients \\nwere randomized to CAC scanning versus exer-\\ncise ECGs.7 Only patients with detectable CAC or \\nhigh pretest risk (141/242) underwent follow-up \\nCCTA. At 1 year, the CAC arm was associated with \\na reduction in cardiovascular disease events when \\ncompared with those who underwent exercise \\ntesting alone (P=0.011).\\n3. Exercise testing was shown to be an effective \\ndiagnostic strategy in low-risk symptomatic women \\nfrom the WOMEN (What Is the Optimal Method for \\nIschemia Evaluation in Women) trial, when com-\\npared with exercise MPI. 10 Using this approach, \\nthere was no significant difference in CAD death \\nor hospitalization for an ACS or heart failure, with \\neither test, but exercise testing alone provided sig-\\nnificant cost savings.\\n5.1.3.

Clinical trials report a higher diagnostic sensitivity \\nfor CCTA compared with stress testing for detect-\\ning obstructive CAD on ICA. 2-4,37 ,38,88 CCTA with-\\nout stenosis or plaque has a low CAD event rate. \\nFrom the PROMISE trial, the 3-year CAD event \\nrate for negative test findings was 0.9% for CCTA \\nversus 2.1% for stress testing. 17Randomized tri-\\nals comparing the effectiveness of CCTA versus \\nstress testing report similar near-term effective-\\nness (at ∼2–3 years of follow-up). 7 ,8,10-12,89 In the \\nSCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography \\nof the Heart) trial, the addition of CCTA to stan-\\ndard of care resulted in a reduction in 5-year CAD \\ndeath or AMI when compared with standard care \\nalone (predominantly exercise ECG) (HR: 0.59; \\n95% CI: 0.41-0.84; P=0.004). 9 From a prespeci-\\nfied analysis from the PROMISE trial, patients with \\ndiabetes who underwent CCTA had a lower risk of \\ncardiovascular death or MI when compared with \\nthose randomized to stress testing (adjusted HR: \\n0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.79; P=0.01).6 Especially for \\npatients with nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, \\nCCTA more often prompts initiation and intensifi-\\ncation of preventive and anti-ischemic therapies \\nthan other diagnostic strategies. 6,89-96 Several \\nrandomized trials compared the effectiveness of \\nCCTA versus direct referral to ICA among symp-\\ntomatic patients. 1,5 From the CONSERVE trial, a \\nstrategy of initial CCTA was associated with lower \\ncost but similar 1-year MACE rates (death, ACS, \\nstroke, urgent/emergency coronary revasculariza-\\ntion, or cardiac hospitalization) as direct ICA (4.6% \\nversus 4.6%).5\\nStress Testing\\n2. The prognostic value of stress echocardiography \\nhas been demonstrated in large observational \\nseries with low rates of CAD events for patients \\nwith normal test results, particularly those with \\ngood exercise tolerance. 71,72,97-99 In the PROMISE \\ntrial, patients randomized to stress testing had \\nno difference in the primary outcome of death, \\nACS, or major procedural complications as com-\\npared to CCTA. 100 For stress nuclear imaging, \\nmulticenter registries support effective risk strati-\\nfication based on rest/stress measures of MPI \\nand left ventricular function, 13,21,27 ,28,98,101,102 with \\nrecent evidence on the prognostic value of stress \\nPET.26,37 ,38,103,104 Randomized trials have compared \\nthe effectiveness of rest/stress MPI with other \\nnoninvasive tests, such as CMR 105 and CCTA, \\nrevealing similar 1- to 3-year outcomes. Two mul-\\nticenter trials have evaluated the effectiveness of \\na CMR-guided strategy as compared to standard \\ntesting approaches. 34,35 The CE-MARC 2 multi-\\ncenter trial (n=1 202) revealed that both CMR and \\nSPECT MPI were associated with similar rates (ie, \\n7 .1%–7 .5%) of unnecessary invasive angiography \\n(defined as a no CAD stenosis ≥70% or a normal \\ninvasive FFR) compared with standard testing for \\nchest pain (28.8%; P<0.001).34 The MR-INFORM \\ntrial randomized 918 patients with typical angina \\nand multiple risk factors or a positive exercise ECG \\nto a CMR strategy versus invasive FFR strategy. 35 \\nThe CMR strategy was associated with less coro-\\nnary revascularization (P=0.005) and a similar \\nevent rate (death, AMI, or target vessel revascular-\\nization; P=0.91).\\n3.

From the ORBITA \\n(Objective Randomized Blinded Investigation With \\nOptimal Medical Therapy in Stable Angina) trial, \\nthere was a greater reduction in the stress echo-\\ncardiographic wall motion score among patients \\nwith single-vessel CAD treated with PCI compared \\nwith placebo (P<0.0001). 68 In a secondary analy-\\nsis, there was an interaction between the baseline \\nstress echocardiographic wall motion score and \\nthe efficacy of PCI for improved angina at 6 weeks \\nof follow-up.69 That is, PCI-treated patients with a \\nwall motion score ≥1 were more often angina-free \\ncompared with those in the placebo arm.\\n6. Evidence supports that the improved diagnostic \\naccuracy of PET MPI is helpful in the patient with \\nknown CAD. In a randomized trial of 322 symptom-\\natic patients with known CAD, the presence of low- \\nand high-risk stress PET findings was associated \\nwith lower and higher rates of ICA when compared \\nwith SPECT MPI (P =0.001).37 In this trial, nearly \\n1 in 5 patients with low-risk SPECT MPI findings \\nunderwent ICA, a rate more than twice that of \\nstress PET MPI. Based on such evidence, PET is \\npreferable over SPECT when both are available.\\n7 .

In these patients, perform-\\ning an ICA is reasonable when the angiographic \\nfindings have a high likelihood of impacting thera-\\npeutic decisions.1\\n2. Stable chest pain due to myocardial ischemia may \\noccur in patients with prior CABG because of pro-\\ngression of atherosclerosis in the native coronary \\narteries or within the bypass grafts.

Cost-Value Considerations in Diagnostic \\nTesting\\nA general concept regarding cost is that layered testing \\n(ie, when a test is followed by more tests) leads to higher \\ncosts. To minimize the potential needs for downstream \\ntesting, clinicians should select the test that is most likely \\nto answer a particular question.\\n5.3.1. CCTA and CAC Scanning Cost-Value \\nConsiderations\\nIn the outpatient setting, long-term costs were gener-\\nally similar between CCTA and stress testing strate-\\ngies.1 Higher invasive angiography rates after CCTA are \\nmatched by a greater use of downstream stress testing \\nafter initial stress testing, resulting in minimal differ-\\nences in cost at 2 to 3 years of follow-up. 1,2 From the  \\nCONSERVE (Coronary Computed Tomographic Angi-\\nography for Selective Cardiac Catheterization) trial, 823 \\npatients were randomized to a selective versus direct re-\\nferral strategy to ICA. Enrollment was limited to patients \\nwith nonemergent indications for ICA.3 The selective re-\\nferral arm included CCTA-guided use of ICA. Cumulative \\ndiagnostic costs were $1 183 for the selective arm and \\n$2755 for the direct referral arm of the CONSERVE trial \\n(57% lower costs). In the CCTA-guided arm, follow-up \\nstress testing was applied and contributed to reduced \\nreferrals to ICA.\\nA recent tiered testing strategy was evaluated \\nin both the CRESCENT I and II trials. 2,4 From the  \\nCRESCENT I trial, CAC was used as the index test, with \\nfollow-up CCTA used only in patients with detectable \\nCAC or for those with a high pretest risk. 2 In this trial, \\nnearly 40% of patients did not undergo CCTA, which \\nreduced diagnostic evaluation costs; no events were \\nreported in this subgroup. By comparison, nearly half of \\nthose randomized to the exercise ECG had additional \\nconfirmatory diagnostic testing. Overall, 1-year costs \\nwere significantly lower in the CAC tiered testing pro-\\ntocol (16% cost savings; P<0.0001). 2 Moreover, 1-year \\nMACE-free survival was higher in the CAC-guided \\ntesting arm (97%) compared with exercise ECG (90%; \\nHR: 0.32; P=0.011).\\n5.3.2. Exercise Electrocardiographic Cost-Value \\nConsiderations\\nThe economic evidence for the exercise ECG supports \\nthat tiered testing may offset its reduced diagnostic ac-\\ncuracy.1,2 In a decision model, tiered testing of exercise \\nECG followed by selective stress echocardiography re-\\nsulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and favorable \\ncost-effective ratios when compared with other testing \\nstrategies.2 In a Medicare cohort, observed 180-day \\ncosts were lowest for the exercise ECG when compared \\nwith stress echocardiography, MPI, or CCTA. 3 Ran-\\ndomized trial data on cost are available and from the \\nPROMISE trial initial test costs were $174 for exercise \\nECG, >50% lower than that of other imaging proce-\\ndures.4 At 3-years of follow-up, the mean cost difference \\nwas $1731 higher for CCTA (n=4818) when compared \\nwith the exercise ECG (n=858); however, the 95% \\nCIs for cost differences was wide ($2 to $3519), and \\nthere was no overall difference by randomization. 4 Over-\\nall, results from the PROMISE trial showed that stress \\ntesting was associated with similar costs and CAD out-\\ncomes over ∼ 3 years of follow-up. 4,5 In a randomized \\ntrial of 824 symptomatic women, cumulative procedural \\ncosts were nearly 50% lower for exercise ECG versus  \\nMPI SPECT (P<0.0001), with no difference in 2-year \\nevent-free survival (P=0.59).6\\n5.3.3. Stress Echocardiographic Cost-Value \\nConsiderations\\nSeveral cost-effectiveness models have reported an in-\\ncreased incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for stress \\nechocardiography, compared with exercise ECG and \\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on July 14, 2024\\n'),\n",

Stress Nuclear MPI Cost-Value \\nConsiderations\\nAmong intermediate-risk patients, evidence synthesis \\nsupports that stress MPI is a cost-effective test op-\\ntion.1 From the SPARC (Study of Myocardial Perfusion \\nand Coronary Anatomy Imaging Roles in Coronary Ar-\\ntery Disease) registry, observed 2-year mortality rate \\nwas highest for PET MPI (5.5%) compared with CCTA \\n(0.7%) or SPECT MPI (1.6%), with 2-year cost high-\\nest for patients undergoing PET. 2 In the PROMISE trial, \\nnearly two-thirds of patients underwent stress MPI, and \\nthe mean cost was similar when compared with CCTA. 3 \\nMean costs were also similar in a randomized trial of \\n457 patients comparing stress MPI with exercise ECG \\n(P>0.05).4 Among higher-likelihood patients in the UK \\nenrolled in the CECaT (Cost Effectiveness of Nonin-\\nvasive Cardiac Testing) trial, MPI SPECT was the most \\ncost-effective approach. 5\\n5.3.5. Stress CMR Cost-Value Considerations\\nA synthesis of this cost evidence reveals a pattern \\nwhereby CMR perfusion and scar imaging is associat-\\ned with a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ra-\\ntio of <$50 000 per quality-adjusted life years saved. 1,2 \\nFrom a single report, a CMR strategy informed by the  \\nCE-MARC trial was more cost-effective than stress \\nMPI, largely because of the higher diagnostic accuracy \\nfor CMR. 2 However, the most cost-effective strategy \\nwas that of initial exercise ECG followed by selective \\nstress CMR and invasive angiography; for this tiered \\ntesting approach, additional testing was deemed ap-\\npropriate in the setting of abnormal or inconclusive \\nfindings. In a decision model for intermediate pretest \\nrisk patients, a strategy of CMR followed by selec-\\ntive ICA had projected reduced costs by ∼ 25% when \\ncompared with direct referral to ICA. 2,3 From the Stress \\nCMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States registry, 4 \\npatients with negative findings for ischemia and scar \\nhad low downstream costs. 5\\n6. EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE \\nRESEARCH\\nChest pain is one of the most common symptoms for \\nwhich a person seeks medical care, and it should there-\\nfore be the target of substantial research investigation.\\n1. For patients with ACS, considerable success has \\nbeen achieved in reducing door-to-balloon times \\nfor STEMI, but little progress has been made in \\nreducing the important delays from symptom onset \\nto presentation. Further research is needed to \\ndevelop approaches to shorten this interval includ-\\ning studies of other methods of evaluating patients \\nwith chest pain using technologies that permit \\nacquisition and transmission of ECGs from home \\nand remote evaluations (eg, telehealth) for those \\nwith acute symptoms.1,2\\n2. An important, increasing patient population \\nincludes women and men with angina and ACS \\nassociated with angiographically normal or non-\\nobstructive coronary arteries. 3,4 Prognosis is not \\nbenign, pathophysiology has not been clarified, \\nand optimal therapy is unclear in these hetero-\\ngeneous groups, which are now considered in \\nterms of INOCA 5 and MINOCA. 6 Adequately \\nidentifying patients with INOCA, and completing \\nan evaluation to make such a diagnosis, is nec-\\nessary but often not done, regardless of whether \\nchest pain is assessed in the ED, inpatient, or \\noutpatient setting. Further investigation to clarify \\ndisease mechanisms in these challenging syn-\\ndromes is needed to provide the basis for thera-\\npeutic advances.\\n3. One of the initial challenges in the evaluation \\nof patients with chest pain, either in the emer-\\ngency or office setting, is symptom classification. \\nMethods to elicit symptoms and clusters of symp-\\ntoms that provide improved pretest probabilities \\nof symptomatic CAD may be aided with machine-\\nlearning algorithms. It is already clear that some \\ncommon dogma about chest pain descriptions, \\nsuch as differences between men and women, \\nmay not be as prevalent as has been reported 7 \\nand may impede care of both sexes if they do \\nnot fit preconceived notions of the clinical sig-\\nnificance of their symptoms. However, reducing \\nthe differences in both sex and racial differences \\nin treatment and outcomes are important future \\ngoals of research and clinical care.\\n4. Clinical risk stratification and decision tools will \\nlikely continue to grow in popularity because they \\nare incorporated into electronic health records, \\nbut it would be useful to test them in large \\nrandomized trials to rigorously determine their \\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on July 14, 2024\\n'),\n",

Trials evalu-\\nating various medical and procedural strategies \\nwould be useful including diagnostic and thera-\\npeutic algorithms for MINOCA. The number of \\npotential questions that could be addressed will \\ndemand innovative trial designs to use resources \\nefficiently and meaningfully.\\n5. Increasingly, randomized trials will be performed \\nto determine which diagnostic tests can be \\neliminated from initial and follow-up care, both \\nto streamline management algorithms and to \\ndecrease health care costs. In part, this approach \\nwill encompass evaluation of where patients with \\nchest pain should be initially evaluated and moni-\\ntored. Comparison of the various imaging modali-\\nties in randomized trials should help refine test \\nselection and use. 8\\nThus, the diagnosis and management of chest \\npain will remain a fertile area of investigation, with \\nrandomized evaluations complementing insights \\nprovided by registries of patients presenting with \\nchest pain.9-12 In the future, registries will more fre-\\nquently serve as platforms within which to conduct \\nrandomized trials. Accreditation activities coupled \\nwith registry participation will also need to be eval-\\nuated to determine if they not only improve pro-\\ncesses of care but also affect clinical endpoints. 12 \\nAssessment of long-term outcomes, patient-\\ncentered metrics, and cost will be integrated into \\nthese studies to enhance the evidence base for \\ncare of patients presenting with chest pain with \\ngreater precision.\\nACC/AHA JOINT COMMITTEE MEMBERS\\nPatrick T.

Re-\\ncurrent headaches are reported in\\none-third to one-half of children and\\nadolescents and occur daily or near\\ndaily in about 2% to 6% of young pa-\\ntients.1Y3 However, after the evaluation\\nfor secondary causes of headache is\\ncompleted, most children with a pri-\\nmary headache syndrome are left un-\\ntreated or undertreated. Pharmaceutical\\nstudies often exclude individuals un-\\nder the age of 18 from clinical trials.\\nSeveral studies have observed that medi-\\ncation is often only a small part of the\\ntreatment plan, as thorough identifica-\\ntion, education, and nonpharmacologic\\ntherapies show significant benefit.\\nIDENTIFICATION OF HEADACHE\\nIdentification of a primary headache in\\na child is the first step to effective\\ntreatment. It has been difficult for\\nboth parents and health professionals\\nto accurately identify children with\\nprimary headache. It is commonly be-\\nlieved that children do not get mi-\\ngraines, that their headaches are not\\ndisabling, or that they are feigning the\\nsymptoms. Children get migraines as\\nwell as other forms of primary head-\\nache syndromes, and migraine variants\\ncan present before the first birthday.\\nMost patients with migraine report onset\\nof headaches before the age of 20,\\nand 12% report onset before age 7.4,5\\nAmong children ultimately diagnosed\\nwith a primary headache syndrome,\\n21% are previously misdiagnosed by a\\nhealth care professional, including neu-\\nrologists. The time to correct diagnosis\\nis 1 year on average and increases to\\n3 years if a child has been previously\\nmisdiagnosed.6\\nHistory and Physical\\nExamination\\nIn children, the ability to describe the\\nheadache is limited by their develop-\\nmental stage.

The\\nprimary goal of the interview is to\\neliminate any red flags for secondary\\nheadaches (discussed in detail in the\\narticle ‘‘Secondary Headaches’’ in this\\nissue of ) and to obtain\\nenough information to make the diag-\\nnosis of a primary headache. It is\\nimportant to determine the impact of\\nthe condition on school and extracur-\\nricular activities, including the number\\nof school days missed in a given time\\nperiod. Efforts should be made to\\ndetermine additional stressors at school\\nthat contribute to recurrent headache.\\nA thorough review of lifestyle practices,\\nincluding caffeine intake, regularity of\\nmeals, sleep habits, and exercise, is im-\\nportant in identifying possible sources\\nof modification. Lastly, the pediatric\\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale\\ncan be helpful in determining the im-\\npact of headaches on the child.\\nIn addition to the standard neuro-\\nlogic examination, a comprehensive\\nheadache examination that evaluates\\nfor specific headache alterations is use-\\nful.7 Also, it is important to measure\\nhead circumference to identify macro-\\ncephaly, which could be associated\\nwith hydrocephalus, and to look for\\nneurocutaneous stigmata. A thorough\\nophthalmic examination is necessary to\\nlook for papilledema.\\nFurther Testing\\nThe guidelines for imaging in pediatric\\nheadache differ from those for adults\\nand were set forth in a practice param-\\neter by the AAN in 2002. In most cases,\\nneuroimaging is not necessary. The\\nrecommendation is to consider neuro-\\nimaging if there is an abnormality on\\nthe neurologic examination, a change\\nin the character or frequency of preex-\\nisting headaches, recent onset of se-\\nvere headache, associated features that\\nsuggest neurologic dysfunction, or co-\\nexistence of seizures. Imaging is not\\nroutine for patients with unchanging\\nrecurrent headaches and a normal\\nexamination.8 Head imaging in pedia-\\ntrics often requires discussion about\\nthe radiation exposure with CT or the\\nneed for sedation with MRI. In nearly\\nall cases MRI is the preferred method-\\nology. Children are particularly vulner-\\nable to the radiation of CT examinations\\ngiven their size and longer lifespan.\\nUsing data from atomic bomb survivors,\\nt h ec a l c u l a t e dr i s ko fh e a dC To nt h e\\nlifetime attributable risk of death from\\ncancer for children younger than age 15\\nis 0.01% to 0.075%.9 This risk needs\\nto be weighed against the benefits of\\ndetecting a lesion that may change the\\nmanagement approach. The rate of\\nabnormalities found on standard imag-\\ning for headache is between 14% and\\n28%, but the headache can be attrib-\\nuted to the abnormality found in only\\n10% to 30%.10\\nSecondary Headaches\\nMost secondary headaches in children\\nare similar to those found in adults.\\nParticular concern should be raised in\\nchildren of a young age (younger than\\n6 years), those with a history of neuro-\\ncutaneous syndromes, and those with\\nsigns and symptoms suggesting in-\\ncreased intracranial pressure. In up to\\n90% of cases, the cause of secondary\\nheadache is a viral or streptococcal up-\\nper respiratory tract infection.

Brain tumors are the\\nsecond most common malignancy in\\nchildhood and the most common solid\\ntumor in children, with about 2200\\nnew cases per year.12 Headache is the\\nmost common presenting symptom and\\ncan occur in isolation, but it is often\\naccompanied by vomiting, unsteadi-\\nness, or focal weakness.

Oph-\\nthalmoplegic migraine was previously\\nclassified as a childhood migraine var-\\niant with partial or total paralysis of one\\nof the nerves supplying eye movements.\\nThe third nerve is most commonly in-\\nvolved, accompanied by headache. This\\nsyndrome is now recognized as a cranial\\nneuralgia. The paralysis is often respon-\\nsive to a brief course of corticosteroids.\\nOphthalmoplegic migraine is rare, but\\nas more cases are reported because of\\nthe availability of modern imaging\\nmethods, the classification has been\\nreconsidered. Several case series dem-\\nonstrated contrast enhancement of the\\naffected nerve during an attack. The\\nophthalmoplegia can present or persist\\ndays or weeks after the headache re-\\nsolves. The International Classification\\nof Headache Disorders, Second Edition\\n(ICHD-II) has reclassified ophthalmo-\\nplegic migraine as a neuralgia, defined\\nas at least two attacks with migrainelike\\nheadache accompanied by or followed\\nwithin 4 days of onset by paresis of one\\nor more of the third, fourth, or sixth\\ncranial nerves with parasellar, orbital\\nfissure, and posterior fossa lesions ex-\\ncluded.15 This new classification is con-\\ntroversial; not all cases show nerve\\nenhancement and, when studied, CSF\\ndoes not suggest inflammation. Oph-\\nthalmoplegic migraine is seen in indi-\\nviduals with a personal or family history\\nof migraine, and the headache is felt to\\nbe a prominent part of the syndrome.16\\nBoth primary and secondary forms have\\nbeen described. The primary form, pos-\\nsibly seen more frequently in adults, is\\nlikely a variant of migraine with the\\nophthalmoplegia as a form of aura.\\nThe secondary form is demyelinating\\nand is seen in patients with enhance-\\nment of the nerve on MRI and a more\\nprotracted course. This form may re-\\nquire the use of corticosteroids.17\\nPrimary Headaches\\nThe prevalence of migraine is about 10%\\nfor girls and about 5% for boys (7%\\noverall), the prevalence of tension-type\\nheadache is 0.9% to 24%,2,3 and the\\nprevalence of chronic daily headache is\\n3.5%.18 Headache can significantly affect\\na child’s quality of life, impacting both\\neducation and play.

Although\\ntransformed migraine is the headache\\ntype of most patients, it accounts for only\\n69% of headaches in adolescents com-\\npared to 87% in adults.5 Because children\\nand adolescents with chronic migraine\\nmay have a history of sexual abuse, in-\\nquiry is appropriate.22 Similar to adults,\\nthis population is underserved, with over\\n60% not visiting a health care provider\\nabout their headaches in the past year\\nand less than 20% taking prevention.18\\nMigraine Variants\\nThe term migraine variants is used\\nto describe syndromes that appear in\\nchildren with a family history of mi-\\ngraine and in children who later de-\\nvelop migraine (Table 8-1). The reason\\nthese variants occur in childhood is\\nunknown. These conditions can be seen\\nin adulthood, and differences from mi-\\ngraine in proposed pathophysiology\\nmay exist.\\nCyclic vomiting syndrome. Cyclic\\nvomiting syndrome (CVS) is character-\\nized by stereotyped episodes of in-\\ntense vomiting followed by periods of\\ncomplete resolution. Triggers of CVS\\nin children include lack of sleep, co-\\nexisting illness, and stress. The preva-\\nlence of CVS is between 0.04% and\\n2%. The average age at onset is ap-\\nproximately 5 years, although CVS is\\nseen in children as young as 1 month\\nand is identified even in adults. CVS\\ngenerally resolves 10 years after onset,\\nand approximately 20% to 75% of af-\\nfected children will develop migraines.\\nAcute treatment focuses on sleep induc-\\ntion with benzodiazepines.

The patient did not want to talk with the neurologist but when asked, ‘‘Where is your\\nheadache?’’ pointed to the front of his head and drew a picture (Figure 8-1). His mother reported that\\nduring a headache he would become pale, stop his activity, and\\ncomplain of a stomachache. All he wanted to do was lie down, and\\nafter a 45-minute nap he would awaken feeling normal. Including\\nthe nap, the total length of the headache was about 1 hour. The\\nmother had been instructed by her pediatrician to give him\\nacetaminophen, but it did not seem to help. She had to pick him up\\nfrom school at least once per month. From age 3 until last year he\\nhad an unknown severe gastrointestinal illness characterized by\\nseveral days of repeated vomiting. A gastroenterologist had\\nevaluated him, but none of the tests, including endoscopy, was\\nrevealing. The patient and mother had a history of motion sickness,\\nand his maternal grandmother had headaches. The patient’s\\nexamination was normal.\\nComment. This is a typical description of a child with migraine.\\nMigraines in young children are of shorter duration, often bilateral,\\nand respond well to sleep. Sometimes children are unable or\\nunwilling to describe the headache, so use of drawings may be\\ninformative and parental observations are important. A history of\\nmigraine comorbidities, such as motion sickness or migraine variant,\\ncan help strengthen a diagnosis. In this case, the repeated episodes\\nof gastrointestinal illness with negative workup may be cyclic\\nvomiting syndrome. The examination is normal and the headache\\nfrequency is stable so this child does not need imaging. Treatment should begin with a review of\\ntriggers and lifestyle practices to determine modifications and a referral to biofeedback. In order to\\nminimize school absences, arrangements should be made with the school staff to allow the patient to\\nnap during a headache and return to class when he recovers. In addition, acute medication should be\\nmade available as early as possible, including keeping medication in his desk if deemed appropriate. It\\nis important to review proper dosing with the parents. A triptan may be of value if ibuprofen or\\nacetaminophen is ineffective.\\nFIGURE 8-1 Drawing from an\\n8-year-old boy\\nwhen asked where his headache\\nwas.\\nCourtesy of Kathleen Farmer, PsyD, and\\nRoger Cady, MD, Springfield, Missouri.\\n857Continuum Lifelong Learning Neurol 2012;18(4):853–868 www.aan.com/continuum\\nCopyright @ American Academy of Neurology.

It is important to iden-\\ntify them as they may alter management.\\nMood disorders. In adults a strong\\nassociation exists between migraine\\nand many mood disorders, including\\ndepression, bipolar disorder, and anxi-\\nety. In children, reports show an in-\\ncreased risk of suicidality.33 A recent\\nlarge systematic review shows that chil-\\ndren with migraine seen in tertiary care\\ncenters do not have greater psycholog-\\nical dysfunction or more comorbid psy-\\nchiatric diagnoses than healthy controls.34\\nScreening for mood disorders is recom-\\nm e n d e d ,a n d ,i fad i s o r d e ri d e n t i f i e d ,\\naggressive treatment should ensue.\\nObesity.

In patients who are at risk for\\noverweight and obesity, a reduction in\\nBMI will lead to a reduction in head-\\nache frequency.36\\nSleep disturbance. The most com-\\nmon trigger for headaches in children\\nis impaired sleep.37 Children with mi-\\ngraine report poorer sleep quality, more\\ndaytime sleepiness, longer sleep laten-\\ncies, and reduced total sleep duration\\ncompared to individuals without mi-\\ngraine. Evidence shows that patients\\nwith migraine, particularly those who\\nare overweight, have increased rates\\nof sleep-disordered breathing and a\\nhigher rate of parasomnias.38 Higher\\nheadache frequencies are positively as-\\nsociated with poorer sleep quality, and\\nthis association does not resolve when\\npreventive migraine medications are\\nused, suggesting that an underlying al-\\nteration in normal sleep patterns may\\nbe present in patients with migraine.39\\nOther Periodic Syndromes\\nof Childhood\\nChildren with migraine commonly\\nvoice other concerns that do not\\nnecessarily alter management but\\nKEY POINT\\nh Sleep is frequently\\ndisturbed in children\\nwith migraine, and\\nthey have a high\\nprevalence of\\nsleep-disordered\\nbreathing.\\nHeadaches in Children\\n862 www.aan.com/continuum August 2012\\nCopyright @ American Academy of Neurology.

The prevalence of fre-\\nquent headache, defined as more than two headaches per\\nmonth, affects approximately 17 % of the elderly [2, 3]. Half\\nof elderly patients who presented to a tertiary headache center\\nwere referred for an evaluation of a new headache [4\\x81]. In one\\nstudy, a daily headache was present in 3.9 % of a cohort of\\nelderly individuals [5]. The majority of the headaches in the\\nelderly are primary disorders (66 %) [6]( F i g .1). However,\\nheadaches from serious causes are more common in those\\nover age 65 and can comprise up to 15 % of new-onset head-\\naches, significantly increased from an estimated 1.6 % for\\nthose under age 65 [7]. The headache types, presentation,\\nand treatment options also change with advancing age. The\\nterm elderly is defined differently depending on region or\\nculture; however, for the purpose of this review, the World\\nHealth Organization definition of age≥60 years will be used\\n[8]. This review provides an updated overview of the preva-\\nlent or concerning headaches types, including primary head-\\nache disorders, secondary headache disorders, and neuralgias\\nfacing the elderly.\\nPrimary Headaches\\nMigraine\\nMigraine remains the second most common primary headache\\ndiagnosis, behind tension-type headache, even among the el-\\nderly. A quarter of elderly patients presenting for tertiary head-\\nache referral are seen for an International Classification of\\nHeadache Disorders (ICHD) 2 primary diagnosis of migraine\\n[4\\x81]. While migraine may begin to remit in the late fifth to\\nsixth decade [9, 10], the annual prevalence of migraine over\\n65 years of age is still approximately 10 % [3, 11]. New-onset\\nmigraine at age over 60 is said to be rare and should prompt an\\nevaluation for a secondary cause [7, 11]. However, new-onset\\nmigraine in the fifth decade is not rare; in one study, 19 % of\\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection onHeadache\\n* Thomas P.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\elderlyHeadaches.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='women were noted to have onset of migraine without aura\\nafter age 50 [12]. Migraine phenotype does change with time\\nand is more likely to be described as bilateral or global with\\ndecreasing associated features including photophobia,\\nphonophobia, nausea, and vomiting [13]. Elderly patients\\nmay note increase in associated neck pain, bilateral\\nrhinorrhea, and lacrimation, but will often have better re-\\nsponse to medication, including more mild headache days\\nand greater ability to function during the attack [14]. This\\nchange in phenotype may be in part responsible for the in-\\ncrease in diagnosis as tension-type headache as compared to\\nmigraine seen in a recent study [4\\x81]( F i g .1).\\nWhile the treatment approaches to migraine in the elderly\\nare similar to those in the general population, care must be\\ntaken to select acute and preventative medications considering\\ncomorbidities. Unfortunately, most studies of migraine treat-\\nment exclude patients over 65, contributing to a deficit of\\npublished data in this population [15]. Vasoactive substances,\\nsuch as triptans or dihydroergotamine, should not be pre-\\nscribed to patients with known cardiovascular disease includ-\\ning stroke, or multiple vascular risk factors. However, in indi-\\nviduals that are at low cardiovascular risk, despite age, triptans\\nshould still be considered for acute treatment [16, 17\\x81]. Extra\\ncaution must be taken regarding side effect profile, particular-\\nly cognitive and autonomic considerations, when selecting\\nmigraine preventative medications, but this should not pre-\\nclude their general use [11].\\nAura Without Headache\\nICHD-3beta defines typical aura without headache as an aura\\nconsisting of visual, sensory, and/or speech language\\nsymptoms that are fully reversible meeting at least two of four\\ntypical migraine aura characteristics [18\\x81\\x81]. A large collection\\nof cases of transient spells closely resembling migraine auras,\\noften without headache, occurring in the first time in patients\\nover the age of 45 was extensively described by the landmark\\npaper by C Miller Fisher [19]. Originally described asBlate-\\nlife migraine accompaniments^ of the 205 cases, 36 % were\\n>60 years of age [20]. Various auras were described, but\\namong the most common among an elderly population were\\nvisual aura followed by paresthesias, aphasia, dysarthria, and\\nhemiplegia [21, 22]. While often described as a benign TIA\\nmimic, recent reports have suggested that hemosiderin depo-\\nsition may precipitate cortical spreading depression as a po-\\ntential cause for these attacks. In two different series, four\\npatients were found to have acute convexity subarachnoid\\nhemorrhage associated with these aura-like symptoms [23,\\n24]. New-onset aura-like symptoms in an elderly patient\\nshould prompt evaluation for secondary causes including\\nTIA, seizure, and intracranial hemorrhage [25\\x81]( T a b l e1).\\nHypnic Headache\\nHypnic headache is a rare primary headache that occurs pri-\\nmarily on average at age 60 [26\\x81, 27]. It is estimated that,\\nwhile rare, it may comprise 1.7 % of elderly patients present-\\ning for tertiary headache referral [4\\x81]. The ICHD-3beta de-\\nscribes hypnic headache (HH) as a frequently occurring head-\\nache developing only during sleep, causing awakening and\\nlasting up to 4 h without other characteristics [ 18\\x81\\x81].\\nPreviously described asBalarm clock headache,^ it is classi-\\ncally a dull, minor to moderate, bilateral headache lasting\\nseveral hours that awakens the patient from sleep with the\\nFig. 1 Comparison of headache\\ntypes by age presenting for\\ntertiary headache evaluation.\\nAdapted from Ruiz et al.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\elderlyHeadaches.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='absence of migrainous and cranial autonomic features. A re-\\ncent review of the literature examined the characteristics of\\npublished cases and found that HH may differ in several sig-\\nnificant ways as compared to original description and current\\nproposed criteria. The review noted that the HH does occa-\\nsionally occur with less prominent cranial autonomic features\\n(2–7 %), is most often sharp/stabbing/burning (68 %) as com-\\npared to dull (26 %), and is of moderate to severe intensity\\n(94 %). Additionally, the review noted that while overt rest-\\nlessness was not present, which would suggest a trigeminal\\nautonomic cephalalgia, patients did often report initiating a\\nmotor activity following an attack (97 %) [26\\x81].\\nHH-like presentation has been reported secondary to tu-\\nmors of the posterior fossa and pituitary tumors. In addition,\\nnocturnal arterial hypertension, angiotensin-converting en-\\nzyme inhibitor medications, and one insolated case of obstruc-\\ntive sleep apnea have also been reported [26\\x81]. An MRI of the\\nbrain, an evaluation for nocturnal hypertension, and a review\\nof medications should be considered as part of the evaluation\\nfor HH. In addition, other primary headache disorders that\\nhave a nocturnal predominance, such as cluster headache,\\nshould be considered. Treatment recommendations are based\\non limited evidence but most prominently recommend noctur-\\nnal caffeine, 60 mg or approximately one cup of coffee, as an\\nacute treatment. For prevention, regular caffeine before bed,\\nlithium, and indomethacin have all been described as being\\neffective [27].\\nPrimary Cough Headache\\nPrimary cough or Valsalva maneuver headache is another rare\\nprimary headache disorder that occurs with a mean age above\\n60 [28, 29]. It is defined as a headache that is precipitated by\\ncoughing or other Valsalva maneuver, but not exercise, in the\\nabsence of a secondary cause. The headache is described as\\nmoderate to severe, explosive, and brief (<30 s) with a dull\\npain that can last up to 2 h [18\\x81\\x81]. Often, symptoms of an upper\\nrespiratory tract infection precede the onset. The presence of a\\ncough-induced headache should compel evaluation for a\\npotential serious secondary cause. Symptomatic Chiari type\\n1 malformations are the most common secondary cause; how-\\never, in an older population, an intracranial tumor, particularly\\nof the posterior fossa, should be considered. Other potential\\nsecondary causes in the literature include unruptured intracra-\\nnial aneurysms, dissection, carotid/vertebrobasilar stenosis,\\nacute sphenoid sinusitis, CSF volume depletion, and subdural\\nhematoma [29, 30]. No consistent headache profile, including\\nresponse to indomethacin, can differentiate between primary\\nand secondary cough headache, and brain and vascular imag-\\ning is highly recommended. Despite the potential for a serious\\nsecondary cause, most cases of cough headache in an older\\npopulation are primary in nature, with secondary causes being\\nmore common at younger ages [29].\\nThe natural history in primary cough headache is still not\\nwell understood. Those that have initial response to treatment\\n(81 %) were pain free at 6 months without recurrence. Those\\nthat were treatment resistant were more likely to have persis-\\ntent pain; however,∼42 % of these patients spontaneously\\nremitted from 6 months to 2 years [29]. The treatment of\\nchoice is indomethacin. Therapeutic lumbar puncture and ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid drainage has also been demonstrated to be\\neffective [28, 29].\\nSecondary Headaches\\nSleep Apnea Headache\\nSleep apnea headache is defined as a morning headache, usu-\\nally bilateral, lasting less than 4 h, occurring with the diagno-\\nsis and improving with the treatment of sleep apnea. Sleep\\napnea is defined as having an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI)\\nof ≥5[ 18\\x81\\x81]. While sleep apnea is considered to have a peak\\nincidence in middle-aged adulthood, the prevalence continues\\nto increase with age [31]. In a general Norwegian population,\\nan AHI of≥5 (indicating sleep apnea) was most prevalent in\\nthe sixth decade of life (36.1 %), the oldest age group included\\nin that study [32\\x81]. Sleep apnea headache occurs in approxi-\\nmately 11.8 % of those with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\\nwith earlier studies suggesting a higher prevalence ranging\\nfrom 15.2 to 18 % [33]. Although controversial, some recent\\nstudies suggest the severity of sleep apnea does not correlate\\nwith an increased prevalence of sleep apnea headache.\\nAdditionally, approximately 5 % of patients in a Norwegian\\ngeneral population had morning headache but did not have\\nsleep apnea [32\\x81].\\nThe pathophysiology of sleep apnea headache remains un-\\nclear but is not solely related to oxygen desaturation and likely\\nhas additional factors [33]. A prior history of a primary head-\\nache disorder is more common in those with sleep apnea\\nheadache compared to those with OSA who do not develop\\nheadache. Treatment includes adequately treating the sleep\\nTable 1 Typical clinical features of late-life migraine accompaniment\\nVisual symptoms (e.g., scintillating scotomas) over 15 to 60 min\\nGradual migration of scintillation with involvement of both visual fields\\nMarch of paresthesias, often hand and face over 20 to 30 min\\nProgression of one accompaniment to another or from one body part\\nto another\\nOccurrence of≥2 similar spells\\nHeadache in association with spells\\nAverage duration of spell 15 to 30 min\\nOccurrence in 5th to 6th decade with identical spells over 5 to 10 years\\nBenign course with exclusion of secondary causes\\nAdapted from V ongvaivanich et al.[25\\x81]\\nCurr Neurol Neurosci Rep (2015) 15:30 Page 3 of 9 30 '),\n",

In one observational study, treatment with nasal CPAP\\nprovided headache resolution in 90 % of patients [34]. If there\\nis no response to treatment, other early-morning primary head-\\nache disorders, such as hypnic headache, cluster headache,\\nand caffeine withdrawal headache, should be considered.\\nOther secondary causes of headache should also be excluded\\nincluding conditions that may cause increased intracranial\\npressure which can be worsened by periods in the supine\\nposition.\\nHeadache Attributed to Giant Cell Arteritis\\nHeadache is the most common symptom experienced by pa-\\ntients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) reported in 73 %, and in\\n35 %, it is the presenting symptom [35]. GCA, previously\\nreferred to as temporal arteritis, should always be considered\\nas a possible secondary cause of headache in those presenting\\nwith new or changed headache over age 50 [36]. The inci-\\ndence of GCA increases progressively with age. Beginning in\\nthe age group 50–59, the incidence is 1.4 per 100,000, increas-\\ning to 10.7 per 100,00 in ages 60–69 and may be as high as\\n1100 per 100,00 in patients 85 years of age and above [37].\\nGCA is a medium- and large-vessel vasculitis that predomi-\\nnates, but is not isolated to, the cranial arteries. Unrecognized\\nGCA can cause blindness from posterior ciliary artery in-\\nvolvement leading to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.\\nAdditionally, GCA can cause a variety of other complications\\nincluding other cranial neuropathies, large artery stenosis, aor-\\ntic dissection/aneurysm, and rarely stroke [36]. GCA is also\\nassociated with polymyalgia rheumatica in approximately half\\nof cases [38].\\nThe diagnosis of GCA is guided by the American College\\nof Rheumatology criteria which require three of five primary\\nfeatures to be present. This includes age 50 years or older, a\\nnew headache, a clinical temporal artery abnormality, an ele-\\nvated ESR of 50 mm/h (may be age dependent), and/or an\\nabnormal temporal artery biopsy [39]. The gold standard for\\ndiagnosis is the temporary artery biopsy which should be con-\\nsidered in all suspected cases. In addition to a thorough histo-\\nry, including the presence of jaw claudication and a temporal\\nand extra-temporal vascular examination [40], various imag-\\ning modalities may also be helpful in the diagnosis. A recent\\nreview of color Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated a high\\nspecificity for GCA (91 %) when perivascular hypoechoic\\nabnormalities (halo sign) were present in the temporal artery\\nand large vessels. However, this was balanced with a low\\nsensitivity (68 %) [41]. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR\\nimages may also be helpful; in a recent prospective study, MR\\nimaging had a diagnostic sensitivity of 78.4 % and specificity\\nof 90.4 % with yield decreasing after 5 days of corticosteroids\\n[42].\\nIf GCA is suspected, patients should be treated promptly.\\nConfirmatory testing, such as biopsy, should be arranged early\\n(ideally within the first 7 days) into treatment when possible to\\nincrease diagnostic yield; however, a biopsy should not delay\\ntreatment. The mainstay of treatment remains corticosteroids.\\nRecent consensus guidelines on management have been rec-\\nommended by the European League Against Rheumatism and\\nemphasize the immediate need for corticosteroid treatment\\n[43].\\nCardiac Cephalalgia\\nCardiac cephalalgia is defined as aBmigraine-like^ headache\\nthat usually, but not always, is precipitated by exertion, occur-\\nring during an episode of myocardial ischemia. In contrast to\\nother headache disorders, it is relieved by nitroglycerine\\n[18\\x81\\x81]. It is a rare secondary headache disorder, with less than\\n50 cases reported in the literature, but up to a nearly third of\\nthose cases presented with headache as their sole manifesta-\\ntion of myocardial ischemia [44]. In one literature review, the\\nmean age of presentation was 62.5(±12.7)years of age with\\nheadache being the singular presenting manifestation more\\noften with increasing age [45]. The headache is often heterog-\\nenous and may occur in any area of the head and may be\\nunilateral or bilateral. The pain is almost always severe and\\na thunderclap presentation has been described. Additional fea-\\ntures such as photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea occur in\\napproximately a third. Usually, the headache occurs immedi-\\nately upon exertion, but 33 % of reported cases have occurred\\nat rest. Baseline cardiac tests may potentially be normal and\\nabnormalities may only be apparent upon stress testing [44].\\nThe headache is usually responsive to nitroderivatives, a\\nunique feature among headache disorders and which typically\\naggravates migraine. In all reported cases, the headache re-\\nsolves after revascularization or treatment of myocardial is-\\nchemia but may recur upon coronary restenosis [45, 46].\\nAlthough rare, in older patients presenting with exertional\\nheadache, especially with additional cardiovascular risk fac-\\ntors, evaluation for myocardial ischemia should be\\nconsidered.\\nHeadache Attributed to Subacute Glaucoma\\nAcute angle closure glaucoma is an urgent sight-threatening\\ncondition due to an acute rise in intraocular pressure second-\\nary to obstruction of the aqueous outflow at the trabecular\\nmeshwork. It classically presents with acute unilateral ocular\\npain, eye redness, visual change (often seeingBhalos around\\nlights^), and a mid-dilated unreactive pupil but can be de-\\nscribed initially by a patient as a unilateral severe headache\\n[47]. However, a more insidious presentation of elevated in-\\ntraocular pressure is subacute angle closure glaucoma\\n(SACG), an intermittent form of glaucoma with recurrent ep-\\nisodes of elevated intraocular pressure lasting minutes to\\nhours. Unrecognized SACG can lead to gradual optic nerve\\n 30 Page 4 of 9 Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep  (2015) 15:30 '),\n",

SACG will most often present as mild\\nto moderate eye pain, with visual blurring often occurring in\\ndim light [48]. However, the condition may instead present\\nwith headache as a main or sole symptom of these attacks of\\nelevated intraocular pressure. A recent case review of cases of\\nSACG with headache as a primary presenting symptom noted\\na mean age of presentation of 60 years. The headache can be\\ndescribed as frontal, unilateral, or rarely diffuse. It may occur\\nwith nausea. It is typically nonpulsatile and without photopho-\\nbia. The length of the headache is minutes to several hours, but\\nless than 4 h. It may occur several times a month or as frequent\\nas daily. In one review, there was an average time of\\n2.6 years from presentation to diagnosis for which two\\nthirds were misdiagnosed as migraine despite not meet-\\ning criteria. Visual field loss was present in those who\\nhad symptoms longer (average 3.6 years). All patients\\nhad improvement or resolution of their headache with\\nlaser peripheral iridotomy [ 49, 50]. In patients present-\\ning with headaches of a few hours presenting in dim\\nlight conditions, especially with visual blurring or halos,\\nreferral for evaluation of elevated intraocular pressure\\nincluding gonioscopy is warranted.\\nMedication Overuse Headache\\nMedication overuse headach e (MOH) is currently de-\\nfined as a headache occurring 15 days or more per\\nmonth as a consequence of regular acute headache med-\\ni c a t i o nu s ef o r1 0t o1 5d a y sp e rm o n t h( d e p e n d i n go n\\nthe medication) for at least 3 months. By definition,\\nthere should be improvement or potential resolution af-\\nter stopping the medication [ 18\\x81\\x81]. MOH is prevalent\\nacross the general population occurring from 0.5 to\\n2.6 % [51\\x81]. Prevalence in an elderly population is no\\nexception, with prevalence ranging from 1.0 to 1.7 % in\\nthose 65 years or older. Similar to the general popula-\\ntion, medication overuse for headache in the elderly is a\\nsignificant risk factor for developing a daily headache\\nas well as transforming an episodic primary headache\\ndisorder, commonly episodic migraine, to a chronic pat-\\ntern [52, 53]. Elderly patients with a chronic daily head-\\nache, such as chronic migraine, are at higher risk for\\nsevere functional impairment and depression. Despite\\nthis potential disability, in one Chinese study, only one\\nquarter of patients with daily headache consulted a phy-\\nsician for evaluation [ 53]. When evaluating an elderly\\npatient with frequent headaches, a thorough history of\\nprescription and nonprescr iption medications should be\\nobtained. Simply withdrawing the overused medication\\nmay result in significant headache improvement at\\n2 months in approx. 50 % of patients [ 54]a n dm a y\\nresult in improved response to other headache treat-\\nm e n t sa sw e l l .\\nHeadache Attributed to Cranial or Cervical Vascular\\nDisorders and Nonvascular Intracranial Disorders\\nHeadache attributed to cranial or cervical vascular disorders\\nand headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorders\\nare both consecutive sections of the ICHD-3beta that comprise\\nmany of the worrisome secondary causes of headache includ-\\ning subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, ische-\\nmic stroke, nontraumatic subdural hematoma, infection, and\\nintracranial neoplasm [18\\x81\\x81]. Given that the prevalence of all\\nthese conditions increases with age and many may present\\nwith headache as a prominent symptom, it is prudent that a\\nworrisome intracranial disorder be considered in the elderly\\npatient. In one review of patients presenting to a hospital for\\nheadache, the risk of a serious secondary cause increased ten-\\nfold in those age≥65 [7]. Worrisome features concerning for a\\nsinister secondary cause include the followingBred flags^:a g e\\nover 50,Bworst headache,^ systemic signs or symptoms (fe-\\nvers, chills, weight loss, etc.), neurologic signs or symptoms,\\nthunderclap onset (headache increasing to maximum intensity\\nin less than 1 min), sudden headache pattern change or new\\nheadache, or headache precipitated by change in position or\\nValsalva [55]( T a b l e2). In a review of cases of sudden death\\nthat presented with a chief complaint of headache, consistent\\nred flags included age >50 (55 % of cases), thunderclap head-\\nache, worst headache, and history of seizure/collapse/loss of\\nconsciousness. The majority of the all-age deaths (60 %) re-\\nsulted from vascular events (aneurysm rupture, intracranial\\nhemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, GCA, and dissec-\\ntion) with the remainder from tumor (17 %), meningitis (6 %),\\nand other (16 %) [56\\x81]. If red flags are present, in addition to a\\nfull neurologic evaluation, urgent neuroimaging should be\\nconsidered. Head CT may initially be appropriate in an emer-\\ngent setting; however, if available and patient is otherwise\\nstable, MRI is preferred. Vascular imaging and lumbar punc-\\nture should also be considered acutely, especially in cases of\\nthunder clap onset. Although often benign, the incidence of a\\nworrisome secondary cause for headache is increased in the\\nelderly and should receive careful attention especially in the\\npresence of the above red flags.\\nTable 2 Headache Bred flags^ for secondary causes\\nSystemic signs or symptoms Fevers, chills, myalgias, weight loss\\nNeurologic signs or symptoms Focal or mental status changes\\nOnset— sudden Sudden or thunderclap presentation\\nOnset— age Onset over 50\\nPattern change If prior history\\nProgressive\\nPrecipitated by Valsalva or\\nposition change\\nPapilledema\\nAdapted from Dodick[55]\\nCurr Neurol Neurosci Rep (2015) 15:30 Page 5 of 9 30 '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\elderlyHeadaches.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Cervicogenic Headache\\nCervicogenic headache is a controversial secondary headache\\ndisorder defined as a headache caused by a disorder of any\\ncomponent of the cervical spine with or without accompany-\\ning neck pain [18\\x81\\x81]. Despite the increase in cervical degener-\\native disease in the elderly , the overall incidence of\\ncervicogenic headache in one population review is 27.8 years\\nof age. However, in this study, subjects over 65 years of age\\nwere excluded [57]. It remains to be demonstrated that\\ncervicogenic headache is indeed more prevalent in an elderly\\npopulation. It is possible that the proposed secondary head-\\nache disorders headache attributed to upper cervical\\nradiculopathy and headache attributed to cervical myofascial\\npain may show an increased incidence in an elderly popula-\\ntion and is an area open for additional study. In selected cases\\nwith a headache with temporal relationship to a potential pro-\\nvoking disorder of the cervical spine, diagnostic and therapeu-\\ntic high cervical blocks may be considered. Elderly patients\\nwith posterior predominant head pain, especially with parox-\\nysmal attacks of sharp or throbbing pain and tenderness to\\npalpation along the greater, lesser, and/or third occipital\\nnerves, may have occipital neuralgia [18\\x81\\x81]. Occipital neural-\\ngia has been noted to occur in approximately 1.5 % of elderly\\npatients presenting for tertiary headache evaluation [4]. For\\nsuspected occipital neuralgia, a peripheral occipital nerve\\nblock should be considered which can be both diagnostic\\nand therapeutic.\\nNeuralgias\\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a short-lasting, paroxysmal, se-\\nvere shooting/stabbing/shock-like unilateral pain occurring\\nprimarily in the distribution along the second or third divisions\\nof the trigeminal nerve. Attacks are often precipitated by in-\\nnocuous tactile stimuli to the affected side of the face. TN is\\ncurrently divided into two general classifications. The first is\\nclassical TN which is either idiopathic or due to neurovascular\\ncompression, most frequently by the superior cerebellar artery.\\nThe second is painful trigeminal neuropathy which is due to a\\nstructural lesion such as demyelination from multiple sclero-\\nsis, space-occupying mass, or herpes zoster (acute or post-\\nherpetic neuralgia) [18\\x81\\x81]. While the onset of TN is typically\\nnot thought of as a condition that is predominately in an el-\\nderly population, the peak age of incidence does fall between\\nthe fifth and seventh decades [58]. In a recent study, classical\\nTN had an average age onset of 52.9 years; however, the\\naverage age of all patients studied was 62.3 years. The major-\\nity described the pain as significantly severe and many will\\nhave persistent facial pain in between attacks. Approximately\\n30 % of patients reported sensory abnormalities despite the\\nabsence of trigeminal neuropathy or surgical treatment [59\\x81].\\nIn a recent blinded prospective study using 3-T MRI,\\nneurovascular contact of the trigeminal nerve was prevalent\\nin patients with classical TN in both the symptomatic (89 %)\\nand asymptomatic (78 %) sides, with 70 % of patients having\\nbilateral neurovascular contact. Neurovascular contact graded\\nas severe was more predictive of the symptomatic (53 %)\\nversus asymptomatic (13 %) side when present (OR 11.6)\\n[60]. The significance of this is unclear but may provide\\nnew insight in the potential etiology of classical TN.\\nTreatment of classical TN is primarily through medications\\nwith surgical interventions considered for more refractory\\ncauses, although there are no available studies addressing\\nthe time course into treatment when a surgical procedure\\nshould be offered. Carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine titrations\\nare both considered first-line treatment for classical TN. There\\nis some evidence to suggest lamotrigine or baclofen may be\\nhelpful as well [61]. Care should be taken for appropriate\\nmonitoring of these medications, especially in an elderly pop-\\nulation. Recently, onabotulinumtoxinA injection has been\\nshown to be effective in reducing pain in a small placebo-\\ncontrolled trial [62]. Surgical techniques that are graded as\\npossibly effective include percutaneous gasserian ganglion\\nprocedures, gamma knife radiosurgery of the trigeminal root,\\nand neurovascular depression of the trigeminal root. However,\\nguidelines as to when to recommend a procedural interven-\\ntion, and which procedural intervention to recommend for\\nwhich patient with classical TN, have not yet been well\\nestablished [61].\\nPost-herpetic Trigeminal Neuropathy\\nHerpes zoster, or shingles, is a common reactivation of vari-\\ncella zoster virus (VZV) typically causing a painful vesicular\\neruption in a dermatomal distribution. While VZV reactiva-\\ntion is not an uncommon occurrence across multiple age\\ngroups, the incidence increases progressively in unvaccinated\\npersons above the age of 50 [63]. VZV reactivation presents in\\nthe cranial nerves from 13 to 30 % of cases, for which 80 %\\nare in the first division of the trigeminal nerve [64, 65].\\nAcutely, this may cause a painful trigeminal neuropathy which\\nmay present up to 7 days prior to the herpetic eruption [18\\x81\\x81].\\nAs a late consequence of reactivation, and a potential dis-\\nabling complication, post-herpetic neuralgia is a persistent\\nand often severe, debilitating pain that continues in the distri-\\nbution of the rash for at least 3 months after the rash has\\nresolved [63]. The probability of acute reactivation leading\\nto post-herpetic neuralgia also increases with age. In one trial,\\nthe incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia occurred in 6.9 % of\\nindividuals 60–60 years of age and increased to 18.5 % in\\nthose 70 or older [66].\\n 30 Page 6 of 9 Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep  (2015) 15:30 '),\n",

UVR carries higher\\nenergy than visible light and high dose\\nexposure to UVR causes direct cellular\\ndamage, which has an important role\\nin the development of cancer. This\\nreview provides an overview on the\\nmost recent knowledge on the role of\\nUVR in oxidative stress (OS) in rela-\\ntion to noncancer ocular pathologies: various corneal pathologies, cataract, glau-\\ncoma and age-related macular degeneration. Possible OS signaling streams and\\nmechanisms in the aging eye are discussed. Excessive exposure to UVR through\\nlive may seriously contribute to increase in OS of various eye tissues and thus lead\\nto the advancement of serious ocular pathologies. Children are especially vulnera-\\nble to UVR because of their larger pupils and more transparent ocular media: up\\nto 80% of a person's lifetime exposure to UVR is reached before the age of 18.\\nTherefore, efficient everyday protection of the sensitive tissues of the eye by wear-\\ning of sunglasses, clear UVR-blocking spectacles or contact lenses should be con-\\nsidered from early age on. Many initiatives are taken worldwide to inform and\\nraise the population's awareness about these possible UVR hazards to the eye.\\nKEYWORDS\\neye health, oxidative stress, ultraviolet radiation, UVA, UVB\\n1 | INTRODUCTION\\nVisual perception is a complex phenomenon that is initiated\\nwhen electromagnetic radiation from the sun reaches the ret-\\nina and the visible spectrum is converted from radiant\\nenergy into sensation by the phototransduction in the retinal\\nphotoreceptors. The ability to translate electromagnetic radi-\\nation into usable visual information relies on a complex\\ninteraction between the different structural and functional\\ncomponents of the eye and the brain. Electromagnetic\\nradiation has a dual wave-particle nature, but when it is\\nabsorbed by a photoreceptor at the retina, its particle nature\\nis dominant. The portions of the electromagnetic spectrum\\nthat interact with the eye are shown in Figure 1. They are\\nreferred to as optical radiation and include wavelengths\\nfrom ultraviolet (100-400 nm, UVR), visible light (400-\\n760 nm, VIS) to infrared (above 760 nm, IR) [1]. The Inter-\\nnational Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection\\n(ICNIRP) defines [2] several subgroups of ultraviolet or\\ninvisible radiation classified into UVA (315-400 nm), UVB\\n(280-315 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm).

We follow these subdivisions as\\nthey are useful for safety and hazard evaluations. They sep-\\narate the wavelengths into bands of roughly similar photon\\nenergy, tissue penetration and general classes of bio-effects.\\nVisible light is referred to as short (λ = 420 nm), medium\\n(λ = 530 nm) and long wavelength (λ = 560 nm) corre-\\nsponding to the peak absorption spectra of the cone visual\\npigments. Light is transmitted through the eye and then after\\nabsorption, scattering and transduction, the signals are com-\\npressed and send via the optic nerve to the brain directing\\nboth visual perception and circadian rhythm. Because of its\\nfunction and structure, the eye is most susceptible to light\\ndamage; it is designed to focus incoming light rays to form\\nimages on the neural retina. This has the effect of concen-\\ntrating the light or increasing the power density of light on\\nthe retina. Thus, light delivering a radiant exposure insuffi-\\ncient to produce skin damage may indeed cause injury when\\nfocused on the retina. The absorption spectrum of each ocu-\\nlar tissue [3, 4] must be taken into account to understand its\\ndifferential sensitivity with respect to wavelength\\n(Figure 1). The primary factors that determine whether\\nambient radiation will injure the human eye outside of\\ndefined laboratory conditions are: (1) the intensity of the\\nlight, (2) the wavelength received by ocular tissues and\\n(3) the age of the recipient [4]. In the eye, UVR is not\\nknown to contribute to visual perception and there are\\nstrong evidences that acute high dose exposure to UVR\\ncauses photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis, while even\\nlow dose chronic exposure to UVR is a risk factor for cata-\\nract, pterygium and squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea\\nand conjunctiva [5–7]. There is weaker evidence in relation\\nto other, noncancer eye conditions, related with the oxida-\\ntive stress (OS) induced by UVR exposure.\\nThe aim of this review is an overview of the most recent\\nknowledge on the role of the UVR in eye health and its\\naging process with a main focus on OS-induced noncancer\\ndiseases.

Most prevalent ocular diseases are analyzed in\\nrelation to OS and solar UVR exposure, such as cataract,\\nglaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\\nPossible OS signaling streams and mechanisms related to\\nthe various diseases in the aging eye are discussed.\\n2 | TYPES OF LIGHT-INDUCED DAMAGE\\nTO THE OCULAR TISSUES\\nThree main types of tissue light damage are distinguished\\n[8]: thermal (inflammatory response), photomechanical\\n(stress confinement) and photochemical (photo-oxidation).\\nImportant differences among these photic damages are\\nrelated not only to their damaging mechanism but also to\\ntheir primary absorbers, thresholds and light inducing spec-\\ntrum [8]. One of the main differences between the photo-\\nchemical and the other damages is their light-inducing\\nsources [8]. While thermal and photomechanical damages\\noccur only due to coherent light sources, for example,\\nlasers, photochemical damage may also be produced by\\nexposure to solar radiation. Solar light reaching the eye is\\nessential for visual perception but despite that the eye has\\nseveral UVR protective mechanisms, discussed in detail in\\nsection 3.1, it is easy to expose it to levels that exceed these\\nnatural defense limits. We continue with a brief description\\nof the damaging mechanisms in the thermal and photome-\\nchanical types and discuss in detail the role of UVR in the\\nphotochemical damage, which is thought to be the most\\ncommon mechanism by which light exposure causes cellu-\\nlar damage. An overview of the different types of damage is\\ngiven in Table 1.\\n2.1 | Photothermal damage\\nIn thermal damage, the structure of proteins is corrupted by\\nstrong oscillations that break bonds between molecules [9].\\nFor example, when boiling an egg the protein changes from\\ntransparent to opaque.\\nPhotothermal damage occurs by the transfer of radiant\\nenergy, photons, from light to the retinal tissue. A photon\\ncan be absorbed by a molecule only if its energy is equiva-\\nlent to the energy difference between the molecule's current\\nenergy state and an allowed higher energy level known as\\nan excitation state. For wavelengths of light at the upper\\nend of the visible spectrum, as well as wavelengths of light\\nnear infrared, vibrational and rotational energy states pre-\\ndominate over the excitation states. Therefore, rather than\\nattaining their excitation states, molecules in the tissue tend\\nto gain both rotational and vibrational energy. This increase\\nin mean kinetic energy is dissipated as molecules collide\\nwith each other and their temperature increases. The ability\\nof light to cause an increase in mean kinetic energy is\\ninversely proportional to the wavelength of the light. The\\nrelationship between light and energy is described by the\\nequation:E = hc/λ, where energy (E) equals Planck's con-\\nstant (h) multiplied by the speed of light (c) divided by the\\nwavelength of light (λ). Therefore, the shorter the wave-\\nlength, the greater the potential increase in kinetic energy\\nand the greater the rise in temperature for a fixed exposure\\ntime. In a closed system, there is a proportional relationship\\nbetween exposure time and thermal effect. In an open sys-\\ntem, the amount of energy required to produce a given ther-\\nmal effect increases for longer exposure times as energy in\\nthe form of heat dissipates to the surrounding environment\\nduring the exposure. Therefore, dependent on the duration\\nof thermal exposure, irreversible thermal damage in the ret-\\nina typically occurs after the ambient temperature in the tis-\\nsue is raised by at least 10 /C14C [10]. On cellular and\\nmolecular levels, increase in temperature cause the denatur-\\ning of proteins, loss of molecular tertiary structure and fluid-\\nization of membranes.\\n2.2 | Photomechanical damage\\nPhotodisruption occurs when the laser exposure deposits\\nenergy into the optical zone in a pulse that is shorter than\\nthe relaxation time required to relieve the mechanical\\nstress produced in the tissue by thermoelastic expansion\\n[8]. The local temperature in the optical zone during the\\nlaser exposure may reach up to 10 000/C14C. Tissue damage\\nresults from actual mechanical compressive or tensile\\nforces. Tensile forces resulting in the formation of micro-\\ncavitation bubbles, in particular, are lethal for retinal pig-\\nment epithelium (RPE) and other cells of the retina\\n(Figure 2).\\nTABLE 1 Mechanisms of light damage to the eye\\nMechanism Spectra\\nExposure time\\n(short pulses)\\nTemperature\\nincrease\\nPhotothermal upper end\\nVIS;\\nnear IR\\n/C24100 ms 10 /C14C< ΔT < 100/C14C\\nPhotomechanical near IR /C2410 ns ΔT /C2410 000/C14C\\nPhotochemical linear\\nAblative UVC /C241 μs ΔT <1 0/C14C\\nOxidative UVA and\\nVIS\\nlong /C24s, min ΔT <1 0/C14C\\nPhotosensitized\\nType I and\\ntype II\\nUVA /C24months,\\nyears\\nΔT<1 0/C14C\\nDelayed\\neffects\\nUVA and\\nUVB\\n/C24months,\\nyears\\nΔT<1 0/C14C\\nThe type of tissue light damage (first column) depends on the spectra of the\\nexposing light (second column), the duration of the exposure (third column) and\\nthe type of tissue being exposed, which in turn determines the exposure temper-\\nature (last column).

By definition, it is damage to the\\ntissue that is independent of either mechanical or thermal\\ndamage. Three types of photochemical damage are known:\\nablation, photo-oxidative damage and photosensitized reac-\\ntion. Among them, the last 2 are the most common damages\\nin tissue caused by solar energy and UVR in particular.\\n2.3.1 | Photochemical ablation\\nPhotochemical ablation results when high-energy UVC and\\nUVB photons interact with molecules [12]. At wavelengths\\nbelow 200 nm, photons are sufficiently energetic to break\\nchemical bonds, for example, these photons possess greater\\nthan 6 eV/photon compared to the average covalent bond\\nstrength of 2 to 4 eV. If these UV photons are delivered to\\nthe tissue in short pulses, tissue may be removed precisely.\\nTissue removed through this mechanism is ejected at high\\nvelocities, with little apparent thermal damage to the\\nremaining tissue, although there is continuing concern about\\nthe degree of risk to the remaining tissue from recoil shock\\nproduced by the high-velocity ejection of molecules [12].\\nHowever, photochemical ablation is used extensively in\\nophthalmology for refractive surgery, where the cornea is\\nreshaped to change its refractive power by application of\\nthe ArF excimer laser, which emits light at 193 nm.\\n2.3.2 | Photo-oxidative damage\\nPhoto-oxidative, or commonly referred to as photochemical\\ndamage, occurs when incident light interacts with an endog-\\nenous chromophore in the ocular tissue, causing a chemical\\nchange that is not related to a thermal increase in the irradi-\\nated tissue. Candidates for intraocular chromophores excit-\\nable by UVA and visible wavelengths are photoreceptor\\nvisual pigments, proteins, flavoproteins and the naturally\\noccurring pigment granules of melanin and lipofuscin in the\\nRPE [8, 11]. Photochemical damage is associated with\\nlong-duration exposure, wavelength of 550 nm or shorter\\n(including blue light) and low to moderate tissue irradiance\\n[8, 11]. The short visible wavelengths are also strongly\\nabsorbed by the RPE pigments, melanin and lipofuscin,\\nboth of which are photoexcitable. Photochemical damage is\\ngenerally a linear process: their extent depends on the\\namount of light absorbed in a chromophore. When the chro-\\nmophore absorbs a photon, it is typically excited to a triplet\\nstate. Triplets are reactive species and readily undergo\\nchemical reactions with other molecules.\\nA well known example of photochemical damage is the\\nretinopathy produced by prolonged sungazing. Solar reti-\\nnopathy has been studied in detail and a thermal contribu-\\ntion has been ruled out by an analysis showing that the\\ntemperature increase in the retina during sungazing is at\\nmost only 2 to 4/C14C [13] which is less than the 10/C14C incre-\\nment required for permanent thermal damage [10, 14]. This\\nindicates that a photochemical process is responsible for\\nsolar retinopathy. Retinal damage can also be incurred by\\nprolonged exposure to artificial light sources.\\n2.3.3 | Photosensitized UVR reactions\\nThe previous discussion was primarily concerned with pho-\\ntochemical damage resulting from the direct interaction of\\nlight with endogenous tissue chromophores. In contrast, in\\nthe photosensitization process oxygen and photosensitizers\\nare required to absorb the UVR, although sometimes longer\\nwavelengths can also be involved. Some sensitizers are nat-\\nural compounds but most are synthetic. A photosensitizer\\nmay be defined as a chemical which, on activation by radia-\\ntion, causes another component of a cellular system to react.\\nTwo basic mechanisms for photosensitized reactions have\\nbeen distinguished (Figure 3). It is important to note that\\nthese reactions are significant sources of reactive oxygen\\nspecies (ROS) due to the constant exposure of the eyes to\\nsolar UVR. While it is known that both the UVA and UVB\\ncomponents of the solar radiation are strongly implicated in\\nthe etiology of most skin [16, 17] and eyelid [18] cancers\\nand in the generation of reactive free radicals, [19] their role\\nand contribution to noncancer diseases in the eye is less\\nclear cut [20].\\n3 | UVR TYPE AND REACTIVE OXYGEN\\nSPECIES\\nHere, our focus is on the involvement of the UVA and\\nUVB solar bands in the different photosensitized reactions\\n(Table 2), rather on giving detail description of the complex\\nFIGURE 2 Morphological structure of the\\nretina\\n4o f1 3 IVANOV ET AL.'),\n",

Both type I and type II reactions, presented\\nschematically in Figure 3, are known to be induced by\\nUVA and give rise to carbon-centered radicals, the likely\\nprecursors of peroxyl radicals through subsequent O2 addi-\\ntion. Superoxide radical anion O : −\\n2 is typically the final\\nresult of type I reactions. The toxic O: −\\n2 is highly reactive\\nand may also dismutate biologically to form the electric\\nneutral hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen in a\\nsecondary reaction. The second major photosensitization\\nmechanism is mostly related with energy transfer to molecu-\\nlar oxygen giving rise to singlet oxygen1O2, which is spe-\\ncifically reactive towards biomolecules exhibiting double\\nbonds rich in electrons. Confirmation for the occurrence of\\nthe sensitized reactions to UVA radiation was gained from a\\nnoninvasive detection of1O2 and O: −\\n2 in UVA-exposed skin\\nof mice [22, 23]. This was achieved using a specific and a\\nsensitive chemiluminescence probe and ultra low light\\nimaging device with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)\\ncamera.\\nMore specific information concerning the involvement\\nof the UVB radiation in photosensitized delayed reactions\\nwas gained from real-time chemiluminescence imaging\\nmeasurements with a time-dependent increase within the\\nfew minutes following the end of the irradiation [24, 25]\\nand using noninvasive Fourier-transform Raman spectros-\\ncopy analysis of the epidermis [26]. It is also known that\\nUVB radiation is a more efficient generator of H2O2 than\\nUVC photons [15]. Similarly, it is now known that expo-\\nsure to UVA photons may also lead to the generation of\\nROS as delayed biochemical reaction. Evidence is showing\\nthat UVA-induced inflammation reactions are mediated by\\ninitially generated H2O2 that are likely to initiate signal\\ntransduction processes [27].\\nIt is worth noting that UVA radiation is more efficient\\nthan UVB in inducing oxidatively generated damage to the\\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in isolated cells and skin [19,\\n21]. The UVA-induced damage is mostly explained in terms\\nof selective oxidation by singlet oxygen generated through\\ntype II photosensitization mechanism. However, while both\\nUVB and UVA radiation bands are able to trigger delayed\\noxidative responses that may persist after the irradiation is\\nstopped, there is no evidence for the implication of delayed\\noxidative degradation pathways of cellular DNA.\\nOnce generated, the free radicals (HO..,O : −\\n2 ) that belong\\nto the ROS and the nonradical oxygen species (H2O2, 1O2),\\nbeside DNA, can attack many other molecule types causing\\ndamage and rendering them inactive. Tissues in which there\\nis a large concentration of cell membranes and oxygen are\\nparticularly vulnerable to free radicals; the attack of free\\nradicals on polyunsaturated fatty acids results in lipid perox-\\nidation that breaks down membranous structures. Lipid\\nFIGURE 3 A schematic diagram of ROS generation due to UVR exposure. On the top, type I and II reactions are shown. In type II, a chromophore is\\nexcited by light to a triplet state, and undergoes a direct electron or hydrogen exchange with a substrate, creating a free-radical intermediate. This free radical\\nreacts with additional substrate or with oxygen to create peroxidation reaction products. In the case of lipid peroxidation, the reactions proceed as a self-\\npropagating chain. In the type II photodynamic reaction, there is an energy transfer from the excited chromophore directly to oxygen (O2), creating a\\nreactive singlet oxygen, which is a triplet in its ground state and it is abandon especially in the retina. Singlet oxygen1O2 in turn reacts with lipids to create\\nperoxides without a free-radical intermediate, or it can react with other substrates to generate reactive free radicals. At the bottom, a schematic diagram of a\\ndelayed reaction is shown. It is characterized by the generation of the electric neutral hydrogen peroxide, which can cross through specific cell membranes\\nand appear in other compartments of a cell different from those where it was generated [15].

The proximity to choroidal blood vessels in the\\nouter retina favors photoreceptor cells and RPE cells to be\\nhighly oxygenated and consequently more sensitive to oxy-\\ngen imbalance (Figure 4) and photochemical damage.\\nAlthough, the retina has a system that protects cells and tis-\\nsues against OS, aging or deficient nutritional conditions,\\nthese mechanisms could fail and the pathologic symptom of\\nretinal degeneration begins. There are several layers in and\\noutside the human eye that protect the retina from OS\\ninduced by direct exposure to UVR.\\nOzone is a gas present in the upper layers of the atmo-\\nsphere and serves as the first exogenous protection layer\\nagainst harmful UVR. Its molecules are formed by 3 atoms\\nof oxygen and have the ability to absorb UVR from the sun-\\nlight. The major natural source of ultraviolet radiation is the\\nsun and when solar UVR passes through the atmosphere, it\\nundergoes scattering and absorption. Absorption is mainly\\nin the stratosphere and is mediated by molecular oxygen\\nand ozone. The ozone layers prevent almost all UVC from\\nreaching the eye. They also absorb about 70% to 90% of the\\nUVB. Thinning of the protective ozone layers has led to an\\nincrease in solar UVB radiation reaching the Earth's surface,\\nwith many consequences for human health.\\nAs already outlined in section 1, the absorption spectrum\\nof each ocular tissue determine the effect of light on the ret-\\nina and the manner in which light traverses the ocular media\\nto reach the retina (Figure 1). Beside the upper eye lids and\\nto a lower extent the eyebrows that shield the eye, tear film\\nis the first protective layer of the eye that absorbs UVR.\\nAlthough the eye is designed to focus light specifically on\\nthe central retina, some of the light entering the eye is either\\nabsorbed or scattered by the tissue and media between the\\nfront of the eye and the retina. The 2 most important sources\\nof tissue absorption of UVR are the cornea and the lens. The\\ncornea is transparent to visible light but absorbs a significant\\nportion of the UVB radiation, variously noted as 22% to\\n73% for the 300 to 320 nm band or up to 92%, and a very\\nsmall amount of UVA radiation [28, 29]. The next layer of\\ndefense against UVR is the aqueous humor. Ultraviolet\\nwavelengths from 295 to 317 nm are absorbed in the\\naqueous humor but absorption decreases with increasing\\nwavelength, such that the aqueous humor is transparent to\\nvisible light, that is, there is no absorption of wavelengths\\ngreater than 400 nm. Ascorbic acid in the aqueous humor is\\nbelieved to be responsible for UV absorption and also pro-\\nvides antioxidant protection from UVR-induced damage to\\nthe lens surface. The human lens is cloudless at birth and\\ntransmits both UVA and UVB radiation, allowing these\\nwavelengths to reach the retina, the choroid, and the ciliary\\nbody. As the lens ages, changes in the lens proteins and yel-\\nlowing of the lens decreases transmission of UV wave-\\nlengths, so that tissues beyond the lens are believed to be\\nprotected from UVR in adulthood. Although a considerable\\nproportion of UVR reaching the lens is absorbed (36%\\nabsorbance at 320 nm and 48% absorbance at 340 nm), it is\\nestimated that in adulthood less than 1% of UVR below\\n340 nm and 2% of UVR between 340 and 360 nm reaches\\nthe retina [3, 4]. The lens is also rich in antioxidants, peroxi-\\ndase and vitamin C. Transmission through the vitreous\\nhumor, comprised of approximately 98% water, increases\\nwith increasing wavelength, to approximately 80% at\\nFIGURE 4 Top, equilibrium between reactive oxygen species production\\nand antioxidant defense mechanism.

It is well established that UVA is directly\\ninducing oxidatively generated damage to the DNA and\\nother molecules in the cells [19]. In the following, we\\nmainly focus on the recently discovered dual role of UVA-\\nand UVB-induced hydrogen peroxide [19] in intercellular\\nmembrane transport and OS of biological systems.\\n4 | T H ER O L EO FH Y D R O G E NP E R O X I D E\\nAS SIGNALING MOLECULE IN THE EYE\\nOn one side, ROS and H2O2 have long been known with\\ntheir potential to damage proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.\\nOn the other side, more recently the picture of H2O2 as a\\nthreat to cellular homeostasis has changed towards seeing it\\nas a signaling molecule controlling different essential pro-\\ncesses in plants and mammals [30, 31]. Therefore, hydrogen\\nperoxide appears to be both potentially toxic and a central\\nsignaling compound. While it is shown that free diffusion\\nof H2O2 across membranes is limited, there are evidences\\nthat selected aquaporin homologs have the capacity to chan-\\nnel it across membranes. Aquaporins (Figure 5) are selec-\\ntive channels in the cell membrane and mainly facilitate the\\ntransport of water in response to osmotic gradients [32, 33].\\nThe first evidence about H 2O2-mediated intercellular\\nsignaling was striking. In one study [34], it was demon-\\nstrated that hydrogen peroxide produced by human epider-\\nmal keratinocytes regulates melanogenesis of neighboring\\nmelonocytes and contributes to the progression of lesions.\\nIn another study [35], H 2O2 secretion of myofibroblasts\\ninduced cell death in adjacent lung epithelial cells. In both\\nstudies [34, 35], coculture systems were used to demon-\\nstrate that H2O2, produced from one cell type, was per-\\nceived as a signal in the other cell type, though both cell\\ntypes were physically separated via a transwell system.\\nThe existence of aquaporin-9 (AQP-9) in various struc-\\ntures of the human eye is important, as this aquaporin is\\ncapable of transporting molecules other than water, hydro-\\ngen peroxide in particular. AQP-9 has been localized to spe-\\ncific and important regulatory sites within the human eye\\nwhere the transport of both water and other solutes with\\nmetabolic properties occurs. In a study using immunofluo-\\nrescence technique [36], it was investigated the expression\\nof the more recently discovered AQPs 6-12 in the human\\neye. AQP-9 was detected in the choroid, ciliary body,\\ncorneo-limbal tissue, retina and sclera. The AQP-9 facili-\\ntated membrane transport of hydrogen peroxide in mice and\\nhuman cells was also recently demonstrated by Watanabe\\net al. [37].\\nThese findings highlight ways of H2O2 generation and\\ntransport substrate in different layers of the human eye and\\nshow that OS is not confound only to tissues directly\\nexposed to the harmful UVR. Therefore, high concentration\\nlevels of H2O2 in an exposed eye tissue are likely via aqua-\\nporin water channels to increase OS levels in surrounding\\ntissues where H2O2 concentration is lower. The H2O2 con-\\ncentration in the eye usually range from 30 to 70μmol/L\\nwith high concentration of UVR-induced oxidant occurring\\nin the anterior uvea and aqueous humor. It is therefore plau-\\nsible that H2O2, due to its ability to diffuse in aqueous\\nmedium across cell membranes, to produce harmful HO..\\nradicals, which imbalance retinal ROS and contribute con-\\nsiderably to the epithelial cell death. Additionally, through-\\nout the life chronic exposure of the retina to varying low\\nlevels of both UVA and UVB radiation [3, 4] also contrib-\\nutes to the accumulation of OS. We will conclude this paper\\nby discussing ocular pathologies known to be related with\\nincreased OS and thus influenced by prolonged eye expo-\\nsure to harmful solar UVA and UVB radiation.\\n5 | NONCANCER OCULAR PATHOLOGIES\\nThere is growing evidence and general agreement for the\\nOS theory of aging.

The most frequently\\nreported criteria for the involvement of OS in the ocular dis-\\neases pathology include the increased levels of biomarkers\\nof oxidative damage of DNA, proteins and lipids, as well as\\ndecreased antioxidant levels. These criteria are fulfilled in\\nseveral ocular pathologies (Table 3) among which, AMD,\\nglaucoma and cataract are the main cause of blindness in\\nthe world. Since the cornea absorbs approximately 80% of\\nthe incident UVB radiation, it is especially prone to OS and\\nhence several corneal conditions are also discussed.\\n5.1 | Age-related macular degeneration\\nThe pathogenesis of AMD, which is the main cause of\\nblindness in the adult population of the developed countries,\\nis complex and multifactorial, involving various genetic loci\\nand environmental factors. There is considerable evidence\\nin the literature that the OS is an important factor in the dis-\\nease process [38, 39]. For instance, a recent study [38] on a\\nlarge cohort of participants evaluated the effects of current\\nand past sunlight exposure, as well as the iris color on early\\nand late AMD. They investigated the amount of self-\\nreported sun exposure the participants had in their past and\\nmore currently. It was found that past and prolonged sun-\\nlight exposure was significantly associated with early and\\nlate AMD development. It was concluded that sunlight-\\ninduced OS is an important risk factor for AMD, but in the\\nstudy was not investigated whether its effect on the retina\\nwas due to UVR or short-wavelength blue light.\\nThere are direct evidences supporting the involvement\\nof OS in the development of changes and death in RPE\\ncells: for instance, exposure of RPE to H2O2 leads to dam-\\nage and death of these cells [40, 41]. Indirect evidence for\\nthe role of UVR-induced OS in AMD comes from a histo-\\nlogical cross-sectional study [42]. Loeffler et al. [42] exam-\\nined the association between AMD and other ocular\\nchanges possibly induced by UVR: pinguecula and scleral\\nplaque. What they found was a significant association\\nbetween scleral plaque and AMD. This finding provides in\\nturn support for a causative role of exposure to solar radia-\\ntion in the development of AMD, given that solar radiation\\nhas a causative role in the development of scleral plaque.\\nSimilarly, Klein et al. [43] found that cataract was associ-\\nated with incidence of early AMD and progression of\\nAMD. Therefore, the role of both UVA and UVB radiation\\nin the development of AMD should be seriously considered\\nand proper prevention throughout the life against harmful\\nUVR must not be underestimated.\\nThere is currently a scientific debate on the effect of\\nblue light on the development of eye conditions such as\\nAMD and there is a evidence that the use of digital devices\\nthat emit visible blue light may impact sleep [44]. In an\\nin vitro study [45], the response of RPE cells to a non-\\nlethal dose of blue light was evaluated. In a model system,\\nblue light irradiation of RPE cells induced mild stress\\nwithout causing cell death. This effect that otherwise do\\nnot affect cell viability is consistent with the early stages\\nof AMD where widespread RPE cell death is not generally\\nseen. In another study [46], the hypothesis that there is a\\nlink between blue light oxidation-induced events and the\\nonset of AMD was demonstrated in mice exposed to blue\\nlight.\\n5.2 | Glaucoma\\nGlaucoma is the second most relevant cause of blindness\\nworldwide. The disease is a progressive optic neuropathy,\\noften caused by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) conse-\\nquent to abnormal high resistance to aqueous humor drain-\\nage via the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal [47].\\nRegulation of IOP depends on the balance of complex\\nmechanisms involved in the production and outflow of\\naqueous humor, including the stability and survival of cellu-\\nlar phenotypes responsible for correct maintenance of\\nhomeostasis [48]. The most frequent glaucoma type is the\\nchronic clinical manifestation known as the primary\\nopen-angle glaucoma (POAG) [47]. In spite of elevated\\nIOP, apoptosis has been recognized as the end point for reti-\\nnal ganglion cells (RGC) in any glaucoma type [48]. Oxida-\\ntive UVA and UVB damage was found in the DNA of\\nPOAG patients [49]. Moreover, a significant correlation\\nbetween oxidative DNA damage and IOP was described in\\nglaucomatous patients. It was shown that POAG patients\\ndisplay a genetic background rendering them susceptible to\\nROS-induced damage because of a more frequent deletion\\nof specific genes pivotal for the antioxidant defense (AOX)\\nTABLE 3 OS-related noncancer ocular pathologies of the eye and the\\naffected tissues, respectively\\nDisease Targeted tissues\\nGlaucoma Trabecular meshwork\\nAMD Retinal pigmented epithelial cells;\\nchoroid\\nCataract Lens\\nDry eye syndrome Tear film; ocular surface\\nPterygium Cornea\\nFuch's endothelial corneal\\ndystrophy\\nCornea\\nKeratoconus Cornea\\nDiseases that are among the main causes of blindness in the world are\\nhighlighted in bold.\\n8o f1 3 IVANOV ET AL.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\eyeHealth.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='mechanism (Figure 4). OS has also been linked to POAG\\nby increasing flow resistance in the aqueous humor of the\\neye in the presence of high levels of hydrogen peroxide.\\nThese reports implicate that OS is a critical factor involved\\nin RGCs apoptosis in glaucomatous patients [50]. While,\\nRGC loss in glaucoma is still a mystery to scientists, the\\ncontribution of OS is unequivocal and therefore chronic\\nexposure of the eye to UVR in daily life must be\\nminimized.\\n5.3 | Cataract\\nIt is a commonly considered hypothesis that OS is a key\\nfactor in the development of cataract, the most common\\ncause of blindness in the world [51, 52]. The disease is\\ncharacterized by damage of crystalline proteins, nucleic\\nacids, lipids and polysaccharides with consequent opacity of\\nthe eye lens [53, 54]. The main factors leading to cataract\\nare UVR-induced ROS formation and reduction in the activ-\\nity of an enzyme family that catalyzes the reductase of\\nhydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, as well as catalyz-\\ning the reduction of peroxide radicals to alcohols and oxy-\\ngen. It has been observed that the concentration of H2O2 in\\naqueous humor is strongly increased when this oxidant con-\\ncentration is high in the lens. The role of H2O2 in cataract\\ndevelopment also found a confirmation in the reduction of\\nthe defense enzymes activities and antioxidant reductase in\\nthe lens of patients with cataract. Importantly, an increased\\nconcentration of lipid peroxidation products in aqueous\\nhumor of age-related cataract has been observed. It was\\ndemonstrated that an accumulation of products of the lens\\noxidation, the decreasing potential of antioxidants with age\\nand weaker repair mechanisms are relevant to the develop-\\nment of age-related cataract.\\n5.4 | Dry eye syndrome\\nDry eye is defined as a multifactorial disease of the tears\\nand the ocular surface that is characterized by symptoms of\\ndiscomfort, visual disturbance and tear-film instability that\\nmay cause potential damage to the ocular surface [55]. OS\\ncan be involved in dry eye disease or keratoconjuctivitis\\nsicca, a high impact ocular pathology that affects 20% to\\n30% of the population worldwide [56–58]. Although the\\ndetailed mechanisms operating in this disease have not been\\nfully elucidated, the body of evidence available from basic\\nand clinical research [56, 57] indicates that inflammation\\nand ocular surface immunology play a key role in the initia-\\ntion and development of dry eye disease. The tear-film layer\\nis responsible for the homeostasis of the ocular surface and\\nantioxidant protection against OS. In dry eye syndrome, the\\nexpression of various antioxidant enzymes is significantly\\nlower as compared to healthy controls [59]. OS is highly\\ninvolved in the disruption in the homeostasis, which causes\\na disorder in the integrity of the ocular surface and damage\\nin extracellular DNA [58, 60]. Thus, the inflammatory reac-\\ntions are initiated and become the key mechanism in dry\\neye syndrome and ocular surface injury. These tear-film\\nalternations and their effects on the ocular surface result in\\nreduced visual quality and in rear cases may lead to visual\\nimpairment. The ocular surface inflammation and dry eye\\nsyndrome are frequently seen in pterygium patients [61].\\n5.5 | Pterygium\\nThe corneal epithelium acts as a UV filter to protect internal\\neye structures through absorption of UVB rays as well as\\nthrough fluorescence-mediated ray transformation and\\nreduction [62]. Key role in these processes involves the\\nhigh ascorbate concentration in the corneal epithelium [62].\\nUVB radiation modulates expressions of antioxidants and\\npro-inflammatory mediators by corneal epithelium cells\\n[63]. Alternations in the expression of these important pro-\\ntecting mediators, by UVR-induced OS, may result in pte-\\nrygium [64]. Thus, pterygium is inflammatory and\\ndegenerative ocular surface disease attributed to chronic\\nUVB exposure. Clinically, the condition involves invasive\\ncentripetal growth with associated inflammation and neo-\\nvascularization [49, 65]. When it extends to the central opti-\\ncal zone, visual function can be severely impaired [49, 65].\\nWhile genetic components may also be involved in patho-\\ngenesis of pterygium, chronic exposure to UVB is the deter-\\nmining factor in promoting the development of pterygium\\n[65]. For instance, the prevalence of pterygium is high and\\nis a significant health issue in Australia and surrounding ter-\\nritories [66], where extreme levels of solar UVR exposure\\nmay be reached in outdoors. Conjunctival ultraviolet auto-\\nfluorescence is a biomarker of ocular sun exposure and can\\nbe associated with increased time spent outdoors [66].\\nIncreased prevalence of pterygium is associated with\\nincreased time spent outdoors and autofluorescence [66],\\nwhich in turn suggests a relation between UVR exposure,\\ninduced OS and development of pterygium. Further evi-\\ndence for the involvement of UVR in pterygium pathogene-\\nsis comes from the finding that it is usually found at sites in\\nthe eye where peripheral light is focused by the anterior eye\\n[61]. By using computer simulations of ray— tracing, it was\\ndemonstrated the pathways by which the anterior eye, acting\\nas a side— on lens focuses light onto the opposite side of\\nthe eye, to the nasal limbus [61]. In particular, light rays\\nproceed across the anterior eye by traversing the aqueous\\nhumor in the anterior chamber and the degree of limbal\\nfocusing is determined in part by the corneal shape and\\nanterior chamber depth. The peak light intensity at the distal\\nlimbus is approximately 20 times that of the incident light\\nintensity and the light focus is not a spot but rather a com-\\nplex arc shape [61], which coincides with the typical shape\\nof the bulbar conjuctiva that grows on the ocular surface in\\npterygium.\\nIVANOV ET AL. 9o f1 3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\eyeHealth.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=\"5.6 | Keratoconus\\nAlthough keratoconus (KCN) is not among the main dis-\\neases that may cause blindness in the world, it is important\\nfrom a clinical and epidemiological aspect. In a recent\\nnationwide registration study [67] on more than 4 million\\npatients from a mandatory insurance database in the Nether-\\nlands, the prevalence and incidence of KCN were estimated\\nto be 5- to 10-fold higher than previously reported. The\\nprevalence, the number of given cases at a given time point,\\nthat is cited most often is 1:2000 [68], while the newly esti-\\nmated was 1:375 [67]. The big difference between the 2 esti-\\nmations may be accounted for by the advent of new\\nimaging techniques, leading to more sensitive diagnosis\\n[67]. KCN is a progressive corneal disease, characterized\\nwith corneal protrusion and thinning, which result in irregu-\\nlar astigmatism that may lead to decrease in vision: the thin-\\nning results in shape alternations and ultimately the cornea\\nassumes conical shape. Although in most cases the loss in\\nvisual acuity can be restored through the use of glasses or\\ncontact lenses, complex corneal transplantations are indi-\\ncated in approximately 10% to 20% of KCN patients\\n[67, 69].\\nWhile KCN is a multifactorial disease with several bio-\\nchemical processes contributing to its development, OS\\nplays a critical role in both its development and progression\\n[70, 71]. OS involvement in KCN is indicated by the accu-\\nmulation of cytotoxic byproducts and mitochondrial DNA\\ndamage [70, 71]. OS is induced in response to direct cornea\\nexposure to UVA and UVB radiation that leads to decrease\\nin keratocyte density, a reduction in the number of lamellae,\\nand a degradation of fibroblasts in the stroma. In addition,\\nchanges occur in the gross organization of the lamellae, and\\nan uneven distribution of collagen fibrillar mass, especially\\naround the apex of the cone is observed. OS also causes\\nfailure of catalyzes [72] that reduces the lipid hydroperox-\\nides to water and alcohol, and H2O2 to water and O2. KNC\\ncorneas exhibit higher levels of mitochondrial DNA damage\\nand increased number of mitochondrial DNA rearrange-\\nments, deletions and mutations [71, 73]. Mitochondrial\\nDNA is more prone to damage, as it has a less efficient\\nrepair system than nuclear DNA. Thus, mitochondrial dam-\\nage induces an increase in OS and may alter gene expres-\\nsion, induce apoptosis and loss of cell viability [71, 73].\\n5.7 | Fuch's dystrophy\\nIn a healthy cornea, endothelial cells keep the tissue from\\nexcess fluid absorption, pumping it back into the aqueous\\nhumor. When oxidative damage occurs, the premature cor-\\nneal endothelial cell loss is permanent and if cell number is\\ntoo low, the fluid absorption pump starts to fail [49]. This\\ncauses the fluid to move anterior into the epithelium, which\\nin turn leads to swelling of the cornea. As fluid accumulates\\nbetween the basal epithelium cells, blisters form and they\\nmay undergo painful ruptures releasing their fluid content to\\nthe surface. Changes in Descemet membrane, a layer adja-\\ncent to the corneal endothelium, coincide with primary fail-\\nure of the endothelial cells and are integral component of\\nthe process of loss of corneal endothelial function [74].\\nThese characteristic malformations produce corneal cloud-\\ning that disrupts vision and creates pain sensations: this con-\\ndition is known as Fuch's endothelial corneal dystrophy [49,\\n74]. Decreased ability to resist OS in the corneal endothe-\\nlium is known to play a key role in alternation of gene\\nexpressions in the antioxidant response element mitochon-\\ndrial DNA damage [49, 75, 76]. In Fuch's dystrophy, the\\npremature endothelial cell loss, due to their decreased ability\\nto resist OS and increased susceptibility to apoptosis [74], is\\nassociated with pathways throughout the corneal\\nlayers [74].\\n6 | UVR PROTECTION HIGHLIGHTS\\nIn the end, we want to highlight that the invisible thread\\ncaused by solar UVA and UVB radiation to the human eye\\nshould not be underestimated. Unfortunately, some ophthal-\\nmic lens standards still ignore this invisible hazard of UVR\\nwavelengths, especially the ones longer than 380 nm, thus\\ncreating an UVR protection void. However, UVR between\\n380 and 400 nm is abundant in the solar UVR spectrum\\n[77], and UVR hazard from these wavelengths have been\\nreported in numerous recent works [78–82]. Therefore, we\\nadopted the most widely used definition of UVR extending\\nup to 400 nm, first described by the ICNIRP [2]. The\\nICNIRP document is a guideline to evaluate specific expo-\\nsure levels by measuring the expected amount of UVR\\nexposure and determining whether an individual might be\\nexposed to a daily dose that exceeds permissible levels. This\\nadoption is in line with the recommendations adopted by\\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) [83], while other\\norganizations like the American National Standards Institute\\n[84] still keep the 380 nm limit. The adoption of UVR limit\\nis important since in a study by Latimer et al. [78] it was\\nshown that when the ICNIRP-UVR action spectrum was\\nweighted by the solar UVR spectrum adopted in ISO 8980-\\n3 [77], where the 380 nm limit is also considered, the\\nresults (Figure 6) suggested that a much larger threat exists\\nfrom the wavelengths ignored by the ISO and ANSI stan-\\ndards. The adoption of a proper UVR definition seems to be\\ncritical, considering the fact that most nonglass spectacle\\nlens materials possess high transmittance in the UVA band\\nof wavelengths above 350 nm.\\nThere are reliable evidences that excessive exposure to\\nUVR through live, especially until teenager age, may seri-\\nously contribute to increase in OS of various eye tissues and\\nthus lead to the advancement of serious ocular pathologies,\\nsuch as AMD, glaucoma and cataract later in life. Children\\nare especially vulnerable to UVR because of their larger\\n10 of 13 IVANOV ET AL.\"),\n",

WHO has esti-\\nmated that up to 80% of a person's lifetime exposure to UVR\\nis reached before the age of 18. A study [85] using fluores-\\ncence photography has demonstrated this point and showed\\nexamples of early UVR damage to young eyes that are not\\nvisible under normal light viewing, for example, direct oph-\\nthalmoscopy. We also want to stress that exposure to UVR\\nhas a cumulative effect over lifetime. Considering that the life\\nexpectancy is rising, this increases the chance for the accu-\\nmulated effect in the tissues to develop and result in age-\\nrelated pathologies. It is clear that provision and sustained\\nUVR protection from a young age is extremely important.\\nTherefore, options for solar protection, including sun-\\nglasses, clear spectacles or contact lenses, wide brim hats,\\nabsorbing films for side windows in cars [86], blocking UV\\nbelow 400 nm should be seriously considered. To that end,\\nseveral initiatives have already been started. For instance, in\\nAustralia sunglass standards are the common UV protection\\nbench mark, where light below 400 nm is defined as harmful\\n[87] and is blocked by the lenses. WHO has presented infor-\\nmation to form a knowledge base for the prevention of\\nadverse effects of UV exposure that is achievable with\\nknown and accessible interventions. They acknowledge the\\nglobal burden of disease from solar ultraviolet radiation and\\nthe special care needed to protect kids from the harm associ-\\nated with overexposure of the eye to UVR. In addition, the\\nEuropean Medicine Agency has adopted a Guidance on\\nphotosafety evaluation of pharmaceuticals, since certain UV-\\nexcited drugs, like antibiotics, antidepressants and topically\\napplied anti-inflammatories may represent a likely phototoxic\\nrisk to the retina, lens and other structures in the eye.\\n7 | DIGITAL AGE AND EYE HEALTH\\nLow energy lighting and the extensive use of computer\\nand mobile devices in modern society expose our eyes to\\never-increasing light emissions containing blue light. Con-\\nsequently, the question of whether radiation emitted by\\nthese digital devices may cause eye damage is frequently\\ncirculated in the media and raises concerns in the public.\\nIn a recent study comparing natural exposures with the\\nreasonably estimated exposure to optical radiation from\\nlow-energy lighting, computer screens and mobile\\ndevices, it was shown that the actual spectrally weighted\\nirradiance is lower than the natural exposures [88]. In the\\nICNIRP guidelines light radiation levels below which\\nadverse health effects are unlikely are calculated. To\\nassess an exposure condition from the different devices\\ninvestigated, the spectrum of light at a specific location\\nwas measured and the value at each wavelength was\\nweighted by a relevant factor at that wavelength. Finally,\\nthe weighted values were summed to give the irradiance\\nfor comparison with the guideline exposure limit. It was\\nfound that under even extreme long-term viewing condi-\\ntions, none of the assessed sources exceeded the guideline\\nlimits and therefore extensive exposure to digital device-\\nemitted radiation should not raise concerns for public eye\\nhealth [88]. However, these devices are known to emit\\nstrongly in the short-wavelength part of the visible spec-\\ntrum and blue light is currently considered to have the\\nstrongest effect in synchronizing human circadian rhythm\\n[89, 90]. In the long run, exposure to even low-level blue\\nlight during night or before bed time may disrupt the cir-\\ncadian rhythm with severe general health implications.\\nTherefore, if use of digital devices in the evenings can\\nnot be avoided, their detrimental effect on the circadian\\nrhythm can be reduced, for instance, by wearing blue\\nlight blocking glasses.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nFunding was received from University of Tuebingen (ZUK\\n63) as part of the German Excellence initiative from the\\nFIGURE 6 Application of the results of Latimer et al. [78] suggests that long wavelength UVR (horizontal axis) may be much more harmful than expected\\nwhen ICNIRP-UVR action spectrum is weighted① by the solar UVR spectrum adopted in ISO 8980-3 (vertical axis). Wavelengths between 380 and\\n400 nm were equally as damaging as wavelengths between 350 and 380 nm. Because of the greater penetration of long wavelengths, the region between\\n380 and 400 nm (shaded area④) may actually be more hazardous to skin: deep fibroblasts③ are more susceptible to damage than shallow keratinocytes②\\nIVANOV ET AL. 11 of 13\"),\n",

YANCEY, MD, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, Fort Belvoir, Virginia\\nSARAH M. THOMAS, MD, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington\\n C\\nhronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a \\nwidespread problem. It is estimated \\nthat more than 2 million Ameri -\\ncans have CFS, many of whom have \\nnot been diagnosed.1 Women are twice as likely \\nas men to have CFS,1 and it is more common \\nin persons older than 40 years.1,2 There is not \\nan established racial or educational predilec -\\ntion.1,2 CFS is often mentally and emotionally \\ndebilitating, and persons with this diagnosis \\nare twice as likely to be unemployed as persons \\nwith fatigue who do not meet formal criteria \\nfor CFS.3 In 2002, the estimated annual cost \\nof lost productivity was $9.1 billion dollars in \\nthe United States. 4 In addition to economic \\nhardships, persons with CFS are more likely to \\nreport subjective functional impairment than \\nthose with chronic fatigue.3\\nDiagnosis\\nCFS is a clinical diagnosis that can be made \\nonly when other etiologies of fatigue have \\nbeen excluded. Specific diagnostic criteria \\nfor CFS were developed by the Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) in \\n1988.5 During this time, it was theorized \\nthat viral illness was the primary etiology \\nof CFS; therefore, the criteria focused on \\nphysical symptoms. To parallel the World \\nHealth Organization categorization of CFS \\nas a neurologic disorder, the Oxford criteria \\nwere developed in 1991 (Table 1).6 These cri-\\nteria emphasize mental fatigue over physical \\nsymptoms.6 The CDC’s criteria were revised \\nin 1994 to broaden the definition, and at this \\nChronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by debilitating fatigue that is not relieved with rest and is associated with \\nphysical symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome include \\nsevere fatigue lasting longer than six months, as well as presence of at least four of the following physical symptoms: \\npostexertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; impaired memory or concentration; muscle pain; polyarthralgia; sore \\nthroat; tender lymph nodes; or new headaches. It is a clinical diagnosis that can be made only when other disease \\nprocesses are excluded. The etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is unclear, is likely complex, and may involve dys -\\nfunction of the immune or adrenal systems, an association with certain genetic markers, or a history of childhood \\ntrauma. Persons with chronic fatigue syndrome should be evaluated for concurrent depression, pain, and sleep dis -\\nturbances. Treatment options include cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise therapy, both of which have \\nbeen shown to moderately improve fatigue levels, work and social adjustment, anxiety, and postexertional malaise. No \\npharmacologic or alternative medicine therapies have been proven effective.

These complex fac -\\ntors, along with the numerous psychiatric \\ncomorbidities of CFS, have led some experts \\nto question whether any organic etiology \\nexists. Current research on CFS focuses on \\nthe immune and adrenal systems, genetics, \\nthe biopsychosocial model, and sleep and \\nnutrition.\\nIMMUNE SYSTEM\\nBecause many symptoms of viral infections \\nand CFS overlap, some physicians have theo-\\nrized that CFS has a postinfectious etiology. \\nOne popular theory is that CFS is caused by \\nchronic Epstein-Barr virus infection; how -\\never, there is only mixed evidence of any asso-\\nciation between specific viruses and CFS.10\\nGENETICS\\nIncreasing evidence points to areas of genetic \\nsusceptibility in patients with CFS. One study \\nfound a difference in the expression of cer -\\ntain genes in patients with CFS after exercise \\nthat play a role in metabolism and immune \\nresponses.11 Another study has shown an \\nassociation between specific genetic muta -\\ntions, CFS, and certain viral infections that \\nhave been linked to CFS.12\\nBIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL\\nCFS is often associated with depression, which \\nhas led many physicians to believe that CFS is \\na purely somatic illness. Evidence supporting \\nthis conclusion is lacking. Strong evidence \\nsuggests that childhood trauma increases \\nthe risk of CFS by as much as sixfold. Some \\npersons may assume that childhood trauma \\ndecreases resiliency, but there is evidence to \\nsuggest that it may also play an organic role by \\nincreasing the risk of adrenal system dysfunc-\\ntion.13 It is important to note that social sup -\\nport systems for persons with CFS tend to be \\nless reliable than for those who are healthy. 14 \\nTreatment for CFS is less likely to succeed in \\npersons with poor social adjustment.15\\nADRENAL SYSTEM\\nHypocortisolism has been noted in persons \\nwith CFS; one study found cortisol levels in \\npatients with CFS were about 5 mcg per dL \\n(137.94 nmol per L) less than the levels in \\npatients without CFS.16 This is likely second -\\nary to impaired adrenal cortex responsiveness \\nto adrenocorticotropic hormones and not \\nto hypothalamopituitary dysfunction. 17 It is \\nunclear if such dysfunction is caused by infec-\\ntion, genetics, childhood trauma, unknown \\nfactors, or some combination of these.\\nSLEEP AND NUTRITION\\nThere is an association between delayed \\ndim light melatonin onset and CFS, sug -\\ngesting that delayed circadian rhythm could \\ncontribute to CFS. 18 Although melatonin is \\navailable over the counter for delayed dim \\nlight melatonin onset in the United States, \\nthere is no evidence for improvement in CFS \\nwith melatonin.18,19  \\nOne study has shown that persons with \\nCFS have lower ratios of omega-3 to omega-6 \\nunsaturated fatty acids and lower zinc levels \\nthan healthy patients. 20 However, studies of \\nnutritional supplementation in those with \\nCFS have shown no benefit.21\\nTreatment\\nFamily physicians should focus initially \\non management of symptoms that are \\noften comorbid with CFS, including sleep \\ndisturbances, depression, and pain.

Although there is no evi -\\ndence these modalities are effective, they are \\nunlikely to be harmful and may be helpful. 8\\nThere is substantial evidence for two treat-\\nments for CFS: cognitive behavior therapy \\n(CBT) and graded exercise therapy. There \\nis less clear evidence regarding the benefit \\nof drug therapy for CFS in patients without \\ncomorbid depression or anxiety disorders.\\nCOGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY \\nTrained psychotherapists providing CBT \\nemphasize the role of thinking and its \\nimpact on how persons feel and act. They \\ncan help persons with CFS recognize how \\ntheir fears of activity lead to \\nbehaviors that ultimately cause \\nthem to feel more fatigued \\nand disabled. A large random -\\nized controlled trial in adults \\nwith CFS confirmed that CBT \\nhas positive effects on fatigue \\nlevels, work and social adjust -\\nment, depression, anxiety, and \\npostexertional malaise. Most patients in this \\nstudy rated themselves as “much” or “very \\nmuch” better after completion. 22 \\nA 2008 Cochrane review also supported the \\nuse of CBT for CFS. 23 Several other studies \\nhave shown similar results, 24,25 including in \\nadolescents with CFS.26 One study found fewer \\nschool absences and improvements in fatigue \\nand overall physical functioning in adoles -\\ncents being treated with Internet-based CBT.27 \\nCBT has been studied in group settings28 and \\nin the form of self-guided instruction, 29 with \\nquestionable effectiveness. Because of this, it \\nis recommended that CBT be individualized \\nto maximize benefit. 8 Disadvantages of CBT \\ninclude the need for expert consultation, time \\nconsiderations, and cost. There are no data to \\nsuggest that CBT provided by trained family \\nphysicians is better or worse than CBT pro -\\nvided by psychotherapists.\\nEXERCISE\\nGraded exercise therapy involves a gradual \\nincrease in physical activity in the hopes \\nof increasing function. A randomized trial \\nfound that graded exercise therapy was as \\neffective as CBT for fatigue and the other \\naspects of functional impairment mentioned \\npreviously, except depression. 22 Participants \\nin this trial were encouraged to gradually \\nincrease the duration of their physical activity \\nover 52 weeks to a final goal of 30 minutes of \\nlight exercise five days per week, taking cau -\\ntion not to exceed a target heart rate to avoid \\noverexertion. Most patients chose to walk \\nfor exercise. Once this goal was achieved, the \\npatients worked with the supervising physio-\\ntherapists monthly to increase the intensity \\nof their aerobic exercise. \\nSeveral other studies have found consis -\\ntent results. 30-32 There is some evidence that \\nthe benefits of graded exercise therapy do not \\ncorrelate with increases in exercise capacity, \\nsuggesting that the benefits of graded exer -\\ncise therapy, like CBT, have more to do with \\ndecreasing symptom-focusing behavior in \\npersons with CFS. 33 Impediments to graded \\nexercise therapy include time considerations \\nand concerns from patients that exercise will \\nexacerbate their condition. \\nOTHER NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS\\nOne study has shown that an educational \\nintervention known as pragmatic rehabili -\\ntation provided by specially trained nurses \\nimproves fatigue in persons with CFS; \\nhowever, the improvement did not persist \\nafter 70 weeks. The intervention included \\neducation about CFS, followed by a negoti -\\nated treatment plan of gradually increased \\nactivity.34 Although pragmatic rehabilita -\\ntion is appealing because it avoids the need \\nfor expert consultation, more evidence is \\nneeded to determine if its effectiveness can \\nbe sustained.\\nDespite the positive results with CBT and \\ngraded exercise therapy, the effects are usu -\\nally moderate and rarely lead to resolution of \\nCFS. Patients with poor social adjustment, a \\nstrong belief in an organic cause for fatigue, \\nor some sort of sickness benefit (i.e., financial  \\nincentive) tend to have worse responses to \\ntherapy.15,35 Unlike with many other ill -\\nnesses, membership in a CFS support group \\nwas associated with worse outcomes. 35 \\nThe cause of chronic \\nfatigue syndrome is poorly \\nunderstood, and is likely \\nto be multifactorial and to \\ninvolve genetics and the \\nimmune system.

The EDX findings and impression can then help guide po-\\ntential treatment options for the patient with foot pain and other symptoms. Moreover,\\nthis discussion demonstrates the added value that EDX evaluation of the foot provides\\nto the comprehensive assessment of foot pain.\\nANATOMY\\nFibular (Peroneal) Nerve\\nThe common fibular nerve (CFN, also known as the common peroneal nerve) branches\\nfrom the sciatic nerve proximal to the knee and descends in the posterolateral knee\\nand around the fibular head, where it then divides into the superficial fibular nerve\\n(SFN) and the deep fibular nerve (DFN). Both branches contain fibers originating\\nfrom the L5 and S1 nerve roots.\\nThe SFN innervates the fibularis longus and brevis in the lateral compartment of the\\nleg and then enters the foot at the anterolateral ankle (superficial to the inferior\\nextensor retinaculum) and supplies cutaneous innervation to the dorsal ankle and\\nfoot. In approximately 28% of cases, the SFN supplies an accessory branch of the\\nDFN that travels posterior to the lateral malleolus and then innervates the extensor dig-\\nitorum brevis (EDB).1\\nThe DFN courses through the anterior compartment of the leg (where it supplies mo-\\ntor innervation) before dividing into medial and lateral branches just proximal to the\\nankle. Both branches then pass deep to the inferior extensor retinaculum (sometimes\\nreferred to as the anterior tarsal tunnel).2 The lateral branch provides motor innervation\\nto the EDB. The medial branch supplies cutaneous innervation to the first dorsal web\\nspace. In 92.1% of cases, the medial branch also supplies some motor innervation to\\nthe first dorsal interosseous pedis (DIP), with significantly less innervation to the sec-\\nond and third dorsal interossei.3\\nTibial Nerve\\nThe tibial nerve (TN), carrying fibers from the S1 and S2 nerve roots, enters the foot pos-\\nterior to the medial malleolus deep to the overlying flexor retinaculum within the tarsal\\ntunnel. In the upper, or proximal, tarsal tunnel there is a distinct compartment for the\\nTN, which is a potential site of entrapment.3 The TN has 4 terminal branches: the medial\\nplantar nerve (MPN), lateral plantar nerve (LPN), first branch of the LPN (also referred to\\nas inferior calcaneal nerve or Baxter’s nerve), and the medial calcaneal nerve4 (Fig. 1).\\nFig. 1.

It is typically a purely sensory nerve and supplies\\nsensation to the medial, posterior, and plantar heel.5\\nIn 93% to 95% of cases, the TN divides into the MPN and LPN within the\\ntarsal tunnel. The lower, or distal, tarsal tunnel is divided into upper and lower\\ncalcaneal chambers, which are separated by the interfascicular septum. The\\nMPN travels within the upper chamber, whereas the lower chamber contains the\\nLPN. Both chambers can be a site of possible entrapment for its specific plantar\\nbranch.3\\nAfter exiting the upper calcaneal chamber, the MPN travels through the abductor\\ncanal, a known entrapment site of the MPN, into the medial sole of the foot. The\\nMPN innervates the abductor hallucis (AH), medial and lateral heads of the flexor hal-\\nlucis brevis, flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), and the first lumbrical. It provides sensation\\nto the medial sole of the foot, the plantar surface of the first to third toes, and the\\nmedial half of the fourth toe.3,6\\nThe LPN leaves the lower calcaneal chamber and courses into the sole of the foot\\nthrough its own abductor canal, a potential site of entrapment for this nerve. It then\\npasses laterally and distally across the foot and divides into its terminal superficial\\nand deep branches. The LPN supplies motor innervation to the quadratus plantae\\n(QP), adductor hallucis, flexor digiti minimi brevis, lateral head of flexor hallucis bre-\\nvis, all interossei, and second to fourth lumbricals. Sensory innervation is supplied to\\nthe lateral sole of the foot, plantar surface of the fifth toe and lateral half of the\\nfourth toe.3,6\\nIn the upper tarsal tunnel, the first branch of the LPN (or Baxter’s nerve) can arise\\nfrom the LPN directly, as a trifurcation of the TN or just proximal to the bifurcation\\nof the MPN and LPN (directly off the TN). It enters the lower calcaneal chamber\\nbut then penetrates the posterior chamber and travels between the AH and\\nQP in the medial heel, which is a possible site of compression. It then courses\\nlaterally, and just anterior to the medial aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity, between\\nQP and FDB.3 The nerve can be compressed by a heel spur at the medial calcaneal\\ntuberosity or involved in chronic plantar fasciitis 7 at the same site. The\\nfirst branch of the LPN always terminates with motor innervation to the abductor\\ndigiti minimi pedis (also known as abdu ctor digiti quinti pedis); it can also\\ngive motor branches to QP and FDB. In addition, the first branch of the LPN\\nsupplies periosteal afferent branches to the calcaneus but not cutaneous,\\ninnervation.4\\nSural Nerve\\nIn the popliteal fossa the sciatic nerve divides into the TN and fibular nerve. The\\nTN gives rise to the medial sural cutaneous nerve in the popliteal fossa. In the\\nmid-calf it is joined by a communicating branch from the CFN (lateral sural\\ncutaneous nerve) to form the sural nerve.8 The sural nerve supplies sensation to\\nthe lateral ankle and heel, as well as the lateral foot. It does not provide any motor\\ninnervation.\\nSaphenous Nerve\\nThe saphenous nerve is a cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve that originates in\\nthe thigh. Below the knee it descends along the medial tibial border and enters the\\nfoot at the anteromedial ankle and supp lies sensation to the proximal medial\\ndorsum of the foot; it does not provide motor innervation.\\nGuiding Treatment for Foot Pain 785'),\n",

The clinical presentation can vary depending on the terminal\\nbranch affected but typically involves numbness, tingling, burning, cramping, or\\npainful paresthesias in the sole of the foot (medial and lateral aspect), plantar\\nheel, and plantar surface of the toes. Symptoms may be aggravated with prolonged\\nstanding or ambulation. Weakness is not commonly noted by patients but in severe\\ncases focal intrinsic foot muscle atrophy can be observed.3 Tinel sign over the\\nTN may be positive. Sensory deficit usually is noted in the sole of the foot, plantar\\naspect of the toes, and plantar heel.9 TTS can be caused by space occupying or\\ncompressive lesions; trauma; postsurgical, biomechanical traction on the\\nnerve; systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes mellitus; or\\nedema. Needle EMG examination is crucial in determining which TN branches\\nare affected.\\nThe MPN may be compressed in its abductor canal between the abductor hallucis\\nand its attachment to the talus and navicular bone. MPN mononeuropathy is some-\\ntimes referred to as “jogger’s foot” and may be seen in patients with hindfoot valgus\\nand pes planus. Patients often report exercise-induced pain on the medial plantar sur-\\nface of the foot, often radiating distally to the plantar surface of the first, second, and\\nthird toes (and possibly the medial half of the fourth toe).3,10 Dysesthesias or numb-\\nness may be present along the medial heel, arch, and medial sole of the foot and\\nthe first through third toes.\\nThe LPN enters the sole of the foot through its own abductor canal, formed by the\\nattachment of the abductor hallucis to the talus and navicular bone, which is a poten-\\ntial site of entrapment for the LPN. Symptoms of involvement of the LPN can include\\npain or paresthesias affecting the lateral plantar surface of the foot extending to the\\nplantar fifth toe and lateral half of the fourth toe.3\\nThe MCN can branch from the TN proximal to, within, or distal to the tarsal tunnel. A\\ncompressive lesion affecting the MCN can result in pain and paresthesias in the medial\\nheel and sensation may be reduced in medial, posterior, and plantar heel. There is\\ntypically no motor involvement as it is usually a purely sensory nerve.5\\nThe first branch of the LPN (or Baxter’s nerve) may be entrapped between the AH\\nand the medial edge of QP, where it is susceptible due to hyperpronation. Another\\nlocation of potential compression is between the FDB and the medial calcaneal tu-\\nberosity or due to a bone spur from the medial calcaneus. Patients often complain\\nof medial plantar heel pain similar to that of plantar fasciitis. In contrast to plantar\\nfasciitis, symptoms representative of a first branch lateral plantar neuropathy are\\nmore medial and proximal and tend to worsen with activity. Pain can radiate to\\nthe medial ankle or laterally across the proximal plantar foot. Paresthesias and\\nweakness are not typically reported, but clinical examination may reveal inability\\nto abduct the fifth toe.3,11,12\\nFibular Neuropathy\\nThe DFN can be entrapped under the inferior extensor retinaculum, often referred to as\\nanterior TTS. Tight or rigid footwear may cause compression of the DFN and the nerve\\ncan be injured by local trauma. The lateral and/or medial branches of the DFN may be\\naffected.

It may also be injured in an inversion ankle sprain or functional\\nankle instability due to a traction injury to the nerve. Symptoms often involve pain\\nand paresthesias in the dorsal ankle and foot, typically sparing the first dorsal web\\nspace and plantar foot. There is no motor involvement because distally the SFN sup-\\nplies only sensory innervation.8,13\\nThe most frequent fibular neuropathy is compression of the CFN at the fibular\\nhead. This can occur due to sitting with crossed legs, rapid weight loss or wasting\\nof the leg musculature (particularly in the setting of prolonged bed rest), prolonged\\nsquatting, or other external compression or stretch of the nerve. Proximal fibular\\nfracture or nerve injury associated with surgical positioning, knee arthroscopy, or\\narthroplasty may also result in CFN injury.8,14 Both the superficial and the deep\\nbranches can be affected resulting in ankle dorsiflexor weakness (foot drop) and\\nvariable pain or paresthesias in the distal lateral leg and dorsum of the foot and\\nankle.\\nSural Neuropathy\\nIsolated sural neuropathies are rare but can occur due to local trauma, fractures,\\nganglia, or compression by fibrotic bands or tight boots. The most common\\nentrapment sites are along the lateral border of the ankle, the calcaneus, and\\nthe fifth metatarsal. In addition, sural neuropathy is often secondary to ankle sur-\\ngery and the subsequent scarring, bony hypertrophy, or instability. The sural nerve\\nmay also be injured during ankle arthroscopic surgery.

The neuroma consists primarily of perineural fibrosis and degenerative\\nchanges. Patients typically complain of burning or electrical pain in the web space\\nand sometimes paresthesias.

Sensory NCS are typically normal\\nas most causes of radiculopathy occur proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. A signifi-\\ncant degree of axonal loss of the L5, S1, or S2 nerve roots must occur before compound\\nmuscle action potential amplitudes in motor NCS demonstrate abnormalities, typically\\noccurring only in advanced cases of radiculopathy. Needle EMG examination is more\\nsensitive for axonal loss than NCS. In addition to intrinsic foot muscles, proximal leg\\nmuscles with L5 and S1 innervation as well as lumbar paraspinals should be examined.\\nA radiculopathy is implied with EMG abnormalities in 2 or more muscles with different\\nperipheral nerve supply but the same nerve root involvement, including the lumbar par-\\naspinals. In addition, needle EMG findings should be normal in adjacent myotomes.8\\nPeripheral Neuropathy\\nThe most common pattern of peripheral neuropathy is a distal, symmetric length-\\ndependent process resulting initially in bilateral foot symptoms. The pattern of NCS\\nfindings can help determine if the process is primarily axonal or demyelinating in na-\\nture, which can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Sensory and motor NCS\\ncan show prolonged latencies, decreased conduction velocity, and reduced ampli-\\ntudes in multiple peripheral nerves. In addition, in an axonal process, needle EMG find-\\nings would typically reveal abnormal spontaneous activity and possibly motor unit\\naction potential morphology changes in distal foot and leg muscles but not more prox-\\nimal leg muscles with similar nerve root innervation.8\\nNONNEUROGENIC CAUSES OF FOOT PAIN\\nThere are numerous nonneuropathic causes of foot and ankle pain that can mimic\\nneuropathic conditions and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. A care-\\nful history and physical examination can typically assist in narrowing the cause of the\\nsymptoms. Nonneuropathic causes do not tend to cause paresthesias or sensory\\nloss. Although not always necessary to make a diagnosis, EDX studies would be ex-\\npected to be normal in these conditions.\\nPlantar fasciitis is a common overuse condition of the plantar fascia at its attach-\\nment to the calcaneus. Heel pain is a primary complaint, often worse in the morning\\nand with initial steps but improves during the day. Point tenderness at the medial\\ncalcaneal tuberosity may extend along the medial border of the plantar fascia and\\nstretching the fascia may reproduce pain. Plantar heel pain can be due to fat pad\\ncontusion (or atrophy) due to excessive heel strike. Calcaneal stress fracture can\\nresult from marching or running, typically insidious in onset. Tenderness can be pre-\\nsent over the medial or lateral calcaneus, and pain can be reproduced by squeezing\\nthe calcaneus.17\\nThe Achilles tendon inserts at the posterior calcaneus and is a common cause of\\nposterior heel pain. Achilles tendinopathy is an overuse tendon injury, although partial\\nor complete tears can also occur. Achilles regional pain often develops gradually with\\npain and stiffness on waking that can improve with walking. Retrocalcaneal bursitis is\\nanother common cause of posterior heel pain as the retrocalcaneal bursa lies between\\nthe posterior aspect of the calcaneus and the insertion of the Achilles tendon and can\\nbecome inflamed.17\\nAnkle sprains most commonly result from inversion injuries rather than eversion due\\nto the relative weakness of the lateral ligaments compared with the medial ligament.\\nThe most common site of pain is over the anterolateral ankle involving the anterior talo-\\nfibular ligament.

The sensory NCS\\nconsist of MPN, LPN, superficial fibular, deep fibular, sural, medial calcaneal, and\\nsaphenous nerves while the mixed NCS are composed of MPN and LPN. It is the au-\\nthor’s experience that due to the time commitment necessary to perform sensory NCS\\nof the MPN and LPN (averaging >100 stimuli) and the relatively small amplitude of the\\naveraged response that is recorded (2–5mV), these sensory NCS can be challenging\\nand therefore, diagnostic utility may be of limited value (Table 1).\\nNeedle Electromyography Examination\\nAlong with NCS, the needle EMG examination is a vital and necessary part of the\\nEDX evaluation of any patient presenting with foot pain, numbness, and/or tingling.\\nMoreover, in the author’s clinical experience due to the subtle nature of the electro-\\nphysiologic findings and pathophysiology associated with entrapment neuropathies\\nin the foot, the needle EMG examination of intrinsic foot muscles may likely be more\\nsensitive than the motor and sensory NCS. To evaluate specific TN branches and\\nthe DFN, multiple intrinsic foot muscles can be studied during the needle EMG ex-\\namination.

Bove, M.D., Ph.D.\\nTemple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\nLifestyle management plays an important role in the world \\nof cardiovascular care, and for most cardiovascular diseases, \\nexercise is listed as an essential component of lifestyle advice. The \\nrecent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and \\nAmerican Heart Association include an entire section on how to \\nuse lifestyle information to optimally manage patients with or at \\nrisk for cardiovascular disease.1 Many of our patients are older \\nadults, and many have heart failure with preserved or reduced \\nejection fraction. We may be consulted by middle aged or younger \\nindividuals who want to compete in sports events. Distance runs \\nand triathlons are becoming more popular, and many adults \\nconsult a cardiologist before participating in competitive sports. \\nSince cardiologists will likely need to provide exercise advice \\nto nearly all of our patients, it is important to understand the \\ncirculatory and pulmonary physiology involved in exercise. \\nThe paper on pulmonary aspects of exercise points out several \\nimportant concepts that can be applied to all patients. Data are \\nnow clear that exercise improves left ventricular compliance, and \\na highly compliant ventricle that can relax rapidly is essential \\nto minimizing dyspnea with exercise. The fact that exercise can \\nbe used as a therapeutic measure in heart failure with preserved \\nejection fraction provides a tool to help manage patients with this \\nform of cardiovascular disease. The lung responses to exercise \\nfollow the hemodynamic changes. Cardiologists are seeing athletes \\nwith swimming-induced pulmonary edema, and a discussion of \\nthe disorder is provided in the first review. Similarly, a resurgence \\nof the sport of deep breath hold diving supports the need for \\nan understanding of the dynamics of this activity, which also is \\nprovided in the first paper. Indeed, recent data show that even \\nnormal athletes exercising to extremes can develop pulmonary \\nedema in the background of normal lungs. Many of these patients \\nappear in the cardiologist office for evaluation of cardiac status, \\nand most do not show significant cardiac pathology.\\nThe paper by Zaleski et al. provides a detailed background \\non how to inform older adults (> 65 years old) about the value \\nof exercise. This group of patients constitutes many in our daily \\npractice, and while we focus on managing comorbidities such as \\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic stable angina, and valvular \\nheart disease, lifestyle advice remains one of the key additions \\nthat we should provide for this population. Zaleski and colleagues \\npoint out that the expanding older population must manage \\na number of comorbidities as they age, and they offer specific \\nrecommendations so that the cardiologist can provide advice about \\nexercise based on well-established guidelines. Of importance in \\nthis group is the need for resistance exercise to aide in maintaining \\nbone health, balance, and general conditioning. The first \\nconsideration for cardiologists who advise older individuals about \\nexercise programs is safety. Since many older patients have some \\ndegree of coronary atherosclerosis, the risk of a coronary event \\nshould be the primary consideration when providing exercise \\nadvice. This risk can be stratified with a medical history and an \\norganized process of health screening. The screening process is \\ndescribed in detail in this paper and can be used to manage the \\nolder adult who embarks on an exercise program.\\nThe series then moves from the healthy adult to the adult \\npatient with heart failure—a population that is projected to exceed \\n8.5 million by 2030. 2 As with other cardiovascular disorders, \\nlifestyle is an important component of care. Although the use \\nof exercise therapy in heart failure patients has been supported \\nby several clinical trials, the most recent being the HF-ACTION \\nstudy,3  Alvarez and colleagues point out that only 10.4% of \\neligible heart failure patients receive cardiac rehabilitation after \\nhospitalization. They go on to provide several methods for \\nassessing exercise capacity in these patients and the limitations \\nimposed by left ventricular dysfunction. They also review the \\nbenefits of exercise in VAD and transplant patients. For centers \\nthat manage patients with advanced heart failure, most have the \\ncapacity for formal cardiopulmonary exercise testing that provides \\na measure of actual maximum oxygen consumption. While this is \\nthe best way to evaluate exercise capacity in heart failure patients, \\na commonly used alternative is the 6-minute walk test that \\nmeasures how far a heart failure patient can walk in 6 minutes. \\nThis is something that can easily be done in an office or hospital \\nsetting, without a formal testing area. \\nThere is a growing population of patients who have heart \\nfailure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This is due \\nto the increasing lifespan of our cardiac patients, the incidence \\nof hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in the \\npopulation, and the presence of coronary disease, either overt \\nor occult. While HFpEF has become a dominant cause of clinical \\nheart failure in the older population, most clinical trials have failed \\nto show an advantage for our usual heart failure medications. \\nGupte and Hamilton provide an excellent overview of this \\ngrowing problem for the clinical cardiologist. Their review of the \\npathophysiology highlights the problem of elevated end diastolic \\npressure, failure of LV relaxation, and pulmonary venous pressure \\nthat leads first to dyspnea and then to overt pulmonary edema. \\nThe mechanisms are a subset of similar mechanisms that occur in \\nnormal hearts and in athletes who extend their exercise capacity \\nbeyond limits of normal pulmonary capillary pressure. Recent \\nstudies demonstrate that exercise training can reduce diastolic \\nstiffness and improve exercise capacity. Even so, HFpEF is a \\ngrowing challenge in cardiology practice since the mechanisms \\ncausing this disorder are not well understood, and both basic and \\nclinical research is needed to improve our care of these patients.\\nNext, Wasfy and colleagues take us in a different direction, \\npointing out the concern for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in \\nathletes. This has become a timely topic that involves several \\nissues, including screening, selection of athletes with heart \\ndisease for sport participation, and the continuing question of \\nhow to detect the at-risk athlete before an event occurs. For the \\nadult athlete over age 35, the most common cause of SCD is \\ncoronary disease; therefore, this population needs evaluation \\nand screening for SCD risk based on well-defined risk factors \\nEDITORIAL'),\n",

Guideline-directed \\nscreening, including stress testing, should be considered in \\nthis population. For younger athletes, where etiology is often \\nan inherited disorder (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, \\ndilated cardiomyopathy, channelopathies, Marfan syndrome), \\nthe authors highlight the American Heart Association’s \\n12-point history and physical examination, which is the \\ncurrent standard for athletic participation.4  For these athletes, \\nelectrocardiographic (ECG) screening remains controversial. \\nThe authors emphasize that athletic screenings should be done \\nby cardiologists familiar with the physiologic changes that \\noccur in the heart with physical training. Without this in-depth \\nknowledge, many athletes will be stigmatized with a cardiac \\ndiagnosis based on ECG or imaging data that reflects normal \\ncardiac adaptations to physical training. This advice follows \\nseveral years of controversy about ECG screening of athletes and \\nthe continuing concern for high false-positive rates, particularly \\nwhen interpretation is based on usual ECG criteria and the \\nreader is unfamiliar with expected ECG changes in a trained \\nathlete. \\nThe paper by Lisman provides the details needed to understand \\nadaptive cardiac changes in athletes. He discusses how specific \\ntypes of training can produce cardiac changes that may appear \\nabnormal on the ECG and consequently lead to high false-positive \\nrates that exclude healthy individuals. By using the Seattle criteria \\nto interpret the ECG in athletes, Lisman shows how cardiologists \\ncan differentiate between normal versus abnormal cardiac changes \\nthat may signal an underlying condition and how these criteria \\nhave reduced the number of false-positive readings. \\nFor the cardiologist involved in screening athletes of any age, \\nmuch of the information provided here will be invaluable for \\nhelping patients who wish to start an exercise program, compete \\nin sports events, use exercise as a therapeutic tool for improving \\nheart failure symptoms, or reduce cardiovascular risk as part of \\nlifestyle goals for prevention.

The book is not a substitute  \\nfor expert medical advice, however, and is not to be relied on for medical, healthcare, \\npharmaceutical, or other professional advice on specific circumstances and in specific \\nlocations. You are advised always to consult a doctor or other health professional for \\nspecific information on personal health matters. Please consult your physician before \\nchanging, stopping, or starting any medical treatment. Never disregard expert medical \\nadvice or delay in seeking advice or treatment due to information obtained from this \\nbook. The naming of any product, treatment, or organization in this book does not \\nimply endorsement by the Medical Editor, other consultants or contributors, editor,  \\nor publisher, nor does the omission of any such names indicate disapproval. Neither \\nthe author, publisher, Medical Editor, consultants, contributors, nor editor shall be \\nliable or responsible for any injury, loss, or damage allegedly arising from any \\ninformation or suggestion in this book.\\nA NOTE ON GENDER IDENTITIES\\nDK recognizes all gender identities, and acknowledges that the sex someone was \\nassigned at birth, based on their sexual organs, may not align with their gender \\nidentity. People may identify as any gender (including genders outside the male/\\nfemale binary) or as no gender, and their gender identity may change during their \\nlifetime. As gender language, and its use in our society, evolves, the scientific and \\nmedical communities continue to reassess their own phrasing. Please note, this book \\nuses “women” to refer to people who were assigned as female at birth on the basis of \\ntheir sexual organs, and “men” to refer to people who were assigned male at birth on \\nthe basis of their sexual organs.\\nA NOTE ON SKIN SYMPTOMS\\nVarious conditions may produce a rash or discolouration of the skin, and the \\nappearance of the affected area can be different on different skin tones. For example,  \\na heat rash typically appears as a collection of small pink or red spots on pale skin \\nwhereas on brown or black skin the spots may appear gray or white. In this book,  \\nskin rashes and discoloration are generally described as they appear on paler skin.  \\nIt may be difficult to identify them on darker skin tones, but they may be easier to see \\non the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, tongue, or inside the eyelids, if any  \\nof those areas is affected. With certain conditions, discoloration may affect the skin \\nand the whites of the eyes (appearing yellow in jaundice, for example), and the eye \\ndiscoloration should be detectable regardless of a person’s skin color.\\nUS_008-009_How_to_use_this_book.indd   8US_008-009_How_to_use_this_book.indd   8 09/09/2021   12:1209/09/2021   12:12'),\n",

A cross-\\nreference links to an easy-to-follow description of the \\ncondition in Part 3. \\nAll conditions are given a rating to suggest the \\nurgency with which treatment should be sought. \\nPotentially life-threatening situations and ailments  \\nthat need urgent medical advice are clearly flagged. \\nSymptoms usually resolve without specific treatment. \\nText may state to seek medical advice if condition persists,  \\nor in particular groups, such as children.\\nSee a doctor (or dentist, if appropriate) for advice, \\ndiagnosis, and potential treatment within a few days. Text \\nwill say if medical attention is needed sooner. \\nGet medical attention or advice as soon as  \\npossible, either by telephone or by visiting the emergency \\ndepartment. Additional text will tell you if the condition  \\nis a medical emergency.\\nSeek urgent medical attention if you or the person \\naffected has the symptoms listed. These usually need \\nimmediate treatment and may be life-threatening.\\nSkin symptoms, such as rashes, spots, or areas of \\ndiscoloration, may be variable or harder to identify on  \\ndarker skin, see p.8.\\nKEY TO SYMBOLS\\nSymbols indicate whether medical advice  \\nis needed and how urgently this should be sought.\\n    \\n \\nSpecial panels group conditions \\ntogether under various criteria— \\nfor example, by age-related or \\ngender-specific issues.\\nPART 1 WHOLE-BODY SYMPTOM GUIDE\\nThis part of the book covers general unwellness and \\nfull-body symptoms grouped together under general \\nsymptoms, such as Nausea and Vomiting.\\n22\\nWHOLE-BODY SYMPTOM GUIDE\\nNAUSEA AND VOMITING 2322\\nNAUSEA  \\nAND VOMITING\\nMigraine (p.166)   \\nOften one-sided headache, with blurred \\nvision and flashing lights. \\nMeningitis (p.168)    \\nRash, fever, headache, stiff neck, and general \\nunwellness.

Sometimes, \\none or more vertebrae may fracture and \\ncrumble, leading to pain and progressive \\nloss of height.\\nTreatment is with calcium and vitamin  \\nD supplements, regular exercise to build  \\nup and maintain bone strength, and \\nmedication to help prevent bone loss and \\nreduce the risk of fractures. Hormone \\nreplacement therapy may also be suggested \\nfor some postmenopausal women, but it is \\nnot generally recommended because of  \\nthe increased risk of adverse effects from \\nlong-term use, such as breast cancer.\\nOSTEOMYELITIS\\nOsteomyelitis is infection of a bone, \\nusually due to injury, surgery, or the spread \\nof infection from elsewhere in the body. \\nOften, the infection is with Staphylococcus \\naureus bacteria; other possible causes \\ninclude tuberculosis and fungal infection. \\nIn acute osteomyelitis, symptoms \\ndevelop suddenly and may include fever \\nand severe pain in the affected bone. In \\nchronic osteomyelitis, symptoms develop \\ngradually and may include mild fever and \\npersistent pain in the affected bone.\\nTreatment is with antibiotics or antifungal \\ndrugs. Surgery to remove the affected area \\nof bone may also be necessary.\\nSPONDYLOLYSIS\\nSpondylolysis is a disorder of the spine  \\nin which part of the fifth (or, rarely, the \\nfourth) lumbar vertebra in the lower  \\nback consists of soft, fibrous tissue  \\ninstead of normal bone. As a result, the \\naffected vertebra is weak and vulnerable to \\ndamage under stress, which may produce \\nspondylolisthesis (forward slippage of the \\nvertebra over the one below it, p.158). \\nIf spondylolisthesis does occur, it may \\nproduce symptoms such as pain and \\nstiffness and require treatment. Otherwise, \\nspondylolysis usually produces no \\nsymptoms and treatment is not needed.\\nAVASCULAR NECROSIS\\nAvascular necrosis is death of part of  \\na bone due to disruption of its blood \\nsupply, usually as a result of an injury  \\nto the bone, such as a fracture. It most \\ncommonly affects the shoulder, hip, or \\nknee. It may not produce any obvious \\nsymptoms in the early stages, but later \\nthere is often persistent, gradually \\nworsening pain in the affected area.  \\nTreatment of avascular necrosis  \\ndepends on the amount of bone  \\ndamage, but may include medication,  \\nor, if there is extensive damage to the \\nbone, surgery, such as a bone graft  \\nor joint replacement. \\nPeriosteum (outer \\nmembrane)\\nHard (cortical) bone \\nbecomes less dense\\nSpongy \\n(cancellous) \\nbone \\nbecomes \\nless dense\\nEnlarged \\nmedullary canal\\nMedullary \\ncanal\\nHard (cortical) \\nbone\\nSpongy \\n(cancellous)  \\nbone\\nUS_154-165_Musculoskeletal_system_disorders.indd   154US_154-165_Musculoskeletal_system_disorders.indd   154 07/09/2021   15:3307/09/2021   15:33'),\n",

It occurs most commonly in \\nteenagers who play a lot of sports and  \\nis thought to be caused by excessive, \\nrepetitive pulling of the quadriceps  \\nmuscle at the front of the thigh, which is \\ntransmitted to the tibial tuberosity. The \\npain is usually worse during physical \\nactivity and eases with rest. Usually, only \\none leg is affected.\\nTreatment is not usually needed,  \\napart from rest and pain relievers, and the \\ncondition typically clears up within a few \\nweeks or months.\\nBONE SPURS\\nAlso known as osteophytes, bone spurs  \\nare bony lumps that grow on bones, \\naround joints, or on the vertebrae (spinal \\nbones). Bone spurs often develop in \\nosteoarthritis (p.157), cervical spondylosis \\n(osteoarthritis of the neck, p.158), and \\nankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of \\nthe vertebrae, p.158). They commonly \\naffect the neck, shoulder, knee, lower  \\nback, fingers, or toes. Heel spurs are  \\noften caused by repeated damage to  \\nfoot muscles and ligaments. They are \\ncommon in athletes.\\nBone spurs do not always cause \\nsymptoms. If they do, symptoms may \\ninclude pain; restricted movement; and \\ntingling, numbness, or weakness in the \\naffected area. \\nTreatment is usually with pain relievers;  \\nif movement is restricted, physical therapy \\nmay be helpful.

There is also often \\nbleeding, which may sometimes be  \\nsevere. Traumatic vertebrae (spinal) \\nfractures may also damage the spinal  \\ncord or spinal nerves, which may lead  \\nto paralysis of part of the body. \\nTreatment usually involves immobilizing \\nthe affected part in a cast until the bone \\nheals.

In adults, \\nkyphosis is typically due to poor posture, \\nweakening of the vertebrae usually caused \\nby osteoporosis (p.154), or obesity. In \\nscoliosis, the spine is curved to the left or \\nright, most commonly in the chest area  \\nor lower back region. It may cause leaning \\nto one side and sometimes back pain. \\nScoliosis usually starts in childhood or \\nadolescence and tends to become \\nprogressively worse until growth stops. \\nTreatment is similar for all types of spinal \\ncurvature.

If they cause pain or impede \\nmovement, they can be drained or \\nremoved surgically.\\n JOINT INSTABILITY\\nShoulder instability\\nNormally, the bones, ligaments, and \\nmuscles of a joint work together to \\nsupport the various parts of the joint in \\ntheir correct positions while also allowing \\nthe full range of motion of the joint. In \\njoint instability, there is lack of support, \\nwith the result that the joint may not  \\nmove correctly or may be dislocated  \\nBUNION\\nA bunion is a thickened lump at the base \\nof the big toe. The underlying cause is  \\na minor bone deformity, called hallux \\nvalgus, in which the joint at the base of  \\nthe big toe projects outward, forcing the \\ntoe to turn inward. Pressure on the \\nprojecting bone causes the surrounding \\ntissues to thicken, forming a bunion. A \\nbunion may be painful and may become \\ninflamed and callused. \\nSmall bunions may be remedied  \\nby using a bunion splint to straighten  \\nthe big toe. For a large or troublesome \\nbunion, surgery to remove the protruding \\narea of bone and straighten the big toe \\nmay be recommended.\\nBunion\\nAn abnormal outward \\nprojection of the \\njoint at the base of \\nthe big toe leads \\nto thickening of \\nthe soft tissues \\naround the \\njoint, resulting \\nin a bunion.\\nPATELLOFEMORAL PAIN \\nSYNDROME\\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome is the \\nmedical term for pain around the front  \\nof the knee that is not associated with  \\nany signs of damage or problems in the \\nknee. Typically, the pain is worse when \\nwalking up or down stairs. There may also \\nbe swelling around the kneecap and a \\ngrating sensation when the knee is bent  \\nor straightened. It is common in people \\nwho play sports. \\nTreatment is with rest, pain relievers,  \\nand physical therapy. It make take several \\nmonths to recover fully, and sometimes \\nthe condition persists for years.\\nTORN KNEE CARTILAGE\\nMeniscus tear\\nThe knee contains two pads of cartilage \\n(menisci) that act as shock absorbers \\nbetween the femur (thigh bone) and  \\ntibia (shinbone). Tearing of the cartilage  \\n(a meniscus tear) usually occurs as a  \\nresult of a sudden twisting of the leg;  \\nit is a common sports injury. Symptoms \\ntypically include sudden pain in the knee, \\nswelling of the knee, and difficulty \\nstraightening the leg.\\nA mild tear may be treated with rest and \\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A \\nsevere tear may require surgery to repair \\nor remove the damaged cartilage.\\nPLICA SYNDROME\\nThe plica is a fold of membrane in the knee \\nthat is thought to be tissue that normally \\ndisappears during fetal development but \\npersists after birth in some people. Its \\npresence or absence makes no difference  \\nto the functioning of the knee. In plica \\nsyndrome, the plica becomes inflamed, \\ncausing pain at the inside front of the  \\nknee. The pain is usually associated with \\nbending the knee and becomes worse \\nduring and after exercise. \\nTreatment is with rest, pain relievers,  \\nand corticosteroid injections to reduce \\ninflammation. If this treatment is \\nunsuccessful, surgery may be suggested.\\nBAKER'S CYST\\nA Baker’s cyst is a fluid-filled swelling  \\nthat develops at the back of the knee. It \\nmay be a feature of disorders such as \\nosteoarthritis (p.157) and rheumatoid \\narthritis (p.157), and it may also be caused \\nby a knee injury. Most cysts are painless. \\nOccasionally a cyst may rupture, causing \\npain in the calf.\\nIn many cases, the cyst disappears by \\nitself. A large or painful cyst may be treated \\nwith pain relievers and corticosteroids to \\nreduce inflammation. Rarely, a cyst may \\nneed to be drained or surgically removed.\\neasily. In shoulder instability, for example, \\nthe shoulder joint feels abnormally loose, \\nand there may also be symptoms such  \\nas tingling, numbness, or weakness in  \\nthe arm. In extreme cases, the shoulder \\nmay dislocate. \\nTreatment may involve physical therapy \\nand anti-inflammatory medication or \\nsurgery to stabilize or repair the joint.  \\nIf the joint has dislocated, it will need to  \\nbe manipulated back into position.\\nProtruding \\npart of joint\\nSoft tissue \\nbecomes \\nthickened\\nUS_154-165_Musculoskeletal_system_disorders.indd   160US_154-165_Musculoskeletal_system_disorders.indd   160 07/09/2021   15:3307/09/2021   15:33\"),\n",

In most cases, it is due \\nto the rupture of an aneurysm—a swollen, \\nweakened area at the junction between two \\narteries in the brain. In some people, \\nbleeding is due to malformed blood \\nvessels. Either problem may be present \\nfrom birth. A subarachnoid hemorrhage \\nmay also occur spontaneously or after \\nunaccustomed exercise. \\nThe bleeding typically causes a sudden, \\nviolent headache, with vomiting, stiff neck, \\nand sensitivity to bright light.

They may include \\nheadache, vomiting, drowsiness, paralysis \\naffecting one side of the body, and seizures \\n(“fits”). Anyone with these symptoms \\nshould seek urgent medical advice. A \\nhematoma may occur after a person \\nbriefly loses consciousness at the time of \\nan injury and then loses consciousness \\nagain hours later.

Chronic \\nbleeding may result from an apparently \\ntrivial head injury, and it may take up to \\nseveral months before symptoms develop. \\nThese typically include headaches, gradual \\nconfusion, weakness, and a decline in \\nconsciousness. Rapid bleeding usually \\nfollows a severe head injury and typically \\ncauses rapid loss of consciousness. A \\nperson who develops any of these \\nsymptoms should seek urgent medical \\nattention.

It is \\ncaused by an abnormal gene, and if a \\nperson inherits the gene from either parent, \\nhe or she will develop the disorder. In most \\ncases, symptoms do not appear until age 35 \\nto 50. The condition usually progresses for \\nabout 10 to 25 years until the person \\neventually dies. There is no cure for the \\ncondition, but medication may relieve some \\nof the symptoms. Those at risk can be tested \\nto see if they have the abnormal gene.\\nPARKINSON’S DISEASE\\nParkinson’s disease is a progressive \\ndisorder that causes tremors (involuntary \\ntrembling movements, usually of the \\nhands), slow movement, and stiffness. It \\nresults from degeneration of cells in a part \\nof the brain that produces dopamine,  a \\nchemical that helps to fine-tune muscle \\nmovements. In Parkinson’s disease, the \\ncells produce much less dopamine, \\nresulting in impaired muscle control. \\nIn most people, there is no obvious cause \\nof the condition, although genetic factors \\nmay be involved in some cases. It can also \\nresult from an inflammation of the brain \\n(encephalitis) or from damage to the basal \\nganglia from drugs or repeated head \\ninjuries. The main symptoms are trembling \\nof one hand, arm, or leg, which may \\nprogress to affect limbs on the opposite \\nside; muscle stiffness, making it difficult to \\nbegin moving and making movements \\nslower; and problems with balance. Other \\nsymptoms may include a stooped posture, \\nshuffling walk, problems speaking, loss of \\nfacial expression, and difficulty swallowing. \\nSome people also develop dementia \\n(opposite) or depression (p.242).\\nTreatment may include supportive \\ntherapies, such as physical therapy, and \\nmedication to improve symptoms. In  \\nsome cases, surgery may be an option.\\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), nerve cells in  \\nthe brain and spinal cord become \\nprogressively damaged, causing problems \\nwith a wide range of body functions. \\nElectrical signals pass between the brain \\nand body along the nerves. Healthy nerves \\nare covered by a protective sheath of a \\nsubstance called myelin, which facilitates \\nthe passage of nerve signals. MS involves \\nprogressive destruction of the myelin \\nsheaths, disrupting the transmission of \\nsignals. MS is an autoimmune disease, in \\nwhich the body’s immune system attacks \\nthe myelin sheaths. The underlying cause \\nis unknown, although genetic and \\nenvironmental factors may play a role. \\nCAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME\\nIn this condition, nerves at the base of  \\nthe spinal cord—the cauda equina, a \\n“spray” of nerves resembling a horse’s tail—\\nbecome compressed, causing symptoms \\nsuch as back pain, bowel and bladder \\nproblems, numbness, leg weakness, and \\nerectile dysfunction. The cause is usually  \\na disc herniation (slipped disc, p.158),  \\nbut cauda equina syndrome may also \\nsometimes be caused by infection, a spinal \\ninjury, or bone cancer. Urgent treatment is \\nusually with emergency surgery to relieve \\nthe pressure on the affected nerves.\\nAMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS\\nIn amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also \\nknown as Lou Gehrig’s disease, there is \\nprogressive degeneration of motor nerves \\n(nerves that control movement) in the spinal \\ncord. The disorder also affects muscles: as the \\nmotor nerves lose the ability to stimulate \\nmuscle activity, the muscles weaken and \\nwaste away. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \\nusually begins after the age of about 50, \\nalthough rarely it may occur in childhood or \\nadolescence. The cause is unknown, although \\nin a few people there is a genetic susceptibility.\\nInitially, symptoms develop over a few \\nmonths, with weakness and wasting in  \\nthe hands, arms, and legs. Other early \\nsymptoms of ALS may include twitching, \\nstiffness, muscle cramps, and sometimes \\nspeech problems. \\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms \\nworsen and cause problems with everyday \\nactivities, such as holding objects, climbing \\nstairs, and walking. Mental abilities are \\nusually not impaired, although control of \\nemotions may be affected and some people \\nbecome depressed. Eventually, the muscles \\nthat control breathing are affected and \\nbecome weakened, and the person dies. \\nThere is no cure for amyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis, although treatment may relieve \\nsome of the symptoms and slow \\nprogression of the disease.\\nLate-stage MS \\nAs the disorder progresses, there is \\nincreasing damage to myelin sheaths,  \\nand more nerves become affected.  \\nNerve damage is irreversible.\\nEarly-stage MS\\nWhite blood cells (cells from the \\nimmune system) attack the myelin \\nsheaths on the nerves.

Sometimes, surgery  \\nis needed. \\nNEURALGIA\\nPostherpetic neuralgia \\nNeuralgia is pain caused by damage to,  \\nor irritation of, a nerve. The pain usually \\noccurs in brief bouts and may be severe. \\nSome types of neuralgia are features of  \\na specific disorder. In migraines (p.166), \\nthere may be a form that consists of \\nintense, radiating pain around one eye. \\nPostherpetic neuralgia is a burning pain \\nthat may occur at the site of an attack  \\nof shingles (herpes zoster, p.233) for \\nmonths or even years after the illness. \\nOther types of neuralgia result from \\ndisturbance of a particular nerve. For \\nexample, in trigeminal neuralgia, pain \\naffects one side of the face supplied by  \\nthe trigeminal nerve. Treatment for \\nneuralgia is usually with medication,  \\nor sometimes surgery.\\nTRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA\\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, \\nexcruciating pain on one side of the face \\ndue to a disorder of the trigeminal nerve, \\nwhich provides sensation from parts of the \\nface and controls some muscles used for \\nchewing. The cause is usually pressure on \\nthe nerve from a blood vessel or, rarely, \\nfrom a tumor. Attacks may last for a few \\nseconds to several minutes, and may be  \\nso severe that the person is unable to do \\nanything during them. Afterward, the pain \\nusually disappears completely. An attack \\nmay occur spontaneously, or may be \\ntriggered by actions such as chewing, \\ntalking, or touching the face. Attacks may \\nbe frequent, though in some cases there \\nmay be long periods of remission. \\nTreatment for this condition is usually \\nwith medication, although surgery may \\nsometimes be an option.\\nCOMPLEX REGIONAL  \\nPAIN SYNDROME\\nFormerly known by various names, \\nincluding causalgia and reflex sympathetic \\ndystrophy, complex regional pain syndrome \\nis a condition in which there is long-lasting \\npain, usually in an arm or leg, but \\nsometimes affecting other areas of the \\nbody as well. It is most often triggered by \\nan injury, but the pain is more severe and \\nlong-lasting than would be expected from \\nthe severity of the injury. The skin over the \\npainful area may be red and tender, or \\nblue, cold, and clammy. It may be so \\nsensitive that even a light touch may \\nprovoke intense pain.\\nComplex regional pain syndrome may \\ndevelop after either a minor or more \\nserious injury, including fractures, sprains \\nor strains, burns, or cuts. However, it is \\nunknown why some people develop the \\ncondition after such injuries whereas \\nothers do not. \\nThere is no cure for complex regional \\npain syndrome, but symptoms may be \\ncontrolled with a combination of \\nmedication, psychological therapy, and \\nphysical rehabilitation.\\nMedian \\nnerve\\nTendon \\nsheath \\nTendon\\nCarpal \\nligament \\nCarpal tunnel\\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow space formed by the \\nbones of the wrist and the carpal ligament over \\nthem.

At the ankle, the \\nnerve passes through the tarsal tunnel,  \\na space formed by the ankle bones and \\nbands of supporting tissue. \\nTarsal tunnel syndrome occurs if the \\nspace is constricted and the nerve is \\ncompressed, commonly as a result of \\noveruse, injury, or arthritis. Tarsal tunnel \\nsyndrome is also more common in people \\nwith a condition known as flatfeet. \\nTreatment is with rest, medication, or \\nsometimes surgery.\\nCERVICAL RADICULOPATHY\\nPinched nerve\\nCommonly called a pinched nerve, cervical \\nradiculopathy is a condition that results \\nwhen a nerve in the neck is irritated or \\ncompressed where it branches away  \\nfrom the spinal cord. It is mostly due to  \\na ruptured disc in the neck region of the \\nspine, or a spur (bony outgrowth) on a \\nspinal vertebra. The condition usually \\naffects one side and typically causes  \\npain that radiates from the neck to the \\nshoulder and arm; tingling in the fingers \\nand hand; muscle weakness in the \\nshoulder, arm, or hand; and numbness. \\nTreatment may include medication or,  \\nin some cases, surgery.\\nFACIAL NERVE PALSY\\nFacial nerve palsy, also known as Bell’s \\npalsy, is weakness of the facial muscles due \\nto damage or inflammation of the facial \\nnerve, which controls certain muscles in \\nthe face. It affects only one side of the face, \\ncausing an eyelid and the corner of the \\nmouth to droop. There may also be other \\nsymptoms, such as earache, increased \\nsensitivity to sound, and an altered sense \\nof taste. The cause is often unknown, but \\nsometimes palsy may be due to damage to \\nthe nerve caused by a tumor or surgery, or \\nthe palsy may be associated with a viral \\ninfection. Facial nerve palsy may be treated \\nwith medication or, if the palsy is due to \\ndamage, with surgery.\\nMERALGIA PARESTHETICA\\nIn meralgia paresthetica, there are \\nabnormal sensations, such as burning  \\npain, numbness, and tingling in the  \\nouter thigh. Symptoms are often made \\nworse by standing or walking. The \\ncondition is due to a specific nerve being \\ntrapped under a ligament in the groin.  \\nIn many cases, the cause is unknown, \\nalthough sometimes it can result from \\ninjury or overuse. It can also be associated \\nwith pregnancy and obesity. \\nTreatment for this condition is with rest \\nand medication, or rarely surgery.\\nMORTON’S NEUROMA\\nIn this condition, a nerve between the toe \\nbones becomes irritated and thickened. \\nUsually, the nerve affected is between the \\nthird and fourth toes, but sometimes the \\nnerve between the second and third toes \\ncan be the cause. The condition typically \\ncauses a tingling sensation between the \\ntoes, and pain in the ball of the foot or \\nbase of the toes. The pain is often worse \\nwhen walking or wearing tight shoes. \\nWearing wider shoes, rest, and pain \\nrelievers may relieve symptoms. Surgery \\nmay be advised to treat severe cases.\\nCourse of the sciatic nerve\\nThe sciatic nerve is formed where nerves from  \\nthe lower spinal cord combine to form one large \\nnerve. The nerve and its branches extend along \\nthe length of the leg and into the ankle and foot.\\nSCIATICA\\nSciatica is nerve pain caused by pressure \\non or damage to the sciatic nerve, which \\nruns from the base of the spinal cord down  \\nthe legs and into the feet. The pain usually \\naffects only one side, and most commonly \\noccurs in the buttock or thigh, although  \\nit may extend down to the foot. There  \\nmay also be numbness or weakness in  \\nthe affected area.\\nSciatica is most commonly caused by  \\na herniated disc—the rupture of a disc in \\nthe spine (commonly also called a slipped \\ndisc, p.158)—pressing on the sciatic nerve. \\nOther causes include a muscle spasm, \\nsitting awkwardly for long periods, a  \\nspinal injury or infection, or, rarely, a tumor \\nthat presses on the nerve. It may also \\ndevelop during pregnancy, due to posture \\nchanges causing pressure on the sciatic \\nnerve. In many cases, symptoms resolve \\non their own.

It is caused by injury to the ear \\nthat has caused bleeding in the soft \\ncartilage, as may happen during contact \\nsports. Severe or repeated hematomas \\nmay result in permanent deformity of  \\nthe outer ear, a condition commonly \\ncalled cauliflower ear. \\nImmediate treatment is with ice packs  \\nto reduce swelling. In severe cases, the \\nhematoma may be drained and a \\ncompression bandage applied. Cosmetic \\nsurgery may be needed to correct a \\ncauliflower ear.\\nEAR AND EYE DISORDERS\\nOTITIS EXTERNA   \\nIn otitis externa, the outer ear canal \\nbecomes inflamed, usually due to a bacterial, \\nviral, or fungal infection. It is sometimes \\ncalled “swimmer’s ear,” because persistent \\nmoisture in the ear increases the risk of \\ninfection. The condition may also occur  \\nas part of a general skin disorder, such as \\neczema (p.222).\\nSymptoms of otitis externa include \\nswelling, discharge of pus from the ear, \\nitchiness or pain in the ear canal, and \\nsometimes temporary hearing loss. Often \\nthe only treatment needed is to keep the \\near clean and dry until the infection clears \\nup. If it persists or is severe, medication to \\ntreat the infection and relieve symptoms \\nmay be prescribed.\\nEARWAX\\nAlso called cerumen, earwax is produced \\nby glands in the outer ear canal to clean \\nand moisten the canal. Normally, the wax \\nemerges naturally, but sometimes it builds  \\nup and causes a blockage, producing a \\nfeeling of fullness in the ear and impairing \\nhearing. Wax blockage can usually be \\ntreated with eardrops. Persistent blockage \\nmay need treatment to flush out the ears \\nor suck out the wax.\\nSENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS\\nSensorineural hearing loss is hearing loss \\ncaused by damage to sensory nerves in  \\nthe ear or the nerve that carries auditory \\ninformation to the brain. It is usually due \\nto age or prolonged exposure to noise. \\nHowever, it may also sometimes be \\npresent at birth or result from various \\ndisorders. Sensorineural hearing loss is \\nusually permanent. Hearing aids may be \\nhelpful in some cases. With profound \\ndeafness, a cochlear implant may allow \\nhearing of sounds such as speech.\\nPRESBYCUSIS\\nA form of sensorineural deafness, \\npresbycusis is progressive loss of hearing \\nthat occurs with age. It is due to the \\nnatural degeneration and death of sensory \\nnerve cells in the ear. Both ears are usually \\naffected. The loss of hearing causes \\ndifficulty in hearing high-pitched sounds \\nand difficulty in hearing speech clearly, \\nespecially if there is background noise.\\nThere is no cure for presbycusis, but  \\nin most cases hearing can be improved \\nwith hearing aids.\\nAURICULAR CHONDRITIS\\nAuricular chondritis is inflammation of  \\nthe cartilage of the auricle (outer flap  \\nof the ear), usually as a result of a bacterial \\ninfection after a cut to the outer ear or  \\near piercing. The infection causes \\ninflammation, swelling, and pain in the \\nouter ear. Treatment with antibiotics \\nusually clears up the infection.\\nOTOSCLEROSIS\\nIn otosclerosis, there is abnormal growth \\nof bone around the stapes, one of the \\nthree tiny bones in the middle ear that \\ntransmit sounds to the inner ear. The \\nstapes gradually becomes immobilized, \\nresulting in progressive loss of hearing. \\nUsually both ears are affected. As well as \\nresulting in hearing loss, otosclerosis may \\nalso cause tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\\nIn many cases, hearing can be improved \\nthrough the use of a hearing aid. For \\nsevere cases, hearing can usually be \\nrestored by surgery to replace the stapes \\nwith an artificial substitute.\\nBAROTRAUMA\\nBarotrauma is damage or pain, mainly \\naffecting the middle ear, caused by changes \\nin pressure. Such changes are common \\nwhen flying or diving, and may cause minor \\ndamage to the middle ear, producing pain, a \\nfeeling of fullness in the ears, and tinnitus \\n(ringing in the ear). Symptoms usually clear \\nup by themselves within a few hours, but in \\nsevere cases the eardrums may be ruptured, \\nwhich requires medical attention.\\nOTITIS MEDIA\\nGlue ear\\nOtitis media is inflammation of the middle \\near, usually due to a bacterial or viral \\ninfection. It is more common in children, \\nbecause their Eustachian tubes (which \\nconnect the middle ear to the back of the \\nnose) are narrower and easily blocked, \\nallowing pus and fluid to accumulate  \\nin the middle ear rather than draining \\naway (which is then known as otitis  \\nmedia with effusion, or glue ear). \\nSometimes, the eardrum may rupture, \\ncausing a bloodstained discharge and a \\ndecrease in pain. Treatment for otitis \\nmedia is with medication to clear up the \\ninfection and relieve pain.\\nUS_174-179_Ear_and_eye_disorders_2.indd   174US_174-179_Ear_and_eye_disorders_2.indd   174 07/09/2021   15:3307/09/2021   15:33'),\n",

It may also be caused by \\npressure damage (barotrauma) or injury, \\nfor example, due to a blow or poking \\nsomething into the ear.\\nVERTIGO\\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo \\nPeople with vertigo have the sensation that \\nthey or their surroundings are spinning or \\ntilting, which produces unsteadiness and \\nsometimes nausea and vomiting. The \\nsymptoms are often worsened by sudden \\nhead movements. Vertigo can be brought \\non simply by spinning around or drinking \\ntoo much alcohol. In some people, it is \\ntriggered by heights, and it may occur as  \\na side effect of certain medications. \\nVertigo may also be a symptom of an \\ninner ear disorder, such as infection, \\nMénière’s disease (p.176), or benign \\nparoxysmal positional vertigo, in which  \\ntiny crystals that are normally embedded  \\nin gel in the inner ear become dislodged, \\ndisrupting the balance system. Other \\npossible causes include migraine, stroke,  \\na brain tumor or an acoustic neuroma \\n(p.176), or multiple sclerosis (p.171). \\nSymptoms may be alleviated by drugs  \\nto relieve nausea and vomiting.

The middle ear contains tiny bones that \\ntransmit sound from the eardrum to the inner  \\near. The inner ear contains the organs of hearing \\n(cochlea) and balance (semicircular canals).\\nEUSTACHIAN TUBE \\nDYSFUNCTION\\nThe Eustachian tube, running from the \\nmiddle ear to the back of the nose, acts  \\nas a drainage tube and also regulates \\npressure in the middle ear. In Eustachian \\ntube dysfunction, the tube is blocked or \\ninflamed, causing symptoms such as \\nimpaired hearing, a feeling of fullness in \\nthe ear, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and \\nsometimes dizziness. \\nMost commonly, Eustachian tube \\ndysfunction is due to a nose, sinus,  \\near, or throat infection, or from an  \\nallergy, such as hay fever.

Symptoms \\ninclude vertigo, nausea, vomiting, blurred \\nvision, impaired hearing, and tinnitus \\n(ringing in the ear). Viral labyrinthitis \\nusually clears up on its own within a few \\nweeks, but symptoms may be relieved with \\nmedication. Bacterial labyrinthitis usually \\nneeds treatment with antibiotics.\\nACOUSTIC NEUROMA\\nAn acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous \\ntumor of the acoustic nerve (also called \\nthe vestibulocochlear nerve), which carries \\nbalance and auditory signals from the ear \\nto the brain. Usually, only the nerve of one \\near is affected. In most cases, the cause is \\nunknown, although a minority are due to \\nthe genetic condition neurofibromatosis, \\nin which multiple tumors grow on nerves.\\nTINNITUS\\nTinnitus is the term for noises such as \\nbuzzing, ringing, or hissing that originate \\nwithin the ear rather than externally. It is \\ncommonly associated with hearing loss \\nand can also occur as a symptom of ear \\ndisorders, such as labyrinthitis, Ménière’s \\ndisease, otitis media (p.174), or earwax \\nblockage. It may also be caused by certain \\nmedications, such as aspirin. \\nTinnitus may improve if the underlying \\ncause can be treated. Otherwise, listening \\nto background sounds, using a tinnitus \\nmasker (a device that produces white \\nnoise), counseling, psychotherapy, or \\ntinnitus retraining (altering how the brain \\nresponds to tinnitus) may help.\\nMÉNIÈRE’S DISEASE\\nMénière’s disease is an inner ear disorder \\ncharacterized by recurrent attacks of \\nvertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and \\nhearing loss. It is due to a build-up of  \\nfluid in the labyrinth, which contains the \\norgans of balance and hearing. Usually, \\nonly one ear is affected, but both can \\nbecome involved. Attacks typically come \\non suddenly and may last from minutes  \\nto days before subsiding. \\nVESTIBULAR NEURITIS\\nAlso known as vestibular neuronitis, \\nvestibular neuritis is inflammation of  \\nthe vestibular nerve in the inner ear, \\nusually as a result of a bacterial or viral \\ninfection, such as the common cold or \\ninfluenza. The main symptoms are \\ndizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and \\nblurred vision. Viral vestibular neuritis \\nusually clears up by itself within a few \\nweeks, although medication may help to \\nrelieve symptoms such as nausea and \\nvomiting. Bacterial vestibular neuritis \\nusually needs treatment with antibiotics.\\nSymptoms include vertigo, nausea, \\nvomiting, tinnitus, impaired hearing, and  \\na feeling of pressure or pain in the ear. The \\ntime between attacks may vary from days \\nto years, and repeated attacks often lead \\nto progressive hearing loss or sometimes \\ntotal deafness.\\nTreatment is primarily with medication \\nto relieve symptoms, but in some cases \\ndrugs may be given to help reduce the \\nfrequency of attacks. If medication is \\nineffective, surgery may be an option.\\nNormal balance mechanism\\nWithin the bony labyrinth of the ears are the \\norgans of balance: the semicircular canals and \\nvestibule, which are filled with fluid. Movement  \\nof this fluid results in nerve signals being sent to \\nthe brain, which interprets the signals as motion.\\nBalance mechanism in Ménière’s disease\\nIn Ménière’s disease, there is a build-up of fluid  \\nin the vestibule, causing the chambers of the \\nvestibule to enlarge.

One or both \\neyes may be affected.\\nThere are two common types of \\nconjunctivitis: infective, caused by bacteria \\nor viruses; and allergic, which is an allergic \\nresponse to substances such as pollen or \\ncosmetics. Newborn babies sometimes \\ndevelop conjunctivitis as a result of \\ncatching an infection from the mother’s \\nPTERYGIUM  \\nA pterygium is a wing-shaped thickening \\nof the conjunctiva (the clear membrane \\ncovering the white of the eye) that starts \\non the side of the eye nearest the nose and \\nextends inward toward the center. One or \\nboth eyes may be affected. Pterygium is \\nthought to be due to prolonged exposure \\nto bright sunlight. If it causes discomfort  \\nor threatens vision, a pterygium may be \\nremoved surgically.\\nSUBCONJUNCTIVAL \\nHEMORRHAGE  \\nA subconjunctival hemorrhage is bleeding \\nunder the conjunctiva (the clear membrane \\ncovering the white of the eye), producing  \\na dark red area over the white of the eye. The \\ncondition often occurs spontaneously or \\nmay result from a minor eye injury, sneezing, \\ncoughing, or, rarely, a bleeding disorder such \\nas hemophilia. A subconjunctival \\nhemorrhage is usually painless and clears up \\nin a few weeks without treatment, but \\nmedical advice should be sought if it persists \\nor if the eye is painful.\\nTRACHOMA\\nTrachoma is an infectious eye disease \\ncaused by the bacterium Chlamydia \\ntrachomatis. Although rare in developed \\ncountries, it is a major cause of visual \\nimpairment and blindness worldwide. \\nThe infection is spread to the eyes by \\ncontact with contaminated hands or by \\nflies. Symptoms include a discharge from \\nthe eye and redness of the white of the \\neye. Repeated infections can scar the \\neyelids and make the eyelashes turn \\ninward so that they rub against the cornea, \\nleading to it becoming scarred and \\neventually resulting in blindness.\\nIn the early stages, trachoma can be \\ntreated with antibiotics. If the eyelashes have \\nturned inward, surgery may be needed to \\nstop them rubbing against the cornea. If \\nthe cornea has become scarred, treatment \\ninvolves corneal transplant surgery.\\nCATARACT\\nA cataract is cloudiness of the lens in the \\neye, causing blurred vision. Typically, \\ncataracts affect both eyes, but usually one \\neye is more severely affected. In most \\ncases, cataracts are a result of normal \\naging; most people over about 65 have \\nsome cataract formation. However, they \\nmay also sometimes be present from \\nbirth or may be due to factors such as  \\neye injury, certain eye diseases such as  \\nuveitis (inflammation of various internal \\neye structures), prolonged exposure to \\nsunlight, long-term corticosteroid \\ntreatment, or diabetes. Cataracts are  \\nalso common in people with Down \\nsyndrome. Smoking increases the risk  \\nof developing cataracts.\\nTypically, cataracts develop over months \\nor years. They cause only visual symptoms, \\nsuch as blurred vision, altered color vision, \\nand seeing haloes around bright lights. \\nTreatment is with surgery to remove the \\nnatural lens and, in most cases, replace it \\nwith an artificial one. This usually improves \\nvision significantly, although some people \\nstill need to wear glasses or contact lenses \\nafterward.\\nUVEITIS\\nUveitis is inflammation of any part of  \\nthe uvea, which comprises the iris (the \\ncolored part of the eye), ciliary body  \\n(a ring of muscle behind the iris), and \\nchoroid (the tissue layer that supports the \\nretina). In many cases, uveitis is thought  \\nto be due to an autoimmune disorder  \\n(in which the immune system attacks the \\nbody’s own tissues), such as Crohn’s disease \\n(p.203) or ankylosing spondylitis (p.158),  \\nvagina during birth. Infective conjunctivitis \\nis contagious and can be spread by \\nhand-to-eye contact.\\nBoth types of conjunctivitis produce \\nsimilar symptoms, but in infective \\nconjunctivitis, the discharge contains pus \\nand may cause the eyelids to stick together. \\nIn allergic conjunctivitis, the discharge is \\nclear and the eyelids are often swollen. \\nUsually, infective conjunctivitis clears  \\nup without treatment within about 2 \\nweeks, although if it is severe or persistent, \\nanti-infective medication may be prescribed. \\nAllergic conjunctivitis may be treated with \\nmedication to relieve symptoms.\\nor an infection, such as chicken pox (p.233), \\nshingles (p.233), or tuberculosis (p.236).  \\nIn some cases, there is no obvious cause. \\nSymptoms may include redness and \\nsoreness of the eye, blurred vision, small  \\nor irregularly shaped pupils, and sensitivity \\nto bright light. \\nTreatment with corticosteroids is usually \\neffective.

Treatment usually \\nprevents further visual loss but does not \\nrestore any vision already lost.\\nMACULAR DEGENERATION\\nMacular degeneration (also known as \\nage-related macular degeneration, or \\nAMD) is a deterioration of the macula,  \\nthe central area of the retina responsible \\nfor seeing detail. AMD tends to affect  \\nboth eyes and causes a roughly central, \\ncircular area of blindness that gradually \\nenlarges; peripheral vision is not affected.\\nThere are two forms of AMD. Dry AMD \\nChronic glaucoma\\nThe ciliary body continually produces fluid, which \\nusually flows out through the pupil and drains out \\nthrough the sievelike trabecular meshwork located \\nbetween the iris and the edge of the cornea. In \\nchronic glaucoma, the meshwork is blocked, and \\npressure builds up in the eye.\\nRETINAL BLOOD VESSEL \\nTHROMBOSIS\\nBlockage of a retinal artery by a thrombus \\n(blood clot) typically affects only one eye, \\ncausing sudden blindness or loss of part of \\nthe visual field. It requires urgent treatment, \\nwhich may include eye massage, draining \\nfluid from the eye, or medication; even  \\nwith treatment, loss of vision is usually \\npermanent. Blockage of a retinal vein also \\nusually affects only one eye and tends to \\ncause deterioration of vision over several \\ndays, although sometimes visual loss may \\noccur suddenly. Treatment may involve \\nmedication injected into the eye or laser \\nsurgery. Even with treatment, there is likely \\nto be some permanent loss of vision.\\nRETINAL DETACHMENT\\nVitreous detachment\\nIn retinal detachment, the retina separates \\nfrom the back of the eye. It may follow an \\neye injury, but usually occurs spontaneously. \\nTypically, only one eye is affected. Vitreous \\ndetachment is when the inside of the eye \\nseparates from the retina. \\nSymptoms of retinal detachment may \\ninclude flashing lights in the corner of the \\neye and large numbers of floaters, or a \\nblack area in the field of vision. Retinal \\ndetachment requires urgent treatment to \\nprevent blindness. Treatment may involve \\nlaser therapy, cryotherapy (freezing), or \\nsurgery and is usually successful, although \\nvision may not always be fully restored.\\nusually progresses over several months or \\neven years. There is no treatment, although \\na diet rich in green, leafy vegetables may \\npossibly slow its progression. Visual aids, \\nsuch as magnifying glasses, may also help \\nto make everyday tasks easier. Wet AMD \\ntends to progress more rapidly, sometimes \\ncausing visual deterioration within days. \\nThe condition’s progress may be slowed  \\nor halted by medication injected into the \\neye or by laser surgery.\\nCHALAZION\\nA chalazion is a round, red, usually painful \\nswelling in the upper or lower eyelid caused \\nby blockage of one of the meibomian \\nglands (oil-secreting glands that lubricate \\nthe eyelids). Chalazions are also known as \\nmeibomian cysts. They resemble styes but, \\nunlike styes, do not develop on the edges of \\nthe eyelids. Warm compresses can be used \\nto ease discomfort. Most chalazions \\ndisappear on their own within a few weeks. \\nSTRABISMUS\\nAlso known as lazy eye or squint, a \\nstrabismus is where the eyes point in \\ndifferent directions. This is common in \\nbabies, but usually disappears naturally \\nwithin a few months. A strabismus in later \\nchildhood is usually due to a breakdown in \\nthe mechanism for aligning the eyes. In \\nadults, a strabismus is usually due to an \\nunderlying disorder, such as a stroke (p.169). \\nStrabismus in children may be treated  \\nwith glasses, eye exercises, injections  \\ninto the eye muscles, or surgery. The \\ntreatment of strabismus in adults depends  \\non the cause.\\nBlocked trabecular \\nmeshwork \\nDrainage angle\\nSTYE (HORDEOLUM)\\nA stye is a small, pus-filled swelling at  \\nthe base of an eyelash, which may cause \\npain when blinking. It is usually due to a \\nbacterial infection. A stye typically begins \\nas a red lump on the edge of the eyelid. \\nThe eyelid then becomes red and swollen, \\nand a yellow spot may form at the center \\nof the stye. A stye usually ruptures, drains, \\nand heals within a few days with the \\napplication of warm compresses. One that \\npersists or worsens may be treated with \\nantibiotics.

The eyelid’s exposed inner \\nsurface becomes dry and sore, and the  \\neye may water continuously. Because  \\nthe eyelids cannot close fully, the cornea  \\nis exposed and vulnerable to damage or \\ninfection. Ectropion is usually due to aging, \\nbut may also be caused by damage to a \\nfacial nerve. Treatment is with surgery to \\ntighten the eyelid. \\nEntropion is a turning inward of the \\nupper or lower eyelid, or both. As a  \\nresult, the eyelashes rub against the \\ncornea, causing pain, irritation, and eye \\nwatering. Constant rubbing may scar  \\nthe cornea, leading to loss of vision. \\nEntropion is commonly due to aging,  \\nbut may also be due to the eye infection \\ntrachoma (p.177). It can usually be \\ncorrected with surgery.\\nBLEPHARITIS\\nBlepharitis is inflammation of the eyelids, \\ncausing redness and itchiness, greasy scales \\nat the lid margins, and crusts on the \\neyelashes. It may be associated with skin \\ndisorders such as seborrheic dermatitis \\n(p.222), or with bacterial infection or \\nallergy. Avoiding allergens, keeping the \\neyelids clean, and using an antidandruff \\nshampoo often results in blepharitis \\nclearing up by itself.

It is usually \\ncaused by coronary artery disease, in \\nwhich the coronary arteries that supply \\nblood to the heart are narrowed by fatty \\ndeposits. Other causes include coronary \\nartery spasm, in which the blood vessels \\nnarrow suddenly for a short period of \\ntime, heart valve problems, and heart \\nrhythm disorders. Severe anemia, which  \\nreduces the blood’s oxygen-carrying \\ncapacity, may also cause angina. \\nThe pain of angina usually starts in the \\ncenter of the chest but may spread to  \\nthe neck, back, and arms, or between the \\nshoulder blades. Typically, the pain is \\nbrought on by exertion and eases with rest. \\nIf the pain continues after rest, it may be \\ndue to a heart attack (opposite). \\nAngina can often be controlled with \\nmedication to open up blood vessels, but if \\nattacks become more severe or frequent, \\nangioplasty to widen or surgery to bypass \\nnarrowed arteries may be recommended.\\nHEART FAILURE\\nHeart failure is the term used when the \\nheart is unable to pump blood around the \\nbody effectively. It may develop quickly \\n(acute heart failure), often as a result of a \\nheart attack, or more gradually (chronic \\nheart failure) due to a long-term disorder \\nsuch as high blood pressure, coronary \\nartery disease, chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease, or heart valve or \\nrhythm problems. \\nHeart failure may be classified as left-  \\nor right-sided, according to the part of  \\nthe heart affected. In left-sided failure, \\nfluid builds up in the lungs, causing \\nbreathlessness. In right-sided failure, fluid \\nbuilds up in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and \\ntissues under the skin, causing swelling, \\nespecially of the legs and ankles.\\nTreatment varies according to the type, \\nseverity, and cause of the heart failure. It \\nmay include medication, surgery, an \\nimplanted device that regulates heart \\nrhythm, or a heart transplant.\\nHEART RHYTHM DISORDERS\\nAbnormalities of the heart rate or rhythm \\n(arrhythmias) are caused by disturbances in \\nthe electrical system that controls the \\nheartbeat. The heart has a natural pacemaker \\n(called the sinoatrial node) in the right \\natrium. This node sends electrical signals \\nthrough the atria (upper chambers) to \\nanother node (the atrioventricular node), \\nfrom where they pass to the ventricles \\n(lower chambers). The signals regulate the \\nheart muscle contractions and, therefore, \\nthe heart rate and rhythm. Poor signal \\nAtrial fibrillation\\nIf the sinoatrial node is overridden by random \\nelectrical activity in the atria, impulses pass through \\nthe atrioventricular node erratically, causing very \\nfast, irregular ventricular contractions.\\nSinus tachycardia\\nIn this condition, the heart rate of more than 100 \\nbeats/minute and a normal rhythm may simply be \\ndue to anxiety or exercise, but can also occur in \\nfever, anemia, and thyroid disease.\\nVentricular tachycardia\\nAbnormal electrical impulses in the ventricular \\nmuscle cause the ventricles to contract rapidly, \\noverriding the sinoatrial signal and producing  \\na fast, regular, but inefficient beat.\\nBundle-branch block\\nThe sinoatrial node impulses are partly or fully \\nblocked, slowing ventricular contractions.

If left untreated, the \\ninfection may spread into the blood and \\ncause septicemia (p.234), which may  \\nbe life-threatening.\\nLEUKEMIA \\nLeukemia is a group of cancers in which \\nthere is uncontrolled proliferation of \\nabnormal white blood cells in the bone \\nmarrow and reduced production of normal \\nblood cells. The cancerous white blood cells \\nare unable to fight infection; lack of red \\nblood cells leads to anemia; and reduced \\nlevels of platelets lead to excessive bruising \\nand bleeding.

A polyp is a small swelling that \\ndevelops on the membrane covering the \\nvocal cords. As it grows, the polyp may \\ndevelop a small stalk. A nodule is a small, \\ncalluslike lump on the vocal cords. \\nBoth polyps and nodules are usually \\ncaused by overuse of the voice, and both \\nproduce similar symptoms. Symptoms  \\ninclude hoarseness; a harsh, breathy  \\nvoice; and sometimes discomfort or  \\npain when speaking. \\nTreatment for vocal cord polyps and \\nnodules consists of resting the voice, \\nalthough sometimes surgery to remove  \\nthe growths may be advised. Tests to \\nconfirm that the growths are not \\ncancerous may also be carried out.\\nInflamed tonsils\\nIn tonsillitis, the tonsils at the back of  \\nthe throat become inflamed. They may  \\nalso have white, pus-filled spots on them,  \\nas shown above.\\nHERPANGINA\\nHerpangina is a throat infection caused  \\nby a specific group of viruses known as \\nenteroviruses, most commonly by \\ncoxsackieviruses—a group of viruses  \\nthat can cause a range of diseases, \\nincluding hand, foot, and mouth disease \\n(p.229), meningitis (inflammation of the \\nmembranes around the brain and spinal \\ncord, p.168), and pneumonia (p.194). The \\nviruses are usually spread by infected \\ndroplets coughed or sneezed into the  \\nair, and the viruses can survive on surfaces \\nfor several days. Herpangina is most \\ncommon in young children but can affect \\npeople of any age. \\nSymptoms of herpangina do not \\ntypically appear until 2–7 days after \\ninfection, when there is a sudden onset  \\nof fever, sore throat, and sometimes  \\nalso headache, abdominal discomfort,  \\nand muscle pain. Small blisters appear  \\nin the throat; they enlarge and then  \\nburst, forming ulcers. \\nThe infection usually clears up within \\nabout a week without specific treatment, \\nalthough symptoms of the infection may \\nbe relieved with medication.\\nPHARYNGITIS AND  \\nTONSILLITIS\\nViral sore throat  |  Bacterial tonsillitis\\nPharyngitis and tonsillitis are common \\ndisorders that are often described simply \\nas a sore throat. The pharynx connects  \\nthe back of the mouth and nose to the \\nlarynx (voice box) and esophagus (gullet). \\nThe tonsils lie at the top of the pharynx. \\nTonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils)  \\nis more common in children, because  \\nthey have large tonsils, which shrink  \\nwith age. Adults tend to get pharyngitis \\n(inflammation of the pharynx). However, \\nboth conditions can occur together in \\nadults and children.\\nPharyngitis and tonsillitis are usually \\ncaused by a viral infection, such as the \\ncommon cold or infectious mononucleosis, \\nbut the conditions may sometimes be  \\ndue to a bacterial or fungal infection.  \\nThe symptoms of both conditions are \\nsimilar and may include sore throat, \\ndifficulty swallowing, earache, and  \\nswollen lymph nodes in the neck. There \\nmay also be a fever. In severe cases,  \\nthere may be breathing difficulty, and \\noccasionally an abscess forms near a \\ntonsil, a condition called peritonsillar \\nabscess or quinsy. \\nTreatment for pharyngitis and tonsillitis \\nis usually with medication, although \\nsurgery may be needed for recurrent \\ntonsillitis or a peritonsillar abscess.\\nCROUP\\nIn croup (medically known as \\nlaryngotracheitis), the upper airways \\nbecome inflamed and narrowed, \\nproducing hoarseness, a harsh, grating \\nsound while breathing in (known as \\nstridor), a distinctive barking cough,  \\nand sometimes breathing difficulty. \\nCroup is most common in infants and \\nyoung children and is usually caused  \\nby a viral infection of the airways, although \\nit may also occur as a result of an allergy, \\ninhaling a small foreign body or an irritant \\nchemical, or epiglottitis (inflammation  \\nof the epiglottis, which is the flap of tissue \\nbehind the tongue that stops food from \\nentering the airways, p.191). \\nMild cases of croup may be treated  \\nwith medication.

Smokers, \\nyoung children, older people, and those \\nwith an existing lung disease are \\nparticularly susceptible to bronchitis. \\nSymptoms of acute bronchitis typically \\ndevelop over a day or two and include  \\na hacking cough that may bring up \\nphlegm, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \\nheadache, and mild fever. The cough may \\npersist for several weeks after the other \\nsymptoms have disappeared. \\nIn otherwise healthy people, acute \\nbronchitis usually clears up by itself in a \\nfew days; over-the-counter pain relievers \\nmay help to relieve symptoms. Medical \\nadvice should be sought if symptoms \\npersist or worsen, if other symptoms \\ndevelop, or if the person already has \\nanother health problem.\\nASTHMA\\nAsthma is a lung disorder in which there  \\nis intermittent inflammation and narrowing \\nof the airways in the lungs. People with \\nasthma have recurrent attacks when the \\nmuscles in the walls of the airways \\ncontract, causing narrowing. This is usually \\nin response to an allergen, such as pollen, \\nhouse dust mites, or pet dander (minute \\nscales from animal hair, feathers, and skin), \\nbut an attack may also be triggered by \\nfactors such as inhaled chemicals, irritants, \\nor dusts; certain medications; stress; \\nexercise; or respiratory infections. \\nAn asthma attack causes the sudden \\nonset of wheezing, shortness of breath, \\ntightness of the chest, and coughing.

Other factors that \\nmay increase the risk include a poor diet \\nand reduced immunity. \\nSymptoms may include an ulcer or  \\nsore that does not heal; a white or red \\npatch in the mouth that does not clear up; \\npersistent pain in the mouth; a swelling \\nthat develops anywhere inside the mouth \\nor on the lips; and pain when swallowing. \\nUntreated, oral cancer may spread to other \\nparts of the body.\\nTreatment for oral cancer is usually  \\nby surgical removal of the tumor, often \\nfollowed by radiation therapy. Cosmetic \\nsurgery may also be offered after removal \\nof the tumor to restore a more normal \\nfacial appearance. If the cancer has spread, \\ntreatment is usually with chemotherapy \\nand radiation therapy.\\nLEUKOPLAKIA\\nIn leukoplakia, there are small, thickened, \\nwhite patches in the mouth, usually on  \\nthe lining of the mouth or tongue, but \\nsometimes on the gums or floor of the \\nmouth. The main feature of the patches  \\nis that they cannot be scraped off. \\nLeukoplakia is linked to irritation from \\nsubstances such as tobacco, alcohol, and \\nbetel leaves or nuts, or from the tongue  \\nor cheek rubbing on a rough tooth or \\ndenture.

There may also be pain while \\neating. It is often possible to remove a \\nparotid (salivary gland) stone by surgery, \\nalthough in some cases the entire gland \\nmay need to be removed. \\nThe salivary glands can also become \\ninfected and inflamed. For example, the \\nparotid glands can become inflamed \\n(parotitis) due to infection with the  \\nMOUTH ULCER\\nAlso known as aphthous ulcers or canker \\nsores, mouth ulcers are painful open sores \\ninside the mouth. The exact cause of mouth \\nulcers is unknown, though a combination of \\nfactors may contribute, including minor \\nmouth injuries, vitamin deficiencies, and \\nstress. The ulcer forms a small, pale pit, and \\nthe area around it may become swollen.\\nMost ulcers clear up by themselves \\nwithin about 3 weeks. Symptoms may be \\nrelieved by over-the-counter antiseptic \\nmouthwashes, pain relievers, corticosteroid \\nlozenges, or anesthetic gels. A doctor  \\nor dentist should be consulted if an ulcer \\nlasts for more than about 3 weeks or \\nbecomes more painful or red, or if ulcers \\nkeep recurring.\\nUlcer inside lip\\nMouth ulcers are open sores on the inside of the \\nmouth.

Symptoms of gingivitis include \\nsoft, red, swollen gums that bleed easily \\nwhen brushing. \\nUntreated, the gums may recede and \\nthe teeth may become loose or even fall \\nout. Mild gingivitis can often be reversed \\nby good oral hygiene—brushing at least \\ntwice a day for about two minutes each \\ntime and flossing regularly. In more \\nadvanced cases, a dentist may have to \\nremove hardened plaque deposits. An \\nantiseptic mouthwash may help to  \\nprevent plaque from building up.\\nleukoplakia affects people with reduced \\nimmunity. In this type, the patches have  \\na rough surface. Leukoplakia is associated \\nwith an increased risk of mouth cancer,  \\nbut hairy leukoplakia is not. \\nStopping smoking and reducing alcohol \\nconsumption may cause the patches to \\nshrink or disappear.

Chronic \\nfailure develops more slowly and may \\nproduce jaundice, itching, abdominal \\nswelling due to fluid build-up, and, in men, \\nenlarged breasts and shrunken testes.\\nAcute liver failure requires immediate \\nhospital treatment; it is often ultimately \\nfatal without a liver transplant. Chronic \\nliver failure is treated with medication to \\nrelieve symptoms, as well as lifestyle \\nmeasures, such as a diet low in salt and \\nprotein and stopping alcohol consumption.\\nthere may be tiredness, nausea, loss of \\nappetite, weight loss, jaundice, swelling of \\nthe legs or abdomen due to the build-up of \\nfluid, vomiting of blood, a tendency to bleed \\nor bruise easily, itchy skin, and black, tarry \\nfeces.

They may include pain in the \\nupper abdomen that spreads out to the \\nback, loss of appetite, weight loss, \\njaundice, and itching. There may also \\nsometimes be indigestion, tiredness, \\nnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. \\nTreatment depends on the individual \\ncase but typically includes surgery, \\nradiation therapy, chemotherapy, and \\nmedication. The aim of treatment is to \\neradicate the cancer, but often this is not \\npossible, and treatment is focused on \\nrelieving symptoms and limiting the  \\nspread of the cancer.\\nPANCREATITIS\\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. \\nAcute (sudden-onset) pancreatitis may be \\ncaused by gallstones, alcohol abuse, an \\nabdominal injury, a viral infection, or \\ncertain medications. Chronic (long-term) \\npancreatitis is commonly due to long- \\nterm alcohol abuse; other causes include \\ncystic fibrosis (p.194) and hyperlipidemia \\n(high levels of fat in the blood).\\nSymptoms of both forms include severe \\nupper abdominal pain that may spread to \\nthe back; nausea; vomiting; and fever. In \\nsevere acute pancreatitis, the abdominal \\nlining may become inflamed (peritonitis, \\np.205). Chronic pancreatitis may lead to \\nmalabsorption or diabetes (p.219).\\nAcute pancreatitis usually requires \\nmonitoring and treatment in the hospital \\nuntil the inflammation clears up. Chronic \\npancreatitis is treated with pain relievers, \\npancreatic hormones, insulin, and \\nsometimes surgery. \\nGALLSTONES\\nGallstones are hard masses formed from \\nbile (a digestive juice produced by the \\nliver) that occur in the gallbladder or  \\nbile ducts (tubes that carry bile from the \\nliver to the gallbladder and intestines). \\nGallstones are more common in women, \\nthose who are overweight, people who  \\neat a high-fat diet, those over about  \\nthe age of 40, and people with certain \\ndisorders, such as cirrhosis (p.201)  \\nor Crohn’s disease. \\nGallstones take years to form and often \\ncause no symptoms unless they become \\nlodged in the cystic or common bile duct. If \\nthis happens, it can cause an attack of biliary \\ncolic: sudden, severe upper abdominal pain, \\noften with nausea and vomiting. Less \\ncommonly, there may be also be fever, \\npersistent pain, jaundice (p.201), and \\ndiarrhea.

The \\npouch is present at birth. It often causes no \\nproblems and does not need treatment. \\nSymptoms only occur if the pouch \\nbecomes obstructed, inflamed, or twisted. \\nThe most common symptom is painless \\nbleeding from the rectum. This bleeding \\nmay be sudden and severe; it requires \\ntreatment with an immediate blood \\ntransfusion. Inflammation may cause pain \\nin the lower abdomen. Occasionally, the \\ndiverticulum results in telescoping \\n(intussusception) or twisting (volvulus, \\np.204) of the small intestine. \\nInflammation, intussusception, and \\nvolvulus are treated by surgical removal  \\nof the affected part of the intestine.\\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME\\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a \\nlong-term condition in which there is \\nintermittent abdominal pain and \\nconstipation, diarrhea, or bouts of each in \\nthe absence of any diagnosed disease. The \\ncause is unknown, but it may result from \\nabnormal contractions of the intestines. \\nAn increased sensitivity to certain foods \\nmay also contribute. In some cases, IBS \\nmay be triggered by an episode of \\ngastroenteritis (p.196). Stress and anxiety \\ntend to worsen the condition. \\nSymptoms tend to come and go, but \\nattacks often recur for years. They vary widely \\namong individuals and with each episode. \\nSymptoms may include bloating and \\nexcessive gas (flatus); abdominal pain that \\nmay be relieved by defecation or passing gas \\n(flatus); diarrhea, constipation, or both; and \\npassing mucus during defecation.\\nIBS can often be controlled by self-help \\nmeasures, such as a change in diet, \\nexercising regularly, and relaxation \\ntechniques to reduce stress.

As a result, feces builds \\nup and blocks the bowel. The condition is \\npresent from birth. Symptoms, which are \\nusually apparent within weeks of birth, \\ninclude constipation, bloating, vomiting, \\npoor feeding, and failure to gain weight. \\nTreatment is with surgery to remove the \\naffected part of the bowel and then later \\nto rejoin healthy sections.\\nHard feces\\nIf feces are small, hard, and dry, the muscles in the \\nbowel wall must contract harder to push them \\nalong than if they are large and soft.\\nPouches form\\nPressure from pushing can cause diverticula  \\nto form at weak areas in the bowel wall.

Epididymal cysts often occur in \\nboth testes and are most common in \\nmiddle-aged and older men. The cysts are \\nusually painless and need no treatment. \\nOccasionally, an epididymal cyst may \\nbecome large and cause discomfort,  \\nor, very rarely, may become twisted  \\nand painful (a condition called torsion  \\nof an epididymal cyst), which is a medical \\nemergency and requires surgery. \\nEPIDIDYMO-ORCHITIS\\nEpididymitis  |  Orchitis\\nIn epididymo-orchitis, the epididymis  \\n(the coiled tube that runs along the back \\nof the testis and stores sperm, which  \\nthen pass to the vas deferens) and testis \\nbecome inflamed, causing pain and \\nswelling at the back of the testis and,  \\nin severe cases, swelling, redness,  \\nand extreme pain in the scrotum. It is  \\nusually one-sided. An inflammation that \\nonly affects the epididymis is called \\nBLADDER CANCER\\nMost cancerous growths in the bladder \\narise in the lining of the bladder wall, but \\nthey can also develop in muscle and other \\ncells in the bladder. Bladder tumors are \\nmore common in men and in people whose \\njobs involve exposure to carcinogens in \\nthe rubber, textile, and printing industries; \\nin smokers; and in those with persistent \\nirritation of the bladder from bladder stones \\nor the worm infestation schistosomiasis. \\nInitially, there may be no symptoms, but \\nover time there may be blood in the urine, \\ndifficulty passing urine, and weight loss. A \\nlarge tumor may cause urinary retention.\\nUntreated, the cancer may spread to \\nother parts of the body. Treatment may \\ninclude surgery, chemotherapy, radiation \\ntherapy, or a combination of these.\\nTESTICULAR TORSION\\nEach testis is suspended in the scrotum on \\na spermatic cord, which contains blood \\nvessels and the vas deferens (the tube that \\ncarries sperm from each testis). In \\ntesticular torsion, the testis rotates, causing \\nthe spermatic cord to become twisted. \\nThis restricts the blood supply to the testis \\nand causes pain. The condition usually \\naffects only one testis and sometimes \\noccurs after strenuous activity, but may \\ndevelop for no apparent reason. \\nSymptoms usually appear suddenly and, \\nas well as pain in the scrotum, may include \\nswelling of the testis, redness of the scrotum, \\nnausea, and vomiting. This is a medical \\nemergency and without prompt treatment, \\nthe testis may be permanently damaged. \\nTreatment is with surgery.\\nBLADDER STONE\\nBladder stones are hard lumps of minerals \\nthat gradually form inside the bladder, \\nusually as a result of incomplete emptying \\nof the bladder (urinary retention). They are \\nalso more likely to develop in people who \\nhave recurrent cystitis (inflammation of  \\nthe bladder) or certain disorders of body \\nchemistry, such as gout (p.159).

The cancer typically develops \\nslowly and often causes no symptoms in its \\nearly stages. Later, symptoms may include \\nvaginal bleeding; a watery, bloodstained, \\nand foul-smelling vaginal discharge; and \\npelvic pain. Untreated, the cancer may \\nspread to the uterus and other organs. \\nCervical cancer can be detected early by \\ncervical screening. Treatment is usually with \\nsurgery. Advanced cancer is usually treated \\nwith radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or \\nboth, although surgery may also be used. An \\nHPV vaccine is available to protect against \\nstrains of HPV associated with cervical cancer.\\nFIBROIDS\\nFibroids are slow-growing, noncancerous \\ngrowths in the uterus that consist of muscle \\nand fibrous tissue. Their cause is unknown, \\nalthough they are thought to be linked to \\nthe hormone estrogen, because they \\ndevelop mainly during the reproductive \\nyears and shrink after menopause.\\nSmall fibroids often do not cause \\nsymptoms. However, fibroids may grow \\nvery large and cause symptoms such as \\npainful, heavy periods; abdominal pain; \\nlower back pain; and frequent urination. \\nUntreated, they may lead to infertility or \\ncause problems during childbirth. \\nSmall, symptomless fibroids may not \\nneed treatment. Larger fibroids may be \\ntreated with medication to shrink them.  \\nIf medication proves ineffective, surgery \\nmay be recommended.\\nUTERINE POLYPS\\nUterine polyps are painless growths \\nattached to the inside of the uterus. They \\nmay occur singly or in groups, and typically \\nproduce bleeding between periods or after \\nmenopause, bleeding after intercourse, \\nand heavy periods. Polyps are usually \\nharmless, but they may occasionally \\nbecome cancerous. \\nThey may be removed by a minor \\nsurgical procedure called a hysteroscopy \\nand polypectomy. Polyps may sometimes \\nrecur, and further surgery may be required.\\nVULVODYNIA\\nVulvodynia is the medical term for persistent \\npain in the vulva (external female genitals) that \\nhas no apparent cause. The pain may be a \\nstinging, burning, or sore sensation, and may \\nbe triggered by touch. It may affect all or part \\nof the vulva, and may sometimes spread to \\nthe inner thighs or buttocks. This condition is \\nmore common in young women.\\nThere is no one treatment that works  \\nfor everybody. Treatments that may be \\nATROPHIC VAGINITIS\\nIn atrophic vaginitis, the lining of the \\nvagina becomes thin, fragile, and prone to \\ninflammation due to reduced levels of \\nestrogen hormones after menopause. As  \\na result, the vagina may be dry and itchy, \\nand there may be pain, discomfort, or \\nbleeding during sex. Other symptoms of \\natrophic vaginitis may include the need to \\npass urine more frequently and painful \\nurination. It is common after menopause. \\nThe condition may be treated with \\nhormone replacement therapy (HRT) or \\nestrogen-containing creams, pessaries,  \\nor vaginal tablets.\\nBACTERIAL VAGINOSIS\\nIn bacterial vaginosis, there is excessive \\ngrowth of some of the types of bacteria \\nthat normally live in the vagina. The cause \\nis unknown, but bacterial vaginosis is more \\ncommon in women who are sexually \\nactive. Bacterial vaginosis often causes  \\nno symptoms. However, some women \\nhave a grayish-white vaginal discharge \\nwith a fishy or musty smell and itching  \\nof the vagina or vulva. Seek medical advice \\nif the condition persists or if it occurs \\nduring pregnancy.\\nTreatment with antibiotics usually clears \\nup the problem, although it often recurs.\\nVAGINISMUS\\nVaginismus is spasm of the muscles around \\nthe entrance to the vagina, making sexual \\nintercourse painful and difficult, or \\nsometimes even impossible. The cause  \\nis usually psychological, although it may \\nalso sometimes result from certain physical \\ndisorders, such as inflammation of the \\nvagina due to infection.\\nIf vaginismus is due to a physical cause, \\ntreatment is of that cause. Vaginismus due \\nto a psychological problem is treated with \\npsychotherapy or sex therapy.\\nSites of fibroids\\nFibroids can occur in any part \\nof the wall of the uterus and  \\nare named according to their \\nsite—for example, in the cervix \\n(cervical fibroids) or in the \\ntissue layer in which they occur.\\nUterus\\nCervical \\nfibroid\\nIntramural \\nfibroid\\nSubserosal \\nfibroid\\nOvary\\nFallopian \\ntube\\nSubmucosal \\nfibroid\\ntried include avoiding scented soaps and \\npersonal hygiene products, and using an \\nanesthetic gel or vaginal lubricant.

It is usually due to bacteria entering \\nthe nipple during breast-feeding, but it \\nmay also be caused by changes in levels of \\nsex hormones—for example, the changes \\nthat occur at the start of puberty. \\nTypical symptoms include breast pain, \\ntenderness, and swelling in one or both \\nbreasts. Bacterial mastitis during breast-\\nfeeding may also cause redness and \\nengorgement, and may result in a breast \\nabscess (collection of pus). \\nMastitis due to infection may be treated \\nwith medication. Mastitis caused by \\nhormonal changes usually clears up in a \\nfew weeks without treatment.\\nBreast tumor\\nA mammogram is an X-ray of the breast that is \\nused to screen for breast cancer.

Discharge from the \\nnipple may occur naturally in early \\npregnancy, and a milky discharge may \\npersist once breast-feeding is over. A \\ndischarge in a woman who is not pregnant \\nor breast-feeding may be due to a hormone \\nimbalance or, rarely, a cyst under the areola. \\nA discharge containing pus indicates a \\nbreast abscess.

They \\ndo not usually require treatment, although \\nlarge lumps that cause discomfort may  \\nbe removed by surgery. Medical advice \\nshould be sought to exclude the possibility \\nof breast cancer.\\nECTOPIC PREGNANCY\\nIn an ectopic pregnancy, a fertilized egg \\nimplants itself outside the uterus, usually in \\na fallopian tube. Symptoms include severe \\npain in the lower abdomen and vaginal \\nbleeding. If the pregnancy continues, the \\ntube may rupture, causing internal bleeding \\nand shock; this may be life-threatening and \\nrequires emergency medical help. Most \\nectopic pregnancies are discovered early. \\nIn such cases, treatment may involve \\nmonitoring, as the egg may die naturally, \\nor, if that does not occur, treatment is with \\nmedication to end the pregnancy or \\nsurgery to remove the fertilized egg.\\nBREAST CYST\\nA breast cyst is a round, fluid-filled lump \\nthat forms within the milk-producing  \\ntissue of the breast. They are usually not \\ncancerous. Breast cysts can occur in women \\nof any age, but they most commonly affect \\nwomen between the ages of 35 and 50, \\nespecially those approaching menopause. \\nPostmenopausal women taking hormone \\nreplacement therapy can also develop \\nbreast cysts. Cysts may occur singly, but \\ntypically multiple cysts develop and both \\nbreasts may be affected. The cysts do not \\nusually cause pain. \\nMedical advice should be obtained to \\ncheck for the possibility of breast cancer. \\nTreatment is usually by draining the cysts.\\nPlacental abruption\\nIn most cases, the placenta becomes partly \\ndetached and blood either passes out through the \\nvagina or collects between the placenta and wall \\nof the uterus (as shown here). Rarely, the entire \\nplacenta may become detached.\\nPLACENTAL ABRUPTION\\nIn a placental abruption, the placenta \\nseparates from the wall of the uterus \\nbefore the baby is born. The cause is \\nusually unknown, but abruption is more \\ncommon in women with long-term high \\nblood pressure, those who have had an \\nabruption previously, and women who \\nhave had several pregnancies.

A small abruption is \\nusually treated with bed rest. In severe \\ncases, it may be necessary to induce labor \\nor carry out an emergency caesarean \\noperation. With treatment, the mother is \\nnot usually in danger, but there is a risk of \\nthe baby having health problems or dying.\\nPREMATURE LABOR\\nAlso known as preterm labor, premature \\nlabor is birth of a baby before the 37th week \\nof pregnancy. If labor occurs very early, the \\nbaby may have health problems or even die. \\nBecause of the risks to the baby, who may \\nbe born before his or her internal organs \\n(especially the lungs) are mature, medication \\nmay be used to delay labor long enough for \\ncorticosteroid drugs to be given to help the \\nbaby’s lungs mature.

Type 1 is an autoimmune \\ndisorder in which the immune system \\ndestroys insulin-producing cells in the \\npancreas. The underlying cause is \\nunknown, but it may be triggered by  \\na viral infection, and some people may  \\nalso have a genetic predisposition to \\ndeveloping it. In type 2 diabetes, the \\npancreas produces too little insulin or  \\nthe body cells are resistant to it. This type \\nis strongly linked to obesity; genetics may \\nalso play a role.

It may be caused by prolonged \\nexposure to ultraviolet light (in sunlight, for \\nexample) or chemical carcinogens, or \\ndevelop from solar keratoses. SCC \\ncommonly affects exposed areas of skin \\nbut may also affect the genitals. It starts as \\nan area of thickened skin and enlarges into \\na hard, painless lump resembling a wart. \\nUntreated, SCC may spread and be fatal. \\nIf detected early, SCC can often be \\ntreated with surgery to remove the cancer, \\nor sometimes with radiation therapy. In \\nadvanced cases, chemotherapy may also \\nbe necessary. With early treatment, most \\npeople are cured.\\nMALIGNANT MELANOMA\\nMalignant melanoma is a type of skin \\ncancer that arises from pigmented skin \\ncells called melanocytes. It is caused by \\nexcessive exposure to ultraviolet light (for \\nexample, in sunlight). Sunburn, in \\nparticular, significantly increases the risk. \\nThe most common symptom is the \\nappearance of a new mole or a change in \\nan existing one. Some melanomas appear \\nas fast-growing dark lumps; others as \\nirregular, flat, pigmented patches. Rarely, a \\nmelanoma has little or no color (known as \\namelanotic melanoma). Untreated, \\nmelanoma can spread rapidly. \\nMelanoma\\nMost melanomas have an irregular edge and  \\nare unevenly colored. Some take the form  \\nof flat patches (as here), whereas others are  \\nraised and lumpy.\\nTreatment depends on the site of the \\nmelanoma and how far it has spread. The \\nmain treatment is surgery to remove the \\ncancer, and maybe the surrounding lymph \\nnodes. Other treatments may include radiation \\ntherapy, chemotherapy, and sometimes other \\nmedications to destroy cancer cells or inhibit \\ntheir growth. With early treatment, most cases \\ncan be cured. Melanomas that have spread \\nwidely are often fatal.\\nUS_222-231_Skin_hair_and_nail_disorder.indd   226US_222-231_Skin_hair_and_nail_disorder.indd   226 07/09/2021   15:3407/09/2021   15:34'),\n",

Most colds clear up by themselves \\nwithin a week or two. Medical advice \\nshould be sought if a cold lasts for more \\nthan about three weeks, if symptoms \\nworsen, or if other symptoms develop. \\nOccasionally, a cold may be complicated  \\nby a bacterial infection, causing, for \\nexample, acute bronchitis (p.193),  \\nsinusitis (p.191), or a middle ear infection  \\n(otitis media, p.174). In such cases,  \\nmedical treatment is needed.\\nCoronavirus\\nA colored electron micrograph shows  \\nthe typical structure of a coronavirus, a  \\ngroup of viruses that includes COVID-19. \\nCoronaviruses are named for the crown-like \\nprotein spikes that protrude the core.\\nconditions, such as reduced immunity, \\ndiabetes, or respiratory disease. It typically \\ncauses severe breathing difficulty, which \\nmay be life-threatening and usually \\nrequires urgent hospital treatment.\\nThe virus is spread via tiny droplets  \\nfrom coughing or sneezing. Inhaling \\ninfected droplets or touching surfaces \\ncontaminated by the droplets and then \\ntouching the face can lead to infection. \\nWearing a facemask, physical distancing, \\nhandwashing, and avoiding touching the \\nface can reduce the risk of transmission. \\nTests can identify infected people, and \\nsurfaces and then touching the mouth or \\nnose. Seasonal flu and swine flu are spread \\nin these ways. Bird flu is usually caught \\ndirectly from infected birds.\\nAll types of flu produce similar symptoms, \\nincluding a fever, headache, coughing or \\nsneezing, exhaustion, aches, a stuffy or \\nrunny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea.  \\nFlu symptoms usually clear up within a few \\ndays without treatment, although tiredness \\nmay persist. Occasionally, the condition \\ncan cause serious illness or complications \\nsuch as pneumonia (p.194), and those at \\nparticular risk may sometimes be offered \\nantiviral medication.\\nA flu vaccine is available to reduce the \\nrisk of getting flu. The flu virus changes \\n(mutates) frequently, so it is necessary  \\nto be vaccinated each year against the  \\nstrains of virus prevalent at the time.\\nInfluenza virus\\nThis colored micrograph shows the structure  \\nof the influenza virus.

Treatment of \\nroundworm infestation is with anthelmintic \\nmedication to kill the worms.\\nTAPEWORM INFESTATION \\nTapeworms are ribbon-shaped parasitic \\nworms that can infest humans and animals. \\nInfestation usually occurs by eating \\nundercooked meat or fish that contains \\ntapeworm eggs or larvae, although it  \\nmay also occur by transferring worm  \\neggs from the fingers to the mouth. In  \\nthe intestine, the eggs and larvae mature \\ninto adult tapeworms. The adults produce \\nlarge numbers of eggs, which are passed \\nout in bowel movements and may be \\nvisible in the feces. \\nTapeworms from beef, pork, and  \\nfish usually cause only mild abdominal \\ndiscomfort or diarrhea. Rarely, fish \\ntapeworms may cause anemia (p.186). \\nHowever, ingesting pork tapeworm eggs \\nmay lead to the formation of cysts in  \\nbody tissues. This condition, called \\ncysticercosis, may cause symptoms such  \\nas muscle pain, seizures (fits), and \\nblindness. Tapeworm larvae acquired  \\nfrom dogs or sheep may rarely lead to \\nhydatid cysts in body organs. \\nTreatment of tapeworm infestation  \\nis with anthelmintic medication, which  \\nkills the worms.\\nPork tapeworm \\nThe adult pork tapeworm has suckers and  \\nhooks on its head, which it uses to attach  \\nitself to the wall of the intestine, where it may  \\ngrow to 20–30 ft (6–9 m) in length.\\nHYDATID CYST \\nHydatid cysts result from infestation with \\neggs of the tapeworm Echinococcus \\ngranulosus. The tapeworm is found mainly \\nin sheep and dogs and may be passed  \\nto humans by ingesting food or drink \\ncontaminated with infected sheep  \\nor dog feces. \\nIn humans, the eggs hatch into larvae  \\nin the intestine and migrate to the liver, \\nlungs, or other tissues, where they develop \\ninto cysts. The cysts grow slowly and often \\nproduce no symptoms. If symptoms  \\ndo develop, they vary according to the  \\nsite of the cyst. For example, a liver cyst \\nmay cause pain, nausea, and jaundice \\n(p.201); a lung cyst may cause chest pain \\nand a cough.\\nTreatment is with anthelmintic \\nmedication to kill the larvae and, in many \\ncases, surgery to remove the cysts.\\nTHRUSH \\nThrush (also called candidiasis) is an \\ninfection caused by the yeast Candida.  \\nThe yeast is normally present in the body \\nwithout causing problems, but sometimes it \\nmay multiply excessively and cause disease. \\nFactors that may lead to yeast overgrowth \\ninclude use of antibiotic medication or oral \\ncontraceptives, hormonal changes during \\npregnancy, disorders such as diabetes, and \\nreduced immunity. \\nSymptoms vary according to the area \\naffected. Skin infections typically cause an \\nitchy rash. Oral thrush produces sore, \\ncreamy-yellow patches in the mouth. \\nVaginal thrush causes itching of the vulva \\nand vagina, a thick, white discharge, and \\npain when urinating. In men, the penis may \\nbe affected, causing a rash and itching or \\nburning under the foreskin. Treatment is \\nwith antifungal medication to kill the yeast.\\nFLUKE INFESTATIONS \\nFlukes are flattened worms that may infest \\nhumans or animals. In humans, the two \\nmain diseases are liver fluke infestation \\n(fascioliasis) and schistosomiasis (also \\ncalled bilharzia). \\nFascioliasis is typically acquired by \\neating food contaminated with fluke \\nlarvae. In the body, the larvae invade the \\nliver, causing symptoms such as fever and \\nnight sweats. The larvae mature into adults \\nin the liver, where they may cause \\ninflammation or obstruction of the bile \\nducts, which may lead to jaundice.\\nSchistosomiasis is usually acquired by \\nbathing in water contaminated with fluke \\nlarvae. The larvae penetrate the skin and \\ndevelop into adults, which settle in veins  \\nof the bladder and intestines, causing \\ninflammation and sometimes bleeding and \\nulceration. Eggs produced by the adults may \\nmigrate to the liver and cause liver damage. \\nSymptoms of schistosomiasis include \\nitching where larvae penetrated the skin; \\nfever; muscle pain; diarrhea; frequent, \\npainful urination; blood in the urine; and  \\na cough. Treatment of both diseases is with \\nanthelmintic medication to kill the flukes.\\nUS_232-238_Infections_and_Infestations_revised.indd   238US_232-238_Infections_and_Infestations_revised.indd   238 07/09/2021   15:3407/09/2021   15:34'),\n",

Alcohol is \\nbroken down in the body by the liver,  \\nbut the liver can only break down a  \\nlimited amount at any given time. When \\nlarge amounts are drunk quickly, the \\nalcohol concentration in the body rapidly \\nrises to toxic levels. This can produce \\nsymptoms such as confusion, slurred \\nspeech, loss of coordination, vomiting, \\nirregular breathing, low body  \\ntemperature, and unconsciousness.  \\nThere is also a danger that the person  \\nmay choke on their own vomit. \\nSevere poisoning may cause seizures,  \\na heart attack (myocardial infarction),  \\nbrain damage, and breathing stoppage \\n(respiratory arrest), and may be life-\\nthreatening. Alcohol poisoning requires \\nurgent medical treatment.\\nDRUG OVERDOSE  \\nThe effects of a medication or drug \\noverdose vary, depending on factors such \\nas the specific drug and the amount taken. \\nThe symptoms may vary from mild to \\nsevere, and may develop very quickly or \\nover a number of days. Some common \\ngeneral symptoms include nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,  \\nchest pain, a rapid heartbeat, breathing \\nproblems, confusion, seizures, and \\nunconsciousness. A large overdose may  \\nbe life-threatening. As well as short-term \\neffects, overdose of some drugs may cause \\nlonger-term complications, such as liver  \\nor kidney damage. A drug overdose \\nrequires urgent medical treatment. To \\nensure treatment is as effective as possible, \\nit helps if medical staff know details such \\nas the drug taken, the amount taken, and \\nwhen it was taken.\\nFROSTNIP AND FROSTBITE \\nFrostnip and frostbite are injuries caused  \\nby freezing of the skin and underlying \\ntissues, most commonly the fingers, toes, \\nnose, and ears. \\nFrostnip causes the skin to turn pale, \\ncold, and numb; there may also be \\ntingling. Frostnip does not cause permanent \\ndamage, but it may develop into frostbite  \\nif exposure to cold continues. \\nIn frostbite, the affected area becomes \\nwhite, cold, and hard; it may then become \\nred and swollen. When rewarmed, mildly \\naffected tissues become red, swollen, and \\nsore. In more severe cases, blisters develop \\nand the area becomes very painful. Severe \\nfrostbite may lead to gangrene (tissue \\ndeath) or longer-term problems, such as \\npersistent pain or loss of sensation.\\nANIMAL BITES AND STINGS  \\nThe effects of a bite or sting vary, \\ndepending on whether the animal is \\nvenomous, whether it transmits disease, \\nand the amount of tissue damage. A  \\nminor, nonvenomous bite or sting typically \\ncauses only temporary pain and swelling. \\nHowever, medical attention should be \\nsought if symptoms are severe, do not \\nsubside, other symptoms develop, or  \\nthe animal may carry a disease such  \\nas malaria (p.237) or rabies (a viral \\ninfection that affects the nervous system). \\nSome people have a life-threatening \\nallergic reaction (called anaphylaxis),  \\nwhich requires urgent medical help.

There \\nmay also be avoidance of reminders of the \\nevent and refusal to talk about it, irritability, \\nand emotional numbness. PTSD may also \\nlead to problems such as depression or \\nalcohol or drug abuse. \\nIn some cases, PTSD clears up without \\ntreatment.

In generalized anxiety \\ndisorder, there are persistent psychological \\nsymptoms, such as a sense of foreboding \\nwith no apparent cause, being on edge, \\nimpaired concentration, repetitive \\nworrying thoughts, disturbed sleep, and \\nsometimes depression. The physical \\nsymptoms of generalized anxiety disorder \\nSTRESS\\nStress is a general term for the physical  \\nand psychological symptoms people \\nexperience when they feel overwhelmed. \\nIn stressful situations, levels of the hormones \\nepinephrine and hydrocortisone increase, \\nraising the heart rate and blood pressure \\nand altering the metabolism to improve \\nperformance. However, high levels of \\nthese hormones long-term can have  \\na negative effect, producing symptoms \\nsuch as headaches, sleeping problems, \\npalpitations, eating too much or too little, \\nirritability, difficulty concentrating and \\nmaking decisions, anxiety, and depression. \\nStress can often be managed by \\nself-help measures, such as relaxation \\ntechniques, regular exercise, and eating \\nhealthily.

They may include \\nbreathlessness, sweating, trembling, \\nnausea, palpitations, dizziness, fainting,  \\na feeling of choking, a sense of unreality, \\nand a fear that death may be imminent.\\nTreatment of anxiety disorders usually \\ninvolves psychotherapy (for example, \\ncognitive behavioral therapy) and \\nmedication to relieve symptoms, such  \\nas antidepressants or, in some cases, a \\nshort-term course of anti-anxiety drugs. \\nSelf-help measures, such as relaxation \\ntechniques, may also help to reduce \\nanxiety levels.\\nPHOBIAS\\nA phobia is a persistent, overwhelming \\nfear of a particular object, animal, activity, \\nor situation. Exposure to the object of  \\nthe phobia leads to intense anxiety \\naccompanied by symptoms such as \\ndizziness, palpitations, sweating, trembling, \\nand breathlessness.

They typically emerge in \\nadolescence and continue into adulthood.\\nPersonality disorders fall into three main \\ngroups. The first comprises paranoid, \\nschizoid, and schizotypal personalities. \\nPeople in this group have patterns of \\nbehavior and thinking that most would see \\nas eccentric or odd. The second group \\nconsists of antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, \\nor borderline personality types. This  \\ngroup is typified by emotional, impulsive, \\nattention-seeking, or self-centered \\nbehavior. The third group comprises \\navoidant, dependent, or obsessive-\\ncompulsive personalities. People in this \\ngroup have anxious, fearful, or inhibited \\npatterns of thinking and behavior. \\nTreatment usually involves psychotherapy \\nand support to help the person adapt his or \\nher behavior and function successfully. The \\noutlook is variable, although generally the \\nmanifestations of a dysfunctional \\npersonality diminish with age.\\nOBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE \\nDISORDER\\nCommonly known as OCD, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder is characterized by \\nuncontrollable, persistent thoughts \\n(obsessions) accompanied by irresistible \\nurges to carry out particular actions or \\nrituals (compulsions). \\nObsessions are unwanted thoughts, \\nimages, or feelings that enter the mind \\nrepeatedly and cause disturbing feelings of \\nanxiety or disgust. A person with OCD may \\nrecognize that the obsessions are irrational \\nbut is unable to ignore them.\\nCompulsions are repetitive behaviors or \\nmental acts that the person feels driven to \\nperform to relieve the disturbing feelings \\ncaused by the obsession. The compulsive \\nacts (repetitive handwashing, for example) \\nmay have to be carried out so many times \\nthat they seriously disrupt normal life. \\nMild OCD can often be successfully \\ntreated with psychotherapy. In more \\nsevere cases, psychotherapy and \\nantidepressant medication may be used. \\nMost people improve within about a year \\nof starting treatment, but for a minority \\nOCD may persist long-term.\\nADHD\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder \\n(ADHD) is a behavioral problem in \\nchildren in which there is a consistently \\nhigh level of activity, impulsiveness, and \\ndifficulty attending to tasks. The cause  \\nis unknown, although the disorder tends  \\nto run in families, so a genetic factor may \\nbe involved. \\nSymptoms usually develop between \\nabout the ages of 3 and 7 years. They may \\ninclude a short attention span; an inability \\nto finish tasks; difficulty in following \\ninstructions; a tendency to talk excessively \\nand interrupt others; difficulty waiting or \\ntaking turns; constant fidgeting; an inability \\nto play quietly alone; and frequently acting \\nwithout thinking. \\nTreatment may be with therapy, \\nmedication, or both. Therapy may involve \\npsychotherapy and social skills training, as \\nwell as training and education for parents. \\nMedications can help to control the \\nsymptoms—for example, by aiding \\nconcentration and reducing impulsiveness. \\nSymptoms of ADHD usually diminish with \\ntime, although the condition may \\nsometimes persist into adulthood.\\nDEPRESSION\\nPostnatal depression  |  Seasonal affective \\ndisorder (SAD)      \\nDepression is characterized by persistent \\nfeelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss \\nof interest in life. A number of factors may \\ntrigger it, including a stressful life event, \\nsuch as a bereavement; physical illness  \\nor mental health problems; hormonal \\nchanges after childbirth (postnatal \\ndepression); certain medications; or \\nalcohol or drug abuse. Some people \\nbecome depressed only during winter \\nmonths, a condition known as seasonal \\naffective disorder (SAD). Depression may \\nalso sometimes run in families.\\nDepression can cause a wide variety of \\nsymptoms, and they may vary in severity \\nfrom person to person. Common symptoms \\ninclude a feeling of sadness, loss of interest \\nin and enjoyment of work and leisure \\nBrain areas and depression\\nDepression may involve the amygdala and \\nhippocampus, which produce emotional \\nresponses, and the prefrontal cortex, which \\ngenerates thoughts about those emotions.\\nactivities, low energy, anxiety, irritability, and \\nlow self-esteem.

They include \\nphysical tics, such as facial twitches, \\nblinking, mouth movements, and head \\nand foot movements; and vocal tics, such \\nas coughing, throat clearing, snorting, and \\ngrunting. In some cases, the person may \\nrepeatedly utter obscenities, copy what \\nother people say or do, say the same thing \\nrepeatedly, or make complex physical \\nmovements (such as jumping or hitting \\nthemselves or others).\\nTreatment is usually with psychotherapy. \\nMedication to control the tics may also be \\nused. For most people, the condition is \\nlifelong, although the symptoms tend to \\nbecome less severe with age and may \\neventually disappear completely.\\nSUBSTANCE MISUSE\\nAlcohol/drug misuse      \\nSubstance misuse is the harmful use of \\nalcohol, drugs (including prescription and \\nover-the-counter medications), or other \\nchemicals, such as inhalants. \\nCommonly misused substances include \\nalcohol, cannabis, heroin, cocaine, \\namphetamines, benzodiazepines, \\nhallucinogens, and various “designer \\ndrugs.” Usually, they are used to cause \\nintoxication or alter mood. However, \\nexcessive amounts can be dangerous in \\nthe short term. For example, drinking large \\namounts of alcohol in a short period may \\ncause confusion, loss of memory, or, in \\nextreme cases, death. Similarly, a drug \\noverdose may be fatal. In the longer term, \\nregular use of a substance may lead to \\ntolerance (in which increasing amounts are \\nneeded to achieve the desired effect) and \\naddiction. It may also cause organ damage; \\nmental health problems; and disruption of \\nfamily, social, and work life.\\nAcid-worn teeth in bulimia\\nRecurrent vomiting in bulimia causes the teeth  \\nto be exposed repeatedly to stomach acid. This \\nwears away the enamel covering the teeth and \\nmay eventually lead to tooth decay.\\nEATING DISORDERS\\nAnorexia nervosa      \\nEating disorders are characterized by an \\nabnormal attitude to food, resulting in \\navoiding food (anorexia), self-induced \\nvomiting (bulimia), or compulsive \\novereating (binge eating disorder).  \\nPeople with anorexia believe themselves \\nto be fat even when they are underweight. \\nAs well as severely restricting calorie \\nintake, affected people may exercise \\nexcessively, use appetite suppressants or \\nlaxatives, or make themselves vomit after \\neating. Menstrual periods may stop; fine, \\ndowny hair grows on the body; and the \\nbody muscles waste away. Eventually, \\nanorexia can be life-threatening. \\nIn bulimia, the person binge eats, then \\ndeliberately vomits or uses laxatives to \\navoid weight gain. Vomiting may cause \\nchemical imbalances in the blood, which \\nmay lead to irregular heart rhythms. \\nIn binge eating disorder, the person feels \\ncompelled to eat large amounts in a short \\nperiod, even when he or she is not hungry, \\nwhich often leads to obesity.\\nTreatment of an eating disorder usually \\ninvolves psychotherapy and nutritional \\nguidance; antidepressants may also be \\nprescribed. Recovery may take a long time, \\nsometimes years.\\nOnline gambling\\nCompulsive gambling can jeopardize many \\naspects of a person’s social, work, and family  \\nlife, as well as causing financial problems. The \\navailability of online gambling may make it  \\nharder for a person addicted to gambling to stop. \\nADDICTIONS\\nAn addiction is a state of being so \\ndependent on something that it is difficult \\nor impossible to do without it for any \\nsignificant period. It is possible to become \\naddicted to anything, but whatever the \\naddiction is, the person cannot control it. \\nSome symptoms are specific to the \\naddictive substance or activity, but there \\nare general features that occur in all \\naddictions. These include the development \\nof tolerance—the need for increasing \\namounts to produce the desired effect; \\nunpleasant physical and psychological \\nsymptoms when the substance or activity \\nis stopped; and continuing to use the \\nsubstance or engage in the activity even \\nthough it may be detrimental. \\nTreatment of addictions depends on the \\nspecific substance or activity involved.

But only one form of exercise,\\neccentric exercise, if we are unaccustomed to it, leaves us\\nstiff and sore the next day. During eccentric exercise the\\ncontracting muscle is forcibly lengthened. One commonly\\nencountered example of eccentric exercise is downhill\\nwalking. As we step down the slope, the contracting\\nquadriceps muscle controls the rate of knee flexion\\nagainst the force of gravity and in the process the muscle\\nundergoes an eccentric contraction with each step.\\nImmediately after the exercise there is no pain. This sets\\nin several hours later and peaks at about 48 h. It is\\nthought to result from muscle damage produced by the\\neccentric exercise. \\nAn interesting and important feature is the adaptation\\nprocess. A second bout of eccentric exercise, a week after\\nthe first, leaves us much less stiff and sore. The ability of\\nmuscle to rapidly adapt to the damage from eccentric\\nexercise, to prevent further damage, provides the\\nopportunity for a number of clinical applications.\\nThe subject of eccentric exercise and its mechanism has\\nbeen discussed previously in a number of reviews\\n(Armstrong et al. 1991; McHugh et al. 1999; Morgan &\\nAllen, 1999; Warren et al. 2001; Allen, 2001). Brief\\nperusal of the literature indicates that the subject is of\\ngrowing interest. The aim in this review is to focus\\nattention particularly on some of the indicators of the\\ndamage from unaccustomed eccentric exercise and their\\npossible mechanisms. The discussion will consider how\\nsuch indicators might be used to assess the degree of\\nprotection available to an individual in the event of\\nexposure to further eccentric exercise and how this kind\\nof knowledge might be useful in the clinic. \\nInitial event\\nIt is generally agreed that there are two prominent signs\\nof damage in a muscle immediately after it has been\\nsubjected to a series of eccentric contractions. There are\\nthe presence of disrupted sarcomeres in myofibrils and\\ndamage to the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling\\nsystem. It remains a point of controversy which of these\\ntwo represents the primary event. The view taken here\\n(see also Morgan & Allen, 1999) is that the damage process\\nbegins with overstretch of sarcomeres (Fig. 1). The\\nalternative view is that the starting point is damage to\\ncomponents of the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling\\nprocess. In a recent review, Warren et al. (2001)\\nsummarised their position by declaring that 75% or more\\nof the decline in tension after eccentric exercise was\\nattributable to a failure of the E–C coupling process.

While concentric contractions initiate movements, eccentric contractions slow or stop\\nthem. A unique feature of eccentric exercise is that untrained subjects become stiff and sore the\\nday afterwards because of damage to muscle fibres. This review considers two possible initial\\nevents as responsible for the subsequent damage, damage to the excitation–contraction\\ncoupling system and disruption at the level of the sarcomeres. Other changes seen after\\neccentric exercise, a fall in active tension, shift in optimum length for active tension, and rise\\nin passive tension, are seen, on balance, to favour sarcomere disruption as the starting point for\\nthe damage. As well as damage to muscle fibres there is evidence of disturbance of muscle sense\\norgans and of proprioception. A second period of exercise, a week after the first, produces much\\nless damage. This is the result of an adaptation process. One proposed mechanism for the\\nadaptation is an increase in sarcomere number in muscle fibres. This leads to a secondary shift\\nin the muscle’s optimum length for active tension. The ability of muscle to rapidly adapt\\nfollowing the damage from eccentric exercise raises the possibility of clinical applications of\\nmild eccentric exercise, such as for protecting a muscle against more major injuries. \\nJournal of Physiology(2001), 537.2, pp.333–34513112 333'),\n",

So the suggestion is that most of the primary\\ndamage arises in the E–C coupling system and only a\\nsmall component occurs at the level of the sarcomeres.\\nSupporting evidence comes from the observation that in\\nmouse muscle the post-exercise deficit in tension can be\\nrecovered with caffeine (Warren et al. 1993; Balnave &\\nAllen, 1995). In the first of these studies, tension was\\nrecovered with 50 mM caffeine, which releases Ca2+ from\\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum and leads to development of a\\ncontracture in the muscle. In the second, 10 mM caffeine\\nwas used to potentiate tension in single fibres in response\\nto direct electrical stimulation. It was concluded that in\\nmouse fibres changes in E–C coupling may be a major\\ncontributor to the observed fall in tension after eccentric\\ncontractions (Allen, 2001).\\nHowever all of this still leaves open the question of what\\ncomes first, E–C coupling failure or sarcomere disruption.\\nWith respect to the effects of potentiators, there does\\nseem to be a species difference. In single frog fibres\\n(Morgan et al. 1996) and in toad muscle (Talbot, 1997;\\nAllen, 2001) the fall in tension could not be recovered by\\npotentiating Ca\\n2+ release. \\nThere is a specific hypothesis for the process of sarcomere\\ndisruption (Fig. 1). It has been known for some time that\\nthe descending limb of the sarcomere length–tension\\ncurve is a region where sarcomere inhomogeneities\\ndevelop (Gordon et al. 1966). It has been proposed by\\nMorgan (1990) that during active stretch of a muscle,\\nmost of the length change will be taken up by the weakest\\nsarcomeres in myofibrils or, more strictly speaking, the\\nweakest half-sarcomeres. On the descending limb of the\\nlength–tension curve, these sarcomeres will become\\nprogressively weaker and when they reach their yield\\npoint, they will lengthen rapidly, uncontrollably, to a\\npoint of no myofilament overlap, where tension in\\npassive structures balances the active tension in adjacent\\nsarcomeres that still have myofilament overlap. This\\nprocess is repeated iteratively, with the next-weakest\\nsarcomere stretching, and so on. It is postulated that\\noverstretched sarcomeres are distributed at random along\\nmuscle fibres. At the end of the stretch, when the muscle\\nrelaxes, myofilaments in the majority of overstretched\\nsarcomeres re-interdigitate so that they are able to\\nresume their normal function. A few may fail to do so and\\nbecome disrupted (Talbot & Morgan, 1996). During\\nrepeated eccentric contractions it is postulated that the\\nnumber of disrupted sarcomeres grows, until a point is\\nU. Proske and D. L. Morgan334 J. Physiol.537.2\\nFigure 1. Postulated series of events leading to muscle damage from eccentric exercise\\nDuring an active lengthening, longer, weaker sarcomeres are stretched onto the descending limb of their\\nlength–tension relation where they lengthen rapidly, uncontrollably, until they are beyond myofilament\\noverlap and tension in passive structures has halted further lengthening. Repeated overextension of\\nsarcomeres leads to their disruption. Muscle fibres with disrupted sarcomeres in series with still-\\nfunctioning sarcomeres show a shift in optimum length for tension in the direction of longer muscle\\nlengths. When the region of disruption is large enough it leads to membrane damage. This could be\\nenvisaged as a two-stage process, beginning with tearing of t-tubules. Any fall in tension at this point\\nwould be reversible with caffeine (see text). It would be followed by damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum,\\nuncontrolled Ca2+ release from its stores and triggering of a local injury contracture. That, in turn, would\\nraise muscle passive tension. If the damage was extensive enough, parts of the fibre, or the whole fibre,\\nwould die. This fall in tension would not be recoverable with caffeine. Breakdown products of dead and\\ndying cells would lead to a local inflammatory response associated with tissue oedema and soreness.\\n'),\n",

It is at this\\npoint that damage to elements of the E–C coupling\\nmachinery becomes apparent. Subsequently the fibre\\nmay die (Fig. 1). \\nIt is conceptually more difficult to envisage damage\\nto the E–C coupling process as the primary event.\\nObservations by Takekura et al. (2001) of abnormal\\nt-tubular arrangements after eccentric exercise could\\nprovide the basis for such a hypothesis. Here the first step\\nin the damage process would be t-tubule rupture. Torn\\ntubule ends would then seal off leading to inactivation of\\nsome sarcomeres. If such sarcomeres were concentrated in\\nparticular myofibrils it could lead to a fall in tension. This\\ntension would be recoverable by a caffeine contracture\\nbut not by potentiators. If inactivated sarcomeres were\\nscattered at random amongst myofibrils, the situation\\nwould be very similar to that where the primary event\\nwas sarcomere disruption. That is, ultrastructurally, a\\nnon-uniform sarcomere length distribution would be\\nobserved and mechanically, a shift in optimum length for\\nactive tension would occur, in the direction of longer\\nmuscle lengths. The main difficulty with such a\\nhypothesis is trying to account for why t-tubules should\\nbe the primary site for damage and why this only occurs\\nat lengths beyond the optimum. The reverse sequence,\\nbeginning with sarcomere disruptions and leading to\\nt-tubule damage, could, of course, account equally readily\\nfor the observations of Takekura et al. (2001). \\nStructural signs\\nIt is no longer a matter of controversy that eccentric\\nexercise leads to structural signs of muscle damage\\n(Friden et al. 1981; Newham et al. 1983). Most of the\\nevidence comes from electron microscopic examinations\\nand these show sarcomeres out of register with one\\nanother, Z-line streaming, regions of overextended\\nsarcomeres or half-sarcomeres, regional disorganisation of\\nthe myofilaments and t-tubule damage; for a review see\\nMorgan & Allen (1999).\\nThe precise details of the sarcomere disruption process\\nfollowing eccentric contractions remain the subject of\\nspeculation. They may involve the elastic filament titin,\\nwhich anchors thick filaments to Z discs, or the structural\\nprotein desmin, which links adjacent Z discs (Allen, 2001).\\nIt is conceivable that because of small alignment errors,\\nthick and thin filaments of overstretched sarcomeres may\\nbutt up against one another. Inactivation of some\\nsarcomeres from damage to t-tubules may also play a\\npart. Whatever the precise details, there is evidence of\\noverextended sarcomeres and half-sarcomeres in muscle\\nwhich has undergone eccentric contractions (see, for\\nexample, Brown & Hill, 1991; Lieber et al.1991; Wood et\\nal. 1993; Talbot & Morgan, 1996).

The numbers indicate the distribution of tension.\\nTotal tension is set at 80% of maximum to indicate that the\\nsarcomere is on the descending limb of its length–tension\\nrelation. When one half-sarcomere becomes over-stretched, as\\na result of an eccentric contraction, tension borne by its\\nmyofilaments drops to zero and the full tension is borne by\\nthe elastic filament. The other half-sarcomere is unaffected\\nsince its isometric tension capability remains the same. When\\na second elastic element is included in the model, one which\\nspans the full length of the sarcomere (lower 3 diagrams),\\noverstretch of one half-sarcomere leads 50% of the tension to\\nbe distributed to the elastic element in series with the thick\\nfilaments while, because of its proportionately smaller\\nextension, that spanning the sarcomere bears less (30%). It\\nwill also contribute 30% of the tension to the other half-\\nsarcomere, the remaining 50% being distributed between the\\nseries elastic element (5%) and the cross-bridges (45%). Since\\nthis half-sarcomere’s isometric tension capability remains at\\n70%, it shortens until tension in the series element has fallen\\nto zero and myofilament overlap is somewhere on the\\nascending limb, generating 60% of the tension, leaving 20%\\nin the elastic element spanning the sarcomere. This is what is\\nobserved under the electron microscope, one half-sarcomere\\nover-stretched to beyond overlap, the other half very short.\\nThis kind of model indicates that passive tension in the whole\\nsarcomere becomes significant when one half becomes over-\\nstretched. \\n'),\n",

When the muscle relaxed,\\nsome overextended sarcomeres did not re-interdigitate\\n(Talbot & Morgan, 1996) and this meant that neighbouring\\nsarcomeres returned to a shorter length than before the\\ncontractions. The muscle would therefore have to be\\nstretched further before passive tension in these shorter\\nsarcomeres rose to measurable levels.\\nDecline in tension\\nAn important indicator of damage after a period of\\neccentric exercise is the drop in active tension. This may\\nbe as much as 60%, but here it must be remembered that\\nthe tension decline will include a component of metabolic\\nfatigue that is common to all forms of exercise, not just\\neccentric exercise. It has been suggested that any\\nestimate of the decline in tension from eccentric exercise\\nshould use as a control a comparable period of concentric\\nexercise, but which took into account the difference in\\nenergetic cost of concentric and eccentric contractions\\n(Allen, 2001).\\nThe disruption of sarcomeres lying in series with still\\nfunctioning sarcomeres, by itself, would not be expected\\nto produce a fall in tension, provided fibre length was\\nadjusted to the new, longer optimum length. But as the\\ndamage spread across the myofibril, and to other\\nmyofibrils, membranous structures would become\\ninvolved, leading to damage and impairment of the E–C\\ncoupling process. Any tension decline at this point would\\nbe recoverable with a caffeine contracture. Subsequently\\na point would be reached where part of the fibre, or the\\nwhole fibre died. Consistent with such a two-stage process\\nis the report of a secondary, delayed fall in tension (Jones\\net al.1989; Faulkner et al.1993; MacIntyre et al.1995). In\\nhuman subjects it was observed that the initial fall in\\ntension after eccentric exercise was followed by a slow\\nrise over 2–4 h, presumably recovery from metabolic\\nexhaustion. Then 24 h later there was a second fall in\\ntension (MacIntyre et al.1995). It may be that here some\\nfibres die, so that this component of a fall in tension\\nwould not be expected to be recoverable with caffeine\\n(Fig. 1).\\nWhen making measurements of the decline in tension\\nafter eccentric exercise, it is not only important to\\nconsider any effects of metabolic fatigue but the\\nconsequences of a shift in optimum length for active\\ntension. The optimum length before the exercise will be\\nshort of the optimum length after the exercise because of\\nthe shift and so risks leading to an underestimate of the\\nremaining tension. It is also likely to contribute to the\\nobserved change in the force–frequency relationship\\n(Newham et al.1983). \\nDifferent fibre types\\nMany studies have considered the susceptibility of\\ndifferent muscles and parts of muscles to damage from\\neccentric contractions. A question that has been raised\\nrepeatedly concerns the vulnerability of different types\\nof motor units in muscles of mixed, slow–fast fibre\\ncomposition. Claims have been made for a predisposition\\nto damage in slow units during locomotion (Armstrong et\\nal. 1983; Mair et al. 1992). The reasons put forward\\ninclude the low recruitment threshold and important\\npostural roles of these motor units. When muscles of\\nmixed, slow–fast fibre composition were subjected to\\nmaximal active lengthenings, the large, fast-fatiguable\\nmotor units were more vulnerable, it was suggested,\\nbecause of their lack of oxidative capacity (Friden &\\nLieber, 1998), or the higher tensions generated by them\\n(Appell et al.1992). In another recent study demonstrating\\npreferential fast-oxidative-glycolytic fibre damage, it\\nwas suggested that fibre phenotype or lower contractile\\nworkload might be responsible (Vijayan et al. 2001).\\nOthers have suggested a combination of factors involving\\nboth active and passive properties of muscle fibres\\n(Macpherson et al. 1996). In a recent review, Lieber &\\nFriden (1999) proposed that the larger amount of fibre\\ninjury in fast-glycolytic fibres after eccentric exercise was\\na result of the ‘increased strain and injury due to their\\nshort fibre length’.\\nAn important feature of the sarcomere non-uniformity\\nhypothesis is the dependence of damage on the length\\nrange over which eccentric contractions are carried out. It\\nraises the possibility that optimum lengths for different\\nfibre types may not be the same so that in a muscle of\\nmixed composition, stretch of the whole muscle leads\\nsome fibres to be stretched further down the descending\\nlimb of their length–tension curve than others. In a recent\\nstudy from our laboratory (J. Talbot, M. Homewood &\\nD.L. Morgan, unpublished observation), the predominantly\\nfast-twitch, tibialis anterior muscles and slow-twitch\\nsoleus muscles of rats were subjected to a series of\\neccentric contractions. The applied active stretches were\\ncarefully arranged to cover the same portion of each\\nmuscle’s length–tension relation. Shifts in optimum\\nlength for active tension were observed in both muscles,\\nindicating that the contractions had produced damage in\\nboth fibre types. The size of the shift was not\\nsignificantly different between the two muscles. The\\nresult suggested that fibre-type composition, as such, was\\nnot a determinant of the amount of damage from\\neccentric contractions, provided the contractions covered\\nan equivalent range of muscle lengths.\\nHowever, it still remained to explain the reports of others\\nconcerning susceptibility to damage of fibres within the\\nsame muscle, of mixed fibre composition. In a second\\nexperiment (Brockett et al. 2001b), slow-twitch and\\nfast-twitch motor units were studied in the medial\\ngastrocnemius muscle of the cat. It was found that the\\nU. Proske and D. L.

For human elbow flexors this is indicated by the\\nrelaxed arm adopting a slightly flexed posture (Jones et\\nal.1987). When muscle stiffness was measured, this more\\nthan doubled after the exercise and remained elevated for\\nthe next 4 days (Howell et al.1993). The immediate rise in\\nstiffness post-exercise was postulated to result from\\nstretch-activated Ca\\n2+ release (Howell et al. 1993). Other\\nexplanations have been based on shortening of parallel,\\nnon-contractile elements in the muscle (Howell et al.\\n1985; Jones et al. 1987). The scheme shown in Fig. 1 has\\npassive tension rising from development of a local\\ncontracture in fibre segments, following a rise in\\nmyoplasmic Ca2+, as a result of membrane damage. \\nSeveral studies have demonstrated increases in resting\\nCa2+ levels in muscle fibres damaged by eccentric\\ncontractions (Balnave & Allen, 1995; Balnave et al. 1997;\\nIngalls et al. 1998). However, within the limits of\\nresolution of the method, measurements showed that the\\nrises in Ca2+ levels were uniformly distributed along\\nmuscle fibres (Balnave et al. 1997). Perhaps the rise in\\nCa2+ is sufficient to trigger a low level of activation to\\nincrease passive tension, although there is no direct\\nevidence for this (Whitehead et al.2001, p. 602).\\nWhen measured across the full physiological range, the\\nrise in passive tension after a series of eccentric\\ncontractions peaks at a length close to the optimum for\\nactive tension (Whitehead et al. 2001). Measurements of\\nwork absorption by the passive muscle in response to\\nlarge, slow lengthening and shortening movements\\nshowed a significant rise after the eccentric contractions.\\nIt was suggested that the increase in work absorption was\\na result of actively cycling cross-bridges in the damaged\\nsegments of muscle fibres (Whitehead et al. 2001). There\\nis some structural evidence for contracted fibre segments\\nin muscle damaged by eccentric exercise. Thus, it was\\nfound that after downhill running, fibres of soleus\\nmuscles of rats showed Z-line dissolution, A-band\\ndisruption and fibre clotting (Ogilvie et al. 1988).\\nSimilarly Friden & Lieber (1998) found that in rabbit\\nmuscle after eccentric contractions there was cytoskeletal\\ndisruption and the presence in fibres of hypercontracted\\nregions.\\nMuscle swelling and soreness\\nEccentric exercise is followed by sensations of stiffness\\nand soreness the next day (Hough, 1902). The current\\nview of the mechanism is that damage at the level of\\nsarcomeres leads, during repeated contractions, to more\\nextensive damage and, ultimately, to death of some\\nmuscle fibres. The injury triggers a local inflammatory\\nresponse that is accompanied by some oedema. The\\nbreakdown products of injured tissues sensitise nociceptors\\n(Smith, 1991; MacIntyre et al.1995).\\nIt has been suggested that a component of the stiffness\\nafter eccentric exercise is due to the swelling accompanying\\nthe damage. Thus Howell et al. (1985) suggested that\\ndelayed increases in stiffness in exercised elbow flexor\\nmuscles were the result of volume changes exerting strain\\non perimysial and epimysial connective tissue elements.\\nA quantitative biomechanical model supported this view\\n(Purslow, 1989). However, passive tension and stiffness\\nchange immediately post-exercise (Howell et al. 1993;\\nChleboun et al.1998; Whitehead et al.2001), when there\\nis not yet any evidence of swelling. In our experiments,\\nthere was a rise in passive tension in ankle extensor\\nmuscles which reached close to its peak value immediately\\nafter the exercise. At 24 h after the exercise, when\\nswelling peaked, there was no significant further increase\\nin passive tension. So under the conditions of our\\nexperiments there did not appear to be a close link\\nbetween passive tension rises and muscle swelling. The\\nswelling began to subside by 4 days post-exercise.\\nSoreness sets in at about 6–8 h after the exercise and\\npeaks at about 48 h (MacIntyre et al. 1995; Jones et al.\\n1997). The current view of the mechanism is that the\\ntissue breakdown products sensitise nociceptors so that\\nthese respond to stimuli that are normally non-noxious.\\nSo the muscle is tender to local palpation, stretch and\\ncontraction. It has recently been proposed that a\\ncomponent of the delayed soreness from eccentric exercise\\ninvolves large-fibre mechanoreceptors (Barlas et al.2000;\\nWeerakkody et al. 2001). It has been postulated that\\ninput from mechanoreceptors, including afferents of\\nmuscle spindles, is able to access the pain pathway at the\\nlevel of the spinal cord. \\nAdaptation\\nWe have all had the experience that the stiffness and\\nsoreness following a period of exercise become very much\\nMechanism of injury from eccentric exerciseJ.

This has been known for\\nsome time (Hough, 1902; Friden et al. 1983; Schwane &\\nArmstrong, 1983; Clarkson & Tremblay, 1988). However,\\nthe underlying mechanism remains controversial (for a\\nreview see McHugh et al.1999).\\nIn his original proposal for a mechanism for the damage\\nfrom eccentric exercise, Morgan (1990) suggested that the\\nsubsequent adaptation process involved an increase in the\\nnumber of sarcomeres in series in muscle fibres. As a\\nconsequence, at a set muscle length, average sarcomere\\nlength would be shorter (Fig. 3B). Therefore less of the\\nmuscle’s working range would include the region of\\npotential instability, the descending limb of the\\nlength–tension curve. Supporting evidence comes from\\nexperiments in which rats were exercised on an inclined\\nor declined treadmill (Lynn & Morgan, 1994; see also\\nLynn et al. 1998). Fibres of a muscle known to undergo\\neccentric contractions during downhill running, vastus\\nintermedius, were fixed, digested and sarcomere numbers\\ncounted after a week of exercise. It was found that the\\nmean number of sarcomeres was, on average, 11%\\ngreater in the muscles of animals which had run downhill,\\ncompared with those which had run uphill.\\nThis proposal has been challenged (Koh & Herzog, 1998;\\nsee also Koh & Brooks, 2001). However, the contrary\\nfindings are difficult to evaluate since in that study of\\nrabbit muscle no indication was given of the length range,\\nwith respect to the optimum length, over which the\\nmuscles were stretched, nor was it stated whether the\\neccentric contraction protocol used was followed by any\\ndetectable signs of disruption or damage.\\nScepticism over an adaptation mechanism involving the\\naddition of extra sarcomeres to muscle fibres centres around\\nthe time course (McHugh et al. 1999). If muscle fibres are\\ngoing to be re-modelled after injury from eccentric exercise,\\nthis process must be rapid enough to be substantially\\ncomplete by the end of a week following the injury. Is\\nmuscle able to undergo such a rapid adaptation process at\\nthe level of the sarcomeres? It was shown back in 1973 that\\nimmobilising a muscle in the lengthened position with a\\nplaster cast led to an increase in sarcomere number in\\nmuscle fibres within 5 days (Williams & Goldspink, 1973).\\nThis increase was rapidly reversible. While we do not yet\\nunderstand the precise details, at the cellular level, of the\\nevents that lead to the adaptation of sarcomere numbers\\n(Goldspink, 1998; see also Wretman et al.2001), the speed\\nof the process is obviously sufficient to account for the\\nadaptation observed after eccentric exercise. \\nU. Proske and D. L. Morgan340 J. Physiol.537.2\\nFigure 5. Sarcomere length–muscle length relation\\nRelation between sarcomere length and muscle length for theoretical muscle fibres comprising different\\nnumbers of sarcomeres and different lengths of tendon. It is assumed that optimum sarcomere length is\\n2.5 µm. For a muscle fibre with 10000 sarcomeres and 20 mm of tendon (fibre no. 1) tension begins to rise\\nat 35 mm and the optimum is reached at 45 mm (dashed line). A shift in optimum length for active tension\\nby 5 mm in the direction of longer lengths (dashed line) can be achieved by increasing the length of tendon\\nto 25 mm (fibre no. 2). The drawback is that active tension is not developed until the muscle is stretched\\nto 40 mm, that is, the working range of muscle lengths has been reduced. Increasing the number of\\nsarcomeres from 10000 to 12000, and leaving tendon length at 20 mm (fibre no. 3) produces the required\\nincrease in optimum length and leads to a smaller reduction in the muscle’s working range, where tension\\nbegins to rise at 39 mm. Increasing sarcomere number further to 14000, while at the same time reducing\\nthe length of tendon to 15 mm (fibre no. 4) produces the most satisfactory result, the required shift in\\noptimum length by 5 mm and reduction of the working range by only 1 mm.\\n'),\n",

We have tried to model this situation (Fig. 5).\\nConsider a muscle composed of muscle fibres containing\\n10000 sarcomeres and 20 mm of tendon. In this model\\nmuscle tension would begin to rise when the muscle was\\nstretched to 35 mm length, representing a sarcomere\\nlength of 1.5 µm. Tension would peak at 45 mm or 2.5 µm\\nsarcomere length. If the aim was to shift the muscle’s\\nlength–tension curve in the direction of longer lengths, to\\nprovide protection against injury from eccentric exercise,\\na simple adaptation would be to increase the length of the\\ntendon by 5 mm. That would shift the optimum length by\\n5 mm. However, tension would be less well maintained at\\nshort muscle lengths, falling to zero at 40 mm rather than\\nat 35 mm. If the number of sarcomeres in the fibre was\\nincreased by 20%, without changing the length of the\\ntendon, the requisite shift in optimum length would still\\nbe obtained but the working range of the muscle would be\\nreduced by 3 mm. Only if sarcomere number was\\nincreased further and the tendon shortened could both a\\nshift in optimum length and maintenance of the original\\nworking range of the muscle be achieved (Fig. 5). In\\npractice, it is unlikely that the tendon is able to be\\nremodelled within a week, although this remains an\\noption for adaptation in the longer term. \\nIs there any evidence for a shift in the length–tension\\ncurve as a sign of a muscle’s adaptation to the injury from\\neccentric contractions? First, it is important to\\ndistinguish between the two kinds of shift that may occur\\nin association with eccentric exercise. Following a period\\nof unaccustomed exercise there will be a shift in optimum\\nlength as a result of the increase in series compliance from\\ndisrupted sarcomeres (Fig. 3A). This is followed by a\\nsecond, delayed shift representing the adaptation by\\nincreasing sarcomere numbers (Fig. 3B). In amphibian\\nmuscles, within about 6 h of the injury from eccentric\\ncontractions, the initial shift in optimum length has\\nreversed and the optimum has returned near to its pre-\\nexercise value (Jones et al. 1997). Here we assume that\\nfollowing the eccentric exercise, in some muscle fibres\\ndisrupted sarcomeres will have managed, over time, to\\nre-establish their normal pattern of myofilament inter-\\ndigitation and ability to generate tension (Talbot &\\nMorgan, 1996). In other fibres, areas of disruption may\\nhave progressed to a more major lesion. Such damaged\\nfibres will no longer contract and therefore cannot\\ncontribute to the shift in the length–tension curve. Both\\nof these factors will lead to a reversal of the shift. \\nIn a study of human triceps surae, it was possible to\\nidentify a damage-related shift in optimum angle for\\ntorque in the direction of longer muscle lengths after a\\nperiod of eccentric exercise, but this had reversed back to\\ncontrol values by 2 days post-exercise (Jones et al. 1997).\\nNo subsequent shift due to adaptation could be detected.\\nIn a subsequent study of the hamstrings muscle group, a\\nsustained shift in optimum angle was able to be\\ndemonstrated (Brockett et al. 2001a). Here, while a\\ntraining effect was clearly evident, it was not possible to\\nidentify its point of onset, nor any reversal from a shift\\nattributable to injury. Presumably in situations like this,\\nthe time course of recovery from the initial shift and the\\nonset of the adaptation process may overlap.\\nIn animal experiments it has been shown that fibres of\\nvastus intermedius muscles of rats, trained to run downhill\\nfor a week, had more sarcomeres than fibres from an uphill\\ntrained group. At the end of training, in response to an\\nacute series of eccentric contractions, beginning from the\\nsame knee angle, the downhill-trained group showed a\\nsmaller shift in optimum angle for torque than the uphill-\\ntrained group. The smaller shift was considered an\\nindication of less damage (Lynn et al.1998). \\nThere is also limited evidence of an adaptation process in\\nthe opposite direction (Whitehead et al.1998). A group of\\nhuman subjects was required to carry out a period of\\nconcentric exercise with triceps surae of one leg, the other\\nleg acting as a control. In response to a test period of\\neccentric exercise a week later, the concentrically trained\\nmuscles showed a larger shift in optimum, indicative of\\nmore damage, than the control muscles. It was suggested\\nthat during concentric exercise muscle fibres may lose\\nsarcomeres, leading to a greater vulnerability to damage\\nfrom eccentric exercise.Muscle sense organs\\nWhile quite a lot is known about the effects of fatigue\\nfrom exercise on local reflex action of muscle afferents\\n(for a review, see Gandevia, 2001), the question of\\nwhether eccentric exercise leads to damage in muscle\\nreceptors remains an open one. Here the discussion will be\\nrestricted to the two prominent muscle receptors, the\\nmuscle spindle and tendon organ.\\nIn an elbow position matching task, carried out after a\\nperiod of eccentric exercise of elbow flexors of one arm, it\\nwas found that the exercised arm consistently adopted a\\nmore flexed position in matching the position of the\\nunexercised arm (Saxton et al.1995). Given that the main\\nproprioceptors signalling limb position are the muscle\\nspindles (Gandevia, 1996; Proske et al. 2000), the result\\nsuggests that the signal from muscle spindles had\\nincreased as a result of the exercise. That is, to get a set\\nlevel of proprioceptive signal, the exercised muscle had to\\nbe stretched less than the control muscle. The current\\nview is that the level of resting activity from muscle\\nspindles signals the length of the muscle and, so, the\\nposition of the elbow. If as a result of the exercise some\\nintrafusal fibres of spindles had become damaged and\\ndeveloped an injury contracture, this would be expected\\nto raise the level of resting activity for a given muscle\\nlength and so explain the above results.\\nMechanism of injury from eccentric exerciseJ.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\muscleSoreness.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='A second experiment by Brockett et al. (1997) employed a\\nrather milder exercise regime and elbow flexors of one\\narm underwent eccentric contractions, while flexors of\\nthe other arm underwent concentric contractions, over\\nthe same period. Here there was only a small, transient\\ndrop in tension, post-exercise, suggesting minimal\\ndamage to the muscle, but over the next 48 h subjects\\nmatched the position of the concentrically exercised arm\\nby placing the eccentrically exercised arm in a more\\nextended position. This result was therefore the opposite\\nof that of Saxton et al. (1995). The explanation probably\\nrelates to the difference in severity of the exercises. Mild\\neccentric exercise might be expected to produce some\\nsarcomere disruption, leading to an increase in series\\ncompliance. That, in turn, would increase the length\\nthreshold for tension (Whitehead et al. 2001) and the\\nmuscle would have to be stretched further to achieve a set\\nlevel of spindle discharge. If the spindles had actually\\nbecome damaged the opposite result would have been\\nobtained. These kinds of propositions should now be\\ntested on single, identified receptors in animal\\nexperiments. \\nSome observations have also been made on tendon organs\\nafter a period of eccentric exercise (Gregory et al.2001). In\\nanaesthetised cats, the medial gastrocnemius muscle was\\nsubjected to a series of lengthening contractions and the\\nresponses of tendon organs measured to both passive and\\nactive tension changes before and after the exercise. It\\nwas found that in response to a slow stretch after the\\nexercise, tendon organs commenced firing at a shorter\\nmuscle length. This was attributed to the rise in whole-\\nmuscle passive tension, post-exercise. In one animal, all of\\nthe sample of six tendon organs isolated signalled this\\nincrease, suggesting that the damage producing the rise in\\npassive tension was widespread throughout the muscle.\\nHowever tension threshold and tendon organ sensitivity\\nhad not changed suggesting that the exercise had not\\ndisturbed, in any way, the normal functioning of the\\nreceptors.\\nClinical applications\\nSince eccentric exercise produces muscle damage, weakness\\nand soreness, it raises the question of whether the mild\\nsymptoms we all experience on occasions may, at times,\\nlead to more major injuries. A specific case in point is the\\nhamstring tear (Brockett et al. 2001a). Clinical reports\\nsuggest that hamstring injuries occur most often as a result\\nof eccentric contractions (Stanton & Purdham, 1989;\\nGarrett, 1990; Kujala et al. 1997; Sallay et al. 1996). It is\\npossible that in some elite sports such as track and field\\nevents, football and rugby, the micro-damage from mild\\neccentric exercise may, as a result of the demands placed on\\nthe muscle by the competitive event, progress to more\\nmajor tears. If so, then a way to combat the problem would\\nbe to subject athletes to a mild eccentric exercise program to\\neffect an adaptation that protected the muscles at risk\\nagainst further damage. This proposition is currently being\\nput to the test in our laboratory. \\nAnother area where the adaptation effect from eccentric\\nexercise may prove useful is with a condition known as\\nidiopathic toe walking (equinus gait). It is a condition\\ncommonly found in children. They adopt a strongly\\nplantar-flexed posture with their foot and walk on the\\nheads of their metatarsals, rather than with a heel-to-toe\\naction. Toe walking is sometimes associated with cerebral\\npalsy but it also presents in the absence of neurological\\nsigns, in otherwise normal children. Current standard\\ntreatments designed to bring the heel down onto the\\nground include botulinum toxin injections into triceps\\nsurae to relax the muscle, plaster casts applied with the\\nmuscle in a dorsiflexed position, and insertion of stiff\\ngraphite plates in the shoes of afflicted children. We have\\nrecently explored the possibility of effecting an adaption\\nin triceps surae by giving the children a specific\\nprogramme of eccentric exercise of ankle extensor\\nmuscles, using a motorised foot plate. While the work is\\nstill ongoing, preliminary data suggest that, in the\\nfuture, the more invasive treatments may be able to be\\nreplaced by exercise regimes (D. L. Morgan, C. Blackburn\\n& P. Percival, unpublished observations).\\nFinally, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a degenerative\\nmuscle disease related to the lack of a protein associated\\nwith the sarcolemma, dystrophin. It is know that\\ndystrophin-deficient mice are particularly vulnerable to\\nthe damage from eccentric contractions (Head et al.1992;\\nMoens et al. 1993). It raises the possibility that\\ndegenerative changes in muscles of humans afflicted with\\nthe disease may be triggered by eccentric contractions.\\nStrategies aimed at minimising such damage would be to\\navoid eccentric contractions altogether or alternatively\\nembark on a programme of very mild, non-injurious\\neccentric exercise, in the hope of effecting an adaptation\\nprocess in the affected muscles.Concluding comments\\nThis review has focused the discussion on the initial series\\nof events leading to the damage to muscle from eccentric\\nexercise (Fig. 1). In our view, the body of evidence in\\nsupport of the sarcomere non-uniformity hypothesis has\\ngrown considerably in recent times and therefore a review\\nof its current status is called for. Its appeal is that it is\\nable to account for the length dependence of the amount\\nof damage and for the observed differences in effects\\nfrom concentric and eccentric exercise. It also helps to\\nexplain several other behaviours of skeletal muscle that\\nhave hitherto resisted satisfactory explanations (Noble,\\n1992; Morgan, 1994; Morgan et al.2000). Another area of\\nattention in the review has been the various signs of\\ninjury accompanying the damage. These may, in future,\\nhave practical applications.

Although neck pain may \\nnot be the most common musculoskeletal disorder, it \\nis still very important [1, 2]. The economic burden of \\nneck pain is remarkable and includes treatment costs, \\nreduced productivity and job-related problems. In 2016, \\namong the 154 conditions, low back and neck pain had \\nthe highest health care spending in the United States \\nwith an estimated $134.5 billion [3]. In 2012, neck pain \\nwas responsible for job absences among 25.5 million \\nAmericans, who missed an average of 11.4 days of work \\n[4]. In 2017, the global age-standardised prevalence and \\nincidence rate of neck pain were 3551.1 and 806.6 per \\n100,000, respectively [5].\\nThere is no one definitive treatment for neck pain. \\nHowever, different pharmacological and non-pharmaco -\\nlogical treatments have been recommended, including \\nlaser therapy, massage, acupuncture, yoga, and aquatic \\ntherapy [6–8].\\nThe present study aims to provide a narrative review \\nof the most recent data on the epidemiology and trends \\nassociated with neck pain.

In 2017, the number of neck pain cases \\nin females was 166.0 million (118.7 to 224.8), while for \\nmales it was 122.7 million (87.1 to 167.5) [5]. Further -\\nmore, the number of years lived with disability (YLDs) \\nfrom neck pain was higher in females (16.4 million (10.0 \\nto 25.1) than among males (12.2 million (7.4 to 18.9) [5]. \\nGlobally, in 2017 the age-standardised prevalence of neck \\npain increased with age up to 70–74, and then decreased \\nwith advancing age (Fig.\\xa0 5). The YLDs pattern across the \\nage groups was relatively similar to that of the estimated \\npoint prevalence [5].\\nRisk factors\\nNeck pain is a multifactorial disease. Several population-\\nbased studies have explored the role of various modifi -\\nable and non-modifiable risk factors for neck pain, such \\nas advanced age, being female, low social support, and a \\nhistory of neck or lower back pain [9–12]. Since there is \\na tendency for neck pain to become a chronic problem, \\nit is important to identify risk factors in order to enable \\nprevention and early diagnosis [12]. As neck pain is a \\nmultifactorial disease, there are a number of risk factors \\nwhich can contribute to its development. There is, how -\\never, more evidence for some risk factors, such as lack \\nof physical activity, duration of daily computer use, per -\\nceived stress and being female [13]. Identifying protec -\\ntive or risk factors, triggers and outcomes can help guide \\nthe prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of \\nneck pain. The following section describes the research \\nevidence of a number of psychological and biological fac -\\ntors associated with neck pain.\\nPsychological factors\\nThe literature demonstrates a clear link between psy -\\nchological variables and neck/back pain [14, 15]. A study \\nbased on the China Mental Health Survey showed that \\nthe prevalence of chronic back or neck pain among peo -\\nple with any type of mental disorders was more than \\ntwice that of those without a mental disorder, with a par -\\nticularly high prevalence among those with mood disor -\\nders [16]. Prospective investigations have demonstrated \\nthat psychological variables are related to the onset and \\nseverity of pain (i.e. acute, sub-acute, and chronic). Stress, \\ndistress, anxiety, mood and emotions, cognitive function-\\ning, and pain-related behaviors have all been found to \\nbe important factors in the development of neck pain. \\nAlthough there is not much evidence for personality \\nFig. 4 Age standardised annual incidence of neck pain per 100,000 population in 2017, by country.

A second theme is the \\nemotional dimension, in which distress, anxiety, and \\ndepression are the most important variables. Thirdly, \\nthere is a social dimension, where family and work issues \\nseem to be related to neck and back pain, although the \\ndata are less convincing. Finally, a behavioral domain has \\nalso emerged, in which coping, pain behaviors, and activ -\\nity patterns are important elements [14, 18–21].\\nStress\\nStress is related to pain and disability [14, 15]. Perceived \\nstress is a risk factor for neck pain [19, 22]. At least two \\ninvestigations, with fair methodological quality, have \\nfound that adolescents with neck pain had significantly \\nmore symptoms of stress than adolescents without neck \\npain, and that permanent and/or regular feelings of stress \\nwas significantly associated with an increased odds of \\nreporting neck pain [23]. Stress may contribute to altered \\ncentral pain processing at the spinal, brainstem, or corti -\\ncal levels, which may present as remote hyperalgesia - a \\ncondition in which individuals experience an enhanced \\nsensitivity to pain [17, 24]. Moreover, stress acts as a \\nmediator between pain and disability [25, 26].\\nAnxiety\\nAnxiety is related to different kinds of chronic pain (e.g., \\nneck pain), as well as disability [14, 15, 27, 28]. Neck pain \\nhas been found to be comorbid with anxiety [28–30]. \\nTrait and state anxiety were investigated using two differ-\\nent measurement instruments and the researchers found \\nthat adolescents with neck pain had higher levels of trait \\nand state anxiety than adolescents without neck pain \\n[23]. Furthermore, anxiety disorders were found to be the \\nsecond most common comorbid disease associated with \\nneck pain, and specific phobias were the most prevalent \\nproblem among those with anxiety disorders [16].\\nAn association between lower pressure pain thresh -\\nolds (PPTs) and increased levels of anxiety have also been \\nreported. PPTs have been found to be associated with \\nFig. 5 Global number of incident c ases and age‑standardised annual incidence rate of neck pain per 100,000 population by age and sex, 2017; \\nDotted and dashed lines indicate 95% upper and lower uncertainty intervals, respectively.

People with neck pain have reported \\nhigher levels of anxiety [31], and anxiety has also been \\nfound to exacerbate pain and disability [25]. However, \\nthere are also some discrepancies in the findings, with \\none study on the components of psychological distress \\n(e.g., stress, anxiety, and depression) reporting that \\nanxiety was not a mediator for pain and disability [26]. \\nSurvey-specific estimates have also revealed some incon -\\nsistencies in the comorbidity between spinal pain, both \\nback and neck pain, and anxiety disorders. For instance, \\nonly 10 out of 17 surveys showed significantly increased \\nodds ratios for chronic neck pain among those with gen -\\neralized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia/panic disor -\\nder. Therefore, there are some variations in the size of \\nthis association between studies and between countries, \\nalthough chronic spinal pain seems to increase the likeli -\\nhood of comorbid anxiety disorders.\\nThe research has also shown that some specific types \\nof anxiety disorders are more strongly associated with \\nspinal pain than others. Generalized anxiety disorder and \\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to \\nbe comorbid with spinal pain than social phobia or panic \\ndisorder/agoraphobia [28, 30, 32]. However, research has \\nfound neck pain to be more common in patients with \\nmood disorders than among those with specific anxiety \\ndisorders [30].\\nDepression\\nThe relationship between depression and neck pain \\nappears to be bidirectional [33]. Mood disorders, espe -\\ncially depression, have been found to be related to \\nchronic neck pain and disabilities [14, 27, 30, 32]. Neck \\npain is also commonly reported in individuals with \\nunderlying depression [13, 29, 34]. Furthermore, a meta-\\nanalysis reported that symptoms of depression were \\nassociated with high morbidity in neck pain patients [21]. \\nMoreover, a review article suggested that the strong -\\nest psychosocial risk factors among respondents with \\nchronic back or neck pain were depressed mood [12] \\nand major depression [30]. A survey study in China \\nshowed that mood disorders have a higher comorbid -\\nity with neck pain than other mental disorders, and that \\nmajor depression had the highest comorbidity among all \\nmood disorders [16]. Furthermore, seven studies with \\nfair methodological quality, investigated depression using \\na total of six different measurement instruments and all \\nstudies found that adolescents with neck pain had more \\ndepressive symptoms than asymptomatic adolescents \\n[23]. In fact, depressive symptoms may affect central \\npain processing at the spinal, brainstem or cortical levels, \\nwhich can be manifested as remote hyperalgesia [17, 35]. \\nDepression and pain might also be risk factors for each \\nother [21]. Several studies have pointed out that psycho -\\nlogical stress and the potential obstacles caused by pain \\nmay produce immunological changes that eventually \\nresults in depression and anxiety [21]. Studies have also \\nfound that depression acts as a mediator between pain \\nand disability [25, 26].\\nCognitive variables\\nCognitive factors (i.e. attitudes, cognitive style, and fear-\\navoidance beliefs) have been linked to increased pain, \\nsuch as neck pain and disability [14, 15, 27]. Pain cogni -\\ntions, like catastrophizing and self-perceived poor health, \\nare related to pain and disability [14], as are fear-avoid -\\nance beliefs and passive coping [14]. Pain catastrophiz -\\ning, which is a cognitive factor, may also contribute to \\naltered central pain processing at several levels (i.e., the \\nspinal, brainstem or cortical levels), which may be exhib -\\nited as remote hyperalgesia [17, 36]. Research has found \\nthat adolescents with neck pain had higher levels of cata -\\nstrophizing, compared to adolescents without neck pain \\n[23]. In general, people with neck pain report higher lev -\\nels of catastrophizing than those without neck pain [31].\\nAnother significant cognitive factor is self-efficacy, \\nwhich has been shown to be related to neck pain [27]. \\nLow pain self-efficacy has been found to be associated \\nwith greater functional disability in patients with neck \\npain [27], although an article by Andias et\\xa0al. showed that \\nthe difference in self-efficacy levels among adolescents \\nwith and without neck pain remains controversial [23].\\nLow resilience is another psychological factor which \\nhas been found to be associated with greater functional \\ndisability in patients with neck and back pain [27].\\nSleep problems\\nThe relationship between sleep quality and neck pain \\nis bidirectional, as both can lead to the other [37]. Five \\ninvestigations, including one longitudinal and four cross-\\nsectional studies, most of which were fair methodologi -\\ncal quality, assessed sleep using a total of six different \\nmeasurement instruments and found some evidence that \\ninsufficient quantity and quality of sleep were signifi -\\ncantly associated with increased odds of having neck pain \\n[23]. Therefore, sleep management might be a promising \\nintervention for decreasing pain sensitivity and increas -\\ning pain modulatory capacity [17, 38].\\nThere is research to suggest that females with low sleep \\nquality are at a higher risk of neck pain onset, but the \\nfindings in male have been inconsistent. Furthermore, \\none high-quality study found no significant relationship \\nbetween sleep and shoulder pain, indicating that there is \\neither weak evidence or no higher risk [39–41].

Neck pain has been found to have a positive \\nrelationship with poor general social support [27] and \\npoor social support at work [2]. A negative relationship \\nbetween neck complaints and actively seeking social sup -\\nport has also been reported [42].\\nPersonality\\nNo evidence exists to support the theory of a “pain \\nprone” personality. Furthermore, findings on the rela -\\ntionship between personality traits or disorders and neck \\npain have been contradictory [14].\\nBehavior\\nDangerous behaviors, digital habits, and abnormal eat -\\ning-related behaviors, such as food insecurity, are com -\\nmon in early adulthood and these behaviors may also \\ncontribute to the development of neck pain [13]. Coping \\nstyles are the typical manner in which individuals con -\\nfront and deal with stressful situations, including illness \\nor pain. There are three basic coping styles, which are \\ntask-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented \\n[43]. The relationship between the different coping strate-\\ngies and pain has been investigated by several studies [44, \\n45]. Individuals with an avoidance-oriented strategy have \\na longer duration of neck complaints, since when faced \\nwith a problematic situation they seek distraction, avoid \\nthinking about their problem and try to feel better by \\nsmoking, drinking, or relaxing [42]. Furthermore, those \\nwho react with annoyance or anger tend to have a longer \\nduration of neck complaints [42]. In contrast, there is a \\nnegative relationship between seeking social support \\nand neck complaints. In fact, people with neck problems \\ncomplain of neck pain for a shorter period of time when \\nthey share their concerns with others and receive social \\nsupport and understanding [42].\\nWork‑related factors\\nIn a review, the most commonly reported risk factor was \\nworking in awkward/sustained postures [12]. Work and \\nstudy time, workload and body position at work are the \\nmost important contributors to neck pain [13]. Work-\\nplace characteristics, such as perceived job demands, \\neffort-reward imbalance and coworker support were all \\nsignificant risk factors [12]. Furthermore, research has \\nfound neck pain to be related to low job control, routine \\nwork, lack of decision making opportunities, low ability \\nto influence working conditions, low job satisfaction, and \\nhigh job strain [2]. Furthermore, high job demands and \\nlow coworker support are independent risk factors for \\nneck pain and there is also evidence that low decision-\\nmaking authority is a risk factor for neck pain [46].\\nThere is some evidence that high skill discretion has \\na protective effect from neck pain [2]. However, work -\\ning with a computer is considered to be an occupational \\ncondition that causes neck pain [19]. Several factors have \\nbeen suggested to play key roles in the development of \\ncomputer-related neck pain, including posture, duration \\nworking at a computer, psychological stress, repetitive \\nmovements, prolonged static loads, and the psychosocial \\neffects of the working environment [19]. Furthermore, \\nthere is also an association between neck pain and eye -\\nstrain, regardless of other conditions [19].\\nNeuromusculoskeletal disorders\\nThere are a number of diseases and ailments which \\nhave been identified as contributing to neck pain. Neu -\\nromusculoskeletal disorders affect the bones, muscles, \\nand nerves, and can manifest themselves in several \\nways. Neck pain is one of the most common and obvi -\\nous complaints of patients with disorders, such as cervi -\\ncal spondylosis, fibromyalgia, cervical radiculopathy, and \\nwhiplash-associated disorders (WADs) [47, 48].\\nCervical spondylosis is an umbrella term for a cluster \\nof abnormalities, all of which involve progressive degen -\\nerative changes that affect all components of the cervical \\nspine, which is the most frequent neuromusculoskeletal \\ncause of neck pain [49]. In general, neck or occipital pain \\nis known as the first clinical manifestation of degenera -\\ntive cervical spondylosis. Several factors can lead to cer -\\nvical spondylosis, such as a congenital narrowing of the \\ncervical spinal canal, cervical osteoarthritis, neck arthri -\\ntis, trauma, and wearing of the spinal disks. The likeli -\\nhood of developing cervical spondylosis increases with \\nage, especially after the fourth decade of life, and its pro -\\ngressive nature eventually leads to the involvement of \\nmore than one intervertebral disc [50]. The severity of \\na patient’s signs and symptoms are determinative of the \\ntreatment strategy. In addition to pain relievers, non-\\ninvasive pain relief techniques (e.g., physical therapy and \\nneck mobilisation/manipulation), and medications can \\nhelp ease neck pain from cervical spondylosis. Surgical \\nintervention is also effective in preventing the progres -\\nsion of neurologic decline [51].\\nFibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread \\nmusculoskeletal pain and additional symptoms, such as \\nextreme tiredness, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunc -\\ntion, and mood problems. Previous studies have shown \\nthat genetic and epigenetic factors have a critical role in \\ndisease susceptibility. While the signs and symptoms vary '),\n",

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2022) 23:26 \\ngreatly, neck pain is the most frequent complaint among \\npatients [52, 53].\\nCervical radiculopathy is a type of neck disorder that \\nresults from the compression or irritation of the nerve \\nroots in the cervical spine. Nerve root compression can \\noccur due to spondylosis, instability, trauma, or rarely \\ntumors. The clinical manifestations of radiculopathy are \\nbroad, but neck and shoulder pain are the primary com -\\nplications in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The \\ndifferential diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, includes \\ncardiac pain, musculoskeletal diseases, infections, and \\nmalignancies [54, 55].\\nWhiplash-associated disorders (WAD) are character -\\nized by a collection of symptoms affecting the neck and \\nare triggered by sudden acceleration-deceleration move -\\nments. WADs are characterized by several clinical com -\\nplications, including neck pain, nonspecific headache, \\ndizziness, and temporomandibular joint pain that are \\ntriggered by a sudden force which stretches the neck \\nmuscles and tendons. The prevalence of WADs var -\\nies around the world, but up to 50% of patients develop \\nchronic pain. Therefore, the prevalence of cervical facet \\npain is high in whiplash patients [56–58].\\nAutoimmune diseases\\nAutoimmune diseases are a chronic and clinically hetero-\\ngeneous group of diseases that occur in immunocompro -\\nmised individuals. Autoimmune diseases affect various \\norgans and tissues throughout the body. In some auto -\\nimmune diseases, the muscles, joints, and nerves can be \\nthe target of the immune system, so they are also likely \\nto affect the cervical spine. The most important auto -\\nimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia \\nrheumatic, multiple sclerosis (MS), ankylosing spondy -\\nlitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myositis, and \\npsoriatic spondylitis.\\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease \\nthat primarily affects the bones, peripheral joints, and \\nligaments, although it can also affect almost every sys -\\ntem. Peripheral joint swelling is a common early symp -\\ntom, and chronic inflammation of the cervical spine is \\nthe second most common feature of rheumatoid arthri -\\ntis, affecting more than half of all patients with rheuma -\\ntoid arthritis. Neck pain is one of the earliest symptoms \\nto indicate cervical spine involvement in a patient’s \\nrheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, occipital headaches \\nand other neurological symptoms may also present in \\npatients with cervical spine involvement [59, 60].\\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is a relatively common chronic \\ninflammatory disorder that is often associated with giant \\ncell arteritis and is characterized by widespread aches and \\nstiffness of the neck, shoulder, and hip area. The average \\nage of patients with polymyalgia rheumatic is 70 and it is \\nrarely found in anyone under 50 years of age. Therefore, \\nit would appear that age-related immune activation, in \\nresponse to environmental triggers, may contribute to \\nthe development of polymyalgia rheumatica [61, 62].\\nMS is considered a multifocal inflammatory autoim -\\nmune disease that affects the central nervous system \\n(CNS) and often results in the patient experiencing \\nchronic pain. There are a number of different fac -\\ntors, such as age, sex, disease duration, depression, and \\nfatigue, which cause the prevalence of neck pain to dif -\\nfer widely in patients with MS. Neck pain in MS patients \\ncan be due to immobility or Lhermitte’s sign, which is \\ndefined as a transient short-lasting sensation related to \\nneck movement [63].\\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a progressive and debilitat -\\ning form of arthritis that mainly results in inflammation \\nof the joints of the spine. Neck pain is also common in \\nthese patients, due to the inflammation of the cervi -\\ncal spine. Recent genetic studies have identified several \\ngenes and multiple pathways involved in ankylosing \\nspondylitis. In particular, the activation of specific \\nimmune pathways plays a critical role in ankylosing \\nspondylitis pathogenesis [64].\\nSLE is a severe systemic autoimmune disease that can \\naffect almost any part of the body. Therefore, chronic \\npain and fatigue are very common in patients with SLE. \\nInflamed muscles can cause neck and back pain in SLE \\npatients [65].\\nMyositis is a rare chronic systemic autoimmune dis -\\nease that is characterized by profound muscle inflamma -\\ntion and progressive muscle weakness. Myositis typically \\nbilaterally affects the skeletal muscles, including the neck, \\nshoulders, hips, and back muscles. Myositis can affect \\npeople of any age and, similar to most autoimmune dis -\\neases, there is a greater prevalence of myositis in females \\nthan among males [66].\\nPsoriatic arthritis refers to a group of chronic inflam -\\nmatory joint diseases that develop in some people with \\npsoriasis. Psoriatic spondylitis is a subtype of psoriatic \\narthritis that affects the spine and causes pain and stiff -\\nness in the back and neck [67].\\nGenetic\\nGenetic susceptibility plays an important role in the \\ndevelopment of complex diseases. Unraveling the genetic \\ncontributions to complex traits is one of the greatest \\nchallenges facing modern medical genetics. The identi -\\nfication of the genetic determinants of complex diseases \\ncan help provide some understanding of the pathogenesis \\nof the disease. Twin studies and genome-wide association \\nstudies (GWASs) can help to develop insights into the \\ngenetic architecture of diseases.'),\n",

BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders           (2022) 23:26 \\n \\nSeveral population-based twin studies confirm the \\ngenetic influence on neck pain. Twin cohort studies com-\\npare the concordance rate among monozygotic (MZ) \\nand dizygotic (DZ) twins. The greater similarity of MZ, \\nthan DZ, demonstrates the strong genetic contribution to \\nthe development of neck pain [68–73]. However, genetic \\nfactors seem especially important in the development \\nof neck pain in early adolescence, while their influence \\ncould be considered negligible at older ages [68, 72, 74].\\nThere are very few studies which have attempted to \\nunravel the genetic basis of neck pain. GWASs are a pow-\\nerful approach to identify the genetic loci that predispose \\nindividuals to complex diseases. A recent GWAS of the \\nUnited Kingdom (UK) Biobank participants revealed that \\nthere are three genetic loci associated with neck or shoul-\\nder pain, including an intergenic region in chromosome \\n17 for rs12453010, FOXP2 gene in chromosome 7 for \\nrs34291892 and rs62053992 in LINC01572 gene in chro -\\nmosome 16 [75]. However, to the best of our knowledge, \\nonly one GWAS study has been published to date and \\nfurther evidence should be sought to confirm the genetic \\ncorrelations between these loci and neck pain.\\nGender\\nThe results of several systematic reviews have demon -\\nstrated that gender is a well-studied but ambiguous risk \\nfactor for neck pain. Previous studies have considered \\nbeing female to be a significant risk factor for developing \\nneck pain [11, 76]. Nevertheless, in contrast to previous \\nneck pain articles, recent epidemiological studies have \\nfound no meaningful sex differences in the prevalence, \\nincidence, and years lived with disability across the age \\ngroups in patients with neck pain [12, 13, 77]. However, \\nthe point prevalence of neck pain was higher in females \\nacross all age groups [5]. These contradictions are also \\nevident from the articles that report being female to be a \\nweak predictor of developing neck pain, since the age of \\nonset is also important and this may differ between males \\nand females. For this reason, sex-specific meta-analyses \\nare needed to clarify the ambiguous association between \\nsex and neck pain.\\nAge\\nAging is the most important risk factor for most chronic \\npain, so identifying protective and risk factors is critical \\nfor raising awareness about effective preventative meas -\\nures and educational interventions for high-risk groups \\n[11]. The normal anatomy of the cervical spine changes at \\nadvanced ages, which can cause neck pain and long-term \\ndisability. Neck pain is common among adults, although \\nit can occur at any age. According to the Global Burden \\nof Diseases 2017 study, the point prevalence of neck pain \\npeaked during the middle ages and declined thereafter, \\nwith the highest burdens being in the 45–49 and 50–54 \\nage groups for men and women, respectively [5].\\nDiscussion\\nIn this narrative review, we aimed to provide the most \\nrecent data on the epidemiology and trends associated \\nwith neck pain, and its attributable risk factors, in order \\nto highlight gaps in our knowledge and to stimulate and \\nfocus further research, as well as to help healthcare policy \\nmakers and clinicians preventing and controlling this dis-\\nease. Our narrative review showed that the global epide -\\nmiology of neck pain has not changed substantially over \\nthe last 30 years. We also found that both biological and \\npsychological risk factors, like age, genetics, past medi -\\ncal history of musculoskeletal disorders, stress, anxiety, \\nand depression can promote the occurrence of neck pain. \\nHowever, the effects of some other factors, like person -\\nality disorders and gender need to be investigated more \\ndeeply.\\nEfforts to identify the potential risk factors for neck \\npain have been underway for decades. The effects of dif -\\nferent types of psychological and biological factors have \\nbeen presented previously [14], but these often had small \\nsample sizes [9, 76]. Furthermore, there is a paucity of \\nprimary research conducted in several areas of the world, \\nwhich could lead to limitations in the data sources used \\nto estimate the burden of neck pain in different regions \\n[78]. This article placed the risk factors into two main \\ncategories, which were psychological and biological fac -\\ntors. However, there are other methods of categorizing \\nthe risk factors, such as according to the level of associa -\\ntion and preventative potential. For example, risk factors \\ncould be divided into those that have a high correlation \\nand are difficult or impossible to prevent, risk factors \\nwith a strong correlation that are preventable, and factors \\nthat have a low correlation with neck pain. Furthermore, \\nas previously mentioned, several factors (e.g., sleep dis -\\nturbances and depression) have a bidirectional associa -\\ntion with neck pain.\\nThe risk factors for neck pain can be placed into three \\ncategories, which are physical, psychosocial, and indi -\\nvidual-related risk factors. In a review by Kim et\\xa0al., they \\nfound that most risk factors for neck pain were related \\nto psychosocial, rather than physical characteristics [12]. \\nNeck pain has also been associated with many other \\ncomorbidities, such as headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and \\ndepression [29]. Nevertheless, there are also some incon -\\nsistencies in the research investigating the relationship \\nneck pain has with psychological factors.\\nThere are also several risk factors, like depression and \\noccupational factors that not only have a strong asso -\\nciation with neck pain, but are also preventable.

Further -\\nmore, neck pain is the second most common musculo -\\nskeletal disorders with a higher prevalence and incidence \\namong females [5, 79]. Moreover, in 2016, low-back \\nand neck pain were the third largest cause of disability-\\nadjusted life-years (DALYs) in both sexes (87 million (61 \\nto 114)) [80]. Therefore, finding a cost-effective diag -\\nnostic method and treatment strategy is important [81]. \\nFurthermore, improvements in the definition and regis -\\ntration of pain conditions, such as neck pain, could make \\na large contribution to improving health by providing \\nreliable estimates of the burden of neck pain which can \\nlead to appropriate resource allocation and the imple -\\nmentation of preventative and treatment programs [78].\\nAs previously mentioned, work-related factors (e.g., \\nwork load, working on a computer, and study time) are \\nrisk factors for the development of neck pain. Neverthe -\\nless, children and adolescents are also at a risk of devel -\\noping neck pain. A cross-sectional study of 207 children \\nand adolescents with non-specific neck pain showed that \\nstrong flexion of the neck during studying, sitting, watch-\\ning television, and using smartphones (or other handheld \\ndevices) was associated with neck pain [82]. Furthermore, \\nan article by Scarabottolo et\\xa0 al. revealed that physical \\ninactivity in adolescents was associated with an increase \\nin the risk of cervical pain (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49 (1.06–\\n2.10)) [83]. Moreover, using a mobile phone for more \\nthan 10 h per week significantly increased the odds of \\ndeveloping neck pain in students aged 10–17 years old \\n(OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.29–4.75) [84].\\nThere is now evidence from large epidemiological \\nstudies that there is an association between mental dis -\\norders and chronic pain. The comorbidity between psy -\\nchological disorders and pain has implications for the \\noutcome of pain and possibly also for the outcome of \\nthe psychological disorders. The relationship between \\npsychological disorders and chronic pain, in the case \\nof co-occurrence, is often complex and cannot be eas -\\nily interpreted and managed. Although a relationship \\nbetween chronic pain and psychiatric disorders has \\nbeen identified, the relationship pain severity has with \\nmood or anxiety disorders is less clear [32]. Further -\\nmore, research in diverse cultures and socioeconomic \\nsituations has shown that people with chronic neck pain \\nwere more likely to suffer from psychological disorders \\n(e.g., mood, anxiety, and alcohol disorders), compared to \\nthose without neck pain [30].\\nThe most prominent limitation of this study is that \\nit had a narrative approach, rather than a systematic \\nreview and meta-analysis, so it is difficult to draw pre -\\ncise conclusions.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\pain.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content='Concepts of pain\\nIn 1965, the Melzack-Wall gate control theory 1\\nemphasised the mechanisms in the central nervous\\nsystem that control the perception of a noxious stimulus,\\nand thus integrated afferent, upstream processes with\\ndownstream modulation from the brain. However, this\\ntheory did not incorporate long-term changes in the\\ncentral nervous system to the noxious input and to other\\nexternal factors that impinge upon the individual. It is\\nnow widely recognised that nociceptor function is altered\\nby the “inflammatory soup” that characterises a region of\\ntissue injury.2\\nThis dynamic feature is usually temporary and exists\\nwhile the body heals a region of injury. The modifiers of\\nnociceptor activity are also transient. However, Dubner\\nand Ruda 3 showed that huge nociceptive input can—\\nthrough the mechanism of excitatory toxic effects of\\naminoacids—permanently change spinal-cord function\\nand could, therefore, lead to chronic pain after an acute\\ninjury.\\nPhysiological and behavioural studies have shown that\\nplasticity, or learning, has a role in pain. Hence, synaptic\\npotentiation is facilitated by repetitive noxious\\nstimulation, and, at the level of the brain, environmental\\ninfluences alter the response to noxious stimulation. 4,5 It\\nis clear from clinical pain states that the brain can\\ngenerate pain in the absence of input from the peripheral\\nnociceptors or the spinal cord—for example, in phantom\\nlimb pain and pain perceived by paraplegic patients below\\nthe level of a total spinal cord transection. A pattern-\\ngenerating mechanism, or neuromatrix, must, therefore,\\nexist in the brain that is capable of sustaining an image \\nTHE LANCET • Vol 353 • May 8, 1999 1607\\nLancet 1999;353:1607–09\\nSee Commentary page 1546\\nDepartment of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington,\\nBox356470, Seattle, WA98195, USA (J D Loeser MD); and\\nDepartment of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, \\nQuebec, Canada\\nCorrespondence to: Dr John D Loeser\\n(e-mail: jdloeser@u.washington.edu)\\nof the body upon which sensory data are played. 6–8\\nPerception of pain is, thus, generated by the output or the\\nneuromatrix as a function of sensory inputs that feed into\\nit, together with information from regions of the brain\\ninvolved in affective and cognitive activities. Moreover,\\npain behaviours can be generated or perpetuated by\\npreviously conditioned cues in the environment or by \\nthe expectation of pain and suffering. The figure shows\\nhow the widely distributed, parallel-processing neural\\nnetworks in the central nervous system generate the nerve\\nimpulse patterns that produce the various somatic\\nexperiences, including transient, acute, and chronic pain.\\nThe output of the neuromatrix can be modified by\\nmultiple forms of treatment to change the inputs and\\ninfluences on the neuromatrix.\\nInjury does not only produce pain, it also leads to\\nstress, which the body attempts to deal with by achieving\\nhomoeostatis. This process involves neural, hormonal,\\nand behavioural activities derived from genetically\\ndetermined repertoires. 9 These homoeostatic repertoires\\nexist at the injury site (cytokine release, for example), in\\nthe adrenal cortex (release of corticosteroids), the\\nimmune system, and in widely distributed areas in the\\nbrain.\\nComponents of pain\\nThe best definition of pain is that endorsed by the\\nInternational Association for the Study of Pain: “Pain is\\nan unpleasant sensory and emotional experience\\nassociated with actual or potential tissue damage, or\\ndescribed in terms of such damage”. 10 The existence of\\nmany types of pain can be understood by the\\nidentification of four broad categories: nociception,\\nperception of pain, suffering, and pain behaviours. 11\\nBehind each of these clinical categories are anatomical,\\nphysiological, and psychological substrates.\\nNociception—is the detection of tissue damage by\\nspecialised transducers attached to A delta and C fibres.\\nThese transducers may be biased by inflammatory and\\nneural changes in their immediate environment. Aspirin,\\nUntil the 1960s, pain was considered an inevitable sensory response to tissue damage. There was little room for the\\naffective dimension of this ubiquitous experience, and none whatsoever for the effects of genetic differences, past\\nexperience, anxiety, or expectation. In recent years, great advances have been made in our understanding of the\\nmechanisms that underlie pain and in the treatment of people who complain of pain. The roles of factors outside the\\npatient’s body have also been clarified. Pain is probably the most common symptomatic reason to seek medical\\nconsultation. All of us have headaches, burns, cuts, and other pains at some time during childhood and adult life.\\nIndividuals who undergo surgery are almost certain to have postoperative pain. Ageing is also associated with an\\nincreased likelihood of chronic pain. Health-care expenditures for chronic pain are enormous, rivalled only by the costs\\nof wage replacement and welfare programmes for those who do not work because of pain. Despite improved knowledge\\nof underlying mechanisms and better treatments, many people who have chronic pain receive inadequate care.\\nPain: an overview\\nJohn D Loeser, Ronald Melzack\\nPain\\n'),\n",

Local and\\nregional anaesthesia can prevent nociception from\\nbecoming pain, but so can downstream modulation, as\\nproposed in the Melzack-Wall theory.1 Such issues are\\nroutinely ignored by physicians.\\nPerception of pain— is frequently triggered by a noxious\\nstimulus, such as an injury or disease. Pain can also be\\ngenerated by lesions in the peripheral or central nervous\\nsystem, as seen in patients with diabetic neuropathy,\\nspinal-cord injury, or stroke. When acute pain occurs, it\\nis initially associated with specific autonomic and somatic\\nreflexes, but these disappear in patients with chronic\\npain. Many physicians and patients do not realise that\\npain can occur without nociception. Furthermore, pain\\ndue to nerve injury does not respond to analgesics such as\\nmorphine as efficiently as pain caused by tissue damage,\\nindicating the complex relation between injury and pain.\\nFinally, the intensity of chronic pain frequently bears\\nlittle or no relation to the extent of tissue injury of other\\nquantifiable pathology.\\nSuffering—is a negative response induced by pain and\\nalso by fear, anxiety, stress, loss of loved objects, and\\nother psychological states. The language of pain is used\\nto describe suffering, irrespective of the cause, and thus\\nmisleads both the doctor and the patient as to the basis of\\nthe suffering. As stated by Cassell, 12 “Suffering occurs\\nwhen the physical or psychological integrity of the person\\nis threatened”. Not all suffering is caused by pain, but in\\nour medicalised culture we describe suffering in the\\nlanguage of pain.\\nPain behaviours—result from pain and suffering and are\\nthe things a person does or does not do that can be\\nascribed to the presence of tissue damage. Examples of\\npain behaviours include saying “ouch”, grimacing,\\nlimping, lying down, recourse to health care, refusing to\\nwork. Such behaviour is observable by others and can be\\nquantified. All these behaviours are real and are also\\nprobably influenced by actual or expected environmental\\nconsequences. From pain behaviours and the history\\nand physical examination, we infer the existence of\\nnociception, pain, and suffering.\\nTypes of pain\\nTransient pain—is elicited by the activation of nociceptive\\ntransducers in skin or other tissues of the body in the\\nabsence of any tissue damage. The function of such pain\\nto the individual is related to its speed of onset after\\nstimulation is applied and the speed of offset that\\nindicates that the offending physical disturbance is no\\nlonger impinging upon the body. Presumably, transient\\npain evolved to protect man from physical damage by the\\nenvironment or by over stress of the body tissues. This\\ntype of pain is ubiquitous in everyday life and is rarely a\\nreason to seek health care. In the clinical setting, transient\\npain is seen only in incidental or procedural pain, such as\\nduring a venepuncture or injection for immunisation.\\nAlthough the prevention of procedural pain is worthy of\\nstudy, it is not a major issue in clinical medicine.\\nHowever, transient pain, which was the subject of most of\\nthe physiological experimentation during the first 75\\nyears of this century, remains the common conceptual\\nmodel in health care.\\nAcute pain—is elicited by substantial injury of body tissue\\nand activation of nociceptive transducers at the site of\\nlocal tissue damage.

The local injury does not overwhelm the body’s\\nreparative mechanisms: “healing” can occur without\\nmedical intervention. The report of pain stops long\\nbefore healing has been completed. However, medical\\ninterventions may be useful in two respects: to prevent or\\nreduce pain and to speed up the healing process by\\nshortening the duration of the injury. Most individuals\\nwith acute pain seek medical care. This type of pain is\\nalso seen after trauma, surgical interventions, and some\\ndiseases. Since the healing process usually takes a few\\ndays or a few weeks, pain that persists for months or years\\nis not classified as acute. However, in malignant diseases\\nthe invasion of body tissues can produce continuous\\nacute pain.\\nChronic pains —such as low back pain, postherpetic\\nneuralgia, and fibromyalgia, are commonly triggered by\\nan injury or disease, but may be perpetuated by factors\\nother than the cause of the pain. The injury may exceed\\nthe body’s capability for healing, because of the loss of\\nthe body part, the extensiveness of the trauma and\\nsubsequent scarring, or the involvement of the nervous\\nsystem in the injury itself. The nervous system may be\\ndamaged by the original injury in such a way as to be\\nunable to restore itself to a normal state. In addition to\\nchronic pain syndromes, in which the intensity of the pain\\nis out of proportion to the original injury or tissue\\ndamage, other syndromes may occur spontaneously in the\\nabsence of any sign of injury. All types of chronic pain\\nlead people to seek health care, but they are often not\\ntreated effectively. Because chronic pain is unrelenting, it\\nis likely that stress, environmental, and affective factors\\nmay be superimposed on the original damaged tissue and\\ncontribute to the intensity and persistence of the pain.\\nChronic pain differs from acute pain because therapies\\nthat provide only transient pain relief do not resolve the\\nunderlying pathological process. Chronic pain will\\ncontinue when treatment stops. Since the cause of a\\nperson’s perception of pain may persist irrespective of\\nmedical treatments, psychological forms of therapy such\\nas cognitive and behavioural treatments can be used to\\nalter the effect of the pain on the individual’s life. It is\\npossible that, just as the brain is modified by experience,\\nespecially in early life, the brain may be capable of\\naltering the way pain-producing information is processed\\nto keep its impact to a minimum. 13 It is not the duration\\nof pain that distinguishes acute from chronic pain but,\\nmore importantly, the inability of the body to restore its\\nphysiological functions to normal homoeostatic levels.\\nConclusions\\nThe brain contains widely distributed neural networks\\nthat create an image of self through genetic programmes\\nand memories of past experience. Afferent inputs act on\\nthis neuromatrix and produce output patterns that lead to\\nthe report of pain. Stress can change the interactions\\nbetween the neuromatrix and peripheral stimuli, as can\\nlearned experiences and expectations. Clinically\\nsignificant acute pain always involves issue damage; the\\ncentral and peripheral nervous systems are dynamic, not\\nstatic, and are modulated by tissue damage and by\\nchanges in the central nervous system and stress-\\nregulation systems that occur in response to such\\ndamage. Although most of these modulations are of short\\nduration, some may persist and lead to chronic pain\\nstates. In both clinical and basic research, we are rapidly\\ngaining useful information that will lead to more effective\\ncare for those who suffer pain.\\nReferences\\n1 Melzack R, Wall PD.

The old view was that \\nstressful conditions have a depressing effect on immunity. \\nHowever, the gathered evidence points towards a more \\nnuanced vision: stress can both increase and decrease \\nthe bodily defenses, depending on a diversity of factors \\nsuch as the duration of the stressful condition or the \\nindividual’s reaction thereto or perception thereof. Various \\nways of adapting to the stressful condition may have \\nvastly different repercussions on immunity.  \\nConfronted with a stressful condition, the organism \\nstrives to cope. For millennia, the most often encountered \\nstressors have been the pathogens attempting to \\npenetrate the organism. Therefore, the mechanisms \\nintended to have an adaptive function were evolutionarily \\ndesigned for the confrontation with these intruders: \\nstructures that either bar their entry, or track them down \\nand destroy them. The two main systems at work in this \\nadaptive process are the nervous system (especially the \\nbrain) and the immune system. While reacting to a \\ntrespasser, there is a continuous interchange of message \\nbetween these two systems in the attempt to keep the \\norganism in balance and free of infecting organisms. The \\nmechanisms responsible for the mediations of these \\ninteractions are both neuroendocrine and autonomic and \\nform the object of a relatively new discipline: \\npsychoneuroimmunology. As the name may suggest, the \\ninteractions it deals with are bidirectional: not only do the \\npsychic alterations translate into immune changes, but \\nalso products of the immune cells influence neuronal \\ncircuits. The major pathways involved in these interactions \\nare the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the \\nsympathetic nervous system (SNS). \\nOne of the key mediators is probably corticotrophin-\\nreleasing hormone (CRH), which exerts a general \\nimmunosuppressive influence by enhancing the release of \\ncorticosteroids, catecholamines, and certain opiates \\nthrough its action on the sympatho-adrenergic system. \\nThe release of CRH from the hypothalamus is modulated \\nby behavioral, nervous, and neuroendocrine influences. \\nStress also modifies the secretion of growth hormone and \\n © 2010, Carol Davila University Foundation '),\n",

This change in dominance is exerted by both \\nstimulating the activity of Th-2 cells and inhibiting the \\nfunction of antigen-presenting cells and Th-1 cells. We \\nmay see this as an attempt to limit the deleterious effects \\nof a non-specific defense reaction, while encouraging a \\nmore specific response confined to the aggressor. \\nTherefore, under adrenergic stimulation, the defense \\nreaction shifts from a general systemic inflammatory one \\nto a specific localized long-term protective one. In order to \\nachieve this, the systemic release of proinflammatory \\ncytokines (IL-1, TNF- α, and interferon- γ) is shut down, \\nwhile that of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-\\nβ) is stimulated. The proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, \\nTNF-α, and primarily IL-8) might still be released in the \\ninvaded/ injured region calling for neutrophil accumulation. \\nThe outcome of infectious disease is altered by the \\nchronic exposure to stress [ 5, 6]. Long-term immune \\nchanges are one of the possible pathways through which \\nchronic stress enhances the vulnerability to infectious, \\nneoplastic, and autoimmune disease [7]. The chronic \\nstress-related increased susc eptibility to disease is \\nattributable to perturbed homeostatic mechanisms – the \\nterm \"allostatic load\" was created in order to underline the \\nidea that long-lasting adversity is apt to lead the bodily \\nneurochemical activity away from its normal equilibrium \\n(homeostatic) position, with persistent (or even \\npermanent) negative impact on health [8]. \\nOne of the many forms of chronic stress is sleep \\ndeprivation, which was proven to interfere with the \\nimmune processes, altering the function of NK cells, the \\ncytokine production, and the humoral immune responses \\nto vaccination [9, 10, 11]. \\nAltered endocrine mechanisms or maladaptive \\nhealth practices could serve as a link between stress and \\nimpaired immunity [ 12, 13]. When the environmental \\nchallenges exceed the organism’s coping ability, major \\nendocrine systems are activated, especially the \\nsympathetic-adrenal medullary (SAM) system (including \\nthe SNS and the adrenal me dulla) and the HPA system, \\nwith a resultant activation of the receptors for cortisol and \\ncatecholamines on the leukocytes. This alters cellular \\ntrafficking, proliferation and differentiation, and cytokine \\nproduction [14]. \\nThe defense mechanisms encompass several \\nsystems, all of which are influenced by stress. These \\nsystems may be broadly divided into the innate immune \\nsystem (including components such as the proteins \\nsecreted at mucosal surfaces and the cells involved in \\nkilling the bacteria) and the adaptive immune system, \\nwhich has a more specific action and includes antibody \\nproduction. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on Epithelial Surfaces Protection \\nThe pathogens invasion implies the penetration of \\nepithelial barriers: mucous membranes or skin. The skin’s \\nprotective mechanisms rely heavily on its thickness \\n(mechanical protection). By contrast mucous membranes \\ncannot be thick, given the secretion and/or absorption \\nprocesses that are supposed to take place at their \\nsurface. Therefore, other protective mechanisms have \\nbeen developed: certain proteins with more (S-IgA) or less \\n(various secretory proteins) specific protective action \\n(biological protection). All these protective mechanisms, \\nboth mechanical and biological, are influenced by stress. \\nSkin serves as a barrier to prevent the entry of \\npathogens. It was shown that the recovery of the skin’s \\nintegrity is delayed in subjects exposed to acute stress \\n[15, 16, 17]. This is in concordance with the protracted \\nhealing of wounds after short- and long-term psychological \\nstress [ 18, 19]. The slow resolution of skin injuries is \\nattributed to stress-induced neural, endocrine and immune \\nalterations: activation of immune and inflammatory \\nprocesses in the skin, neuropeptide release from the \\nperipheral nerves, and increased systemic glucocorticoid \\nlevels [16]. These neural, endocrine and immune changes \\ninterfere with processes such as lipid synthesis and \\ncytokine expression, important in the initial phases of \\nwound healing [16, 20]. Research done on animal models \\nproved the involvement of glucocorticoids [ 21, 22] and of \\nβ-adrenergic agonists in the delayed skin recovery from \\ninjury [23]. \\nA wide range of secretory proteins protect the \\nmucosal surfaces: some pertain to the (secretory) \\nadaptive immune system, other s to the innate one. The \\nsecretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) is a member of the \\nadaptive secretory immune system. Its secretion is \\ncontrolled by neuroendocrine factors and is consequently \\ninfluenced by stress [2]. The duration of the stressful \\nsituation is particularly important: acute stress enhances \\nS-IgA levels, in contrast to prolonged stress, which \\ndiminishes S-IgA levels [24]. \\nThe secretory proteins with antimicrobial activity are \\npart of the innate immune system and act as a first line, \\nnonspecific protective mechanism. They are produced by \\nthe exocrine glands lining the mucous membranes of the \\ndigestive, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. Their release \\nis controlled by the neuroendocrine system, which \\nprovides the means through which psychosocial stress \\nmay exert its influence. It was proven that the secretion of \\nsalivary proteins (such as cystatin S, lactoferrin, α-\\namylase, the mucins MUC5B and MUC7) is increased by \\nstressful situations, not only by those requiring an active \\nattitude (with predominantly sympathetic activation), but \\neven more by those inducing a passive one (in which the \\nvagal tone is predominantly increased). The pattern of \\nproteins is also different: only MUC7, lactoferrin, and α-\\namylase are increased when the sympathetic stimulation \\n 11© 2010, Carol Davila University Foundation '),\n",

This stress-induced \\nchange in the pattern and the quantity of salivary proteins \\nmay partially explain the way stress alters the \\nsusceptibility to infectious diseases [25]. This might have a \\nconsiderable importance, since circumventing this first line \\nof defense seems to be decisive in initiating an infectious \\ndisease.  \\nThe occurrence of an infectious disease can be \\ndivided into two distinct phases: the infection (which refers \\nto the microorganisms gaining access into the system), \\nand the disease itself. The increased rate of infectious \\ndiseases in stressed individuals seems to be related \\nprimarily to an alteration of the first of these two phases: \\npsychosocial stress mainly increases the proportion of \\ninfected persons, rather than the progression of infection \\nto clinical disease [ 26]. The role of the secretory proteins \\nis to prevent the infection; hence they are relevant in the \\nassessment of the stress-related increase in the \\npredisposition to infectious diseases. Protein secretion is \\nprimarily controlled by the SNS through β-adrenergic \\npathways.  \\nThe effect of usual stressful factors on secretory \\nimmunity may be prolonged, lasting considerably more \\nthan the actual stressful situations. The exposure to acute \\nstress increases mucin secretion in the digestive and \\nrespiratory tracts [27, 28], which should enhance mucosal \\nbarrier function. This may appear paradoxical given the \\nincreased rate of infection in individuals subjected to acute \\nstress [ 25]. One explanation may be the adaptive \\nmechanisms developed by the infecting organisms, \\nallowing them to take advantage of the increased protein \\nsecretion [29]. One example is Helicobacter pylori; whose \\nability to bind certain types of mucin proteins enhances \\nthe organism’s potential to invade the host. It has been \\nproven that under stressful circumstances, the increased \\nsecretion of MUC5B promotes the adherence of H. pylori \\n[27].  \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on the Cellular Immunity \\nAcute stress accelerates both the resolution of an \\ninfection [ 30, 31] and the healing of a wound [ 32], and \\nmay result in an increase in both cellular and humoral \\nimmunity [ 33, 34, 35]. The mediator of these protective \\nactions is, at least partially, the stress hormones-\\norchestrated mobilization of immune-cells [ 36, 37]. \\nLeukocyte redistribution is the mechanism designed to \\nprovide the adequate number of cells to the sites of \\ninvasion/ injury [36]. Chemotaxis and adhesion molecules \\nexpression are two critical processes in the recruitment \\nand migration of immune cells to inflammatory sites, \\npromoting the redeployment of leukocytes to places where \\nthey are most required in order to fight the potential \\naggressors. \\nImmune cells continuously patrol the organism in \\nthe quest for intruders. They cover long distances via the \\ncirculation, and then exit the blood vessels in various \\ntissues and organs where they exert their function. After a \\nlonger or shorter interval, they may reenter the blood \\nvessels and continue to traffic through the body. \\nPsychological stress may alter this pattern of circulation. \\nThis may have repercussions on the efficiency of the \\nprotective action belonging to the cellular branch of the \\ninnate immune system. By ac tivating the adrenergic \\nreceptors, the acute stress-induced SAM system \\nstimulation leads to an increase in immunoregulatory cell \\nnumber and function [ 38, 39, 40], aimed at increasing the \\ndefense ability (it seems sensible that the stress-exposed \\norganism should be more prepared for injury or invasion). \\nHowever, many researchers have found that the immune \\nresponse to acute stress in chronically stressed \\nindividuals is different from that in healthy persons [ 41], \\nsuggesting a disorder in the sympathetically mediated \\nprotective processes. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on the Macrophages  \\nCellular and humoral immune reactions heavily rely \\non macrophages, which are sensitive to stress. Stress \\naugments cytokine production, which may explain the \\nincrease in acute phase reactants through the induction of \\ntheir hepatic synthesis by cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6. \\nSubstance P is involved in the stress-induced changes in \\ncytokine levels and in the macrophage responses to \\nstress [42]. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on the NK Cells \\nAcute stress leads to an increase in the number of \\ncirculating NK cells [ 13, 38] by promoting their release \\nfrom various reservoirs [ 43]. In young subjects, there may \\nalso be an increase in NK cell activity [ 38]. In stressful \\ncircumstances the NK cells lining the walls of the blood \\nvessels leave their waiting position, enter the blood flow, \\nand circulate (through the mediation of various \\nchemoattractants, citokines and ligands) to the various \\nterritories were they are needed. The aim of these NK cell \\nmobilizations is to provide protection during acute stress. \\nOne of the factors mediating the effects of acute stress on \\nNK cell function is probably the SAM system, through \\nincreased levels of NE and/or epinephrine [44].  \\nThe cell-surface marker characteristic for NK cells is \\nCD56 (besides, NK cells do not express CD3). \\nFunctionally, there are at least two subsets of NK cells:  \\n• most of them exert a cytotoxic function and have \\na low surface density of CD56 (CD56 poor); these are \\nrich in CD11a adhesion molecules, whose ligands are \\nprofusely expressed on the endothelial cells close to \\nthe site of an inflammatory reaction; the high density of \\nCD16 on CD56poor NK cells is instrumental in their \\nability to identify cells coated with antibody inviting NK \\ncells to set free their destructive potential; \\n• the remainder, rich in CD56 (CD56 rich), release \\ncytokines, thereby modulating the function of the \\nimmune system is the major NK subtype found in the \\nperipheral lymph nodes. This happens due to a high \\ndensity of CD62L (L-selectin) adhesion molecules, \\nwhich promote the migration of lymphocytes into the \\n 12 © 2010, Carol Davila University Foundation '),\n",

The SNS activation is a \\ncrucial mediator of this process, and the amount of NK cell \\nmobilization parallels the magnitude of other \\nadrenergically mediated physiological changes [ 45, 46, \\n47, 48, 49]. It was proven that sympatho-adrenergic tone-\\nincreasing conditions (acute stressors, exercise, and \\ncatecholamine infusions) selectively increase the number \\nof CD56poor NK cells in the blood [ 50, 51, 52]. This may be \\nexplained by the catecholamine’ ability to decrease the \\nCD56 expression on the already circulating NK cells \\nand/or to preferentially mobilize the CD56rich NK cells. The \\nlatter hypothesis is better supported by current evidence, \\npointing to a selective mobilization of NK cells during \\nacute stress, according to differences in surface \\nexpression of adhesion molecules [ 50]. A likely \\nexplanation is a higher density and/or sensitivity of \\nadrenergic receptors, which induces a higher \\nresponsiveness to catecholamines [ 51]. Correlatively, \\nduring acute stress, the number of circulating CD16 -rich \\nin NK cells increases, thereby promoting the antibody-\\ndependent cytotoxicity [ 51]. On the other hand, chronic \\nstress results in a decline in NK cytotoxic activity [ 13]. \\nTherefore, stress seems to have at least some beneficial \\neffects, in the short run, on the immune function and on \\nhealth in general [ 36]. It is chronic stress that puts things \\nwrong. \\nThe number of adhesion molecules on the NK cells \\nchanges in acutely stressful situations [ 50, 53, 54, 55]. \\nAcute stressors down-regulate the expression of CD62L \\non circulating NK cells, while increasing the density of \\nCD11a. Similar changes are induced by strenuous \\nexercise or by pharmacologic stimulation of β-adrenergic \\nreceptors [ 52]. Beta-blockade has opposing effects [ 52, \\n55]. We may conclude that stress-induced changes in \\nadhesion molecule densities on circulating NK cells may \\nbe largely attributed to adrenergic hyperactivity. \\nConversely, chronic stress reduces the NK cell \\nresponsiveness to cytokines [ 56], with a drop in the NK \\ncell activity, in contrast to t he increased activity in normal \\nindividuals subjected to an acute stress. NE may be one \\nof the factors mediating this effect, which was shown to \\nreduce NK cytotoxic capacity in vitro [57]. Exposure to \\nchronic stress results in a decre ased NK cell ability to kill \\ntarget cells [ 13], and diminished response to recombine \\ninterferon gamma [ 58], which may partially explain the \\nchronic stress associated morbidity, as impaired NK \\nfunction correlates with the development or progression of \\nviral, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases. However, the \\nimmune cell functional capacity recovers relatively quickly: \\nit begins within 1 month and is substantial within 1 to 3 \\nmonths after the conclusion of the overtaxing situation \\n[59]. Of course, this holds as long as no other major stress \\nsupervenes in the next few months. \\nIf exposed to an acute psychological challenge, \\nchronically stressed individuals have a protracted decline \\nin NK cell activity [ 41] and a more pronounced \\nredistribution of NK cells. Normally, acute stress is \\nassociated with a hormonal upsurge in the SAM, HPA and \\nendorphin systems. In individuals previously exposed to \\nchronic stress, these acute stress-induced changes are \\naltered, with an excessive adrenergic response and a \\nblunted β-endorphinic one [41]. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on the T lymphocytes \\nA brief exposure to stress increases the number of \\ncirculating CD8 suppressor/cytotoxic T cells [ 38]. In \\nhealthy individuals acute stress induces not only \\nlymphocytosis, but also a greater increase in \\nCD8(+)CD62L(-) T cells compared to CD8(+)CD62L(+) T \\ncells. This change may be partially prevented by prior \\ntreatment with the nonselective β-antagonist propranolol, \\nbut not by the β1 selective antagonist metoprolol [ 60]. In \\ncontrast, chronically stressed individuals have a drop in \\nthe percentage of circulating CD62L(-) T lymphocytes [61], \\nwhich is associated with a decrease in the sensitivity and \\ndensity of the β2-adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes \\n[62] and therefore, a drop in the sympatho-adrenergic \\ndriven stimulation of immune cells. This may have \\nconsequences on the immune cells ’ readiness to mobilize \\nand migrate in response to acute stressors and implicitly \\non the organism’s ability to defend itself. \\nChronic stress decreases the lymphocyte \\nproliferative ability in response to mitogens [ 63], to lectins, \\nand to T-cell receptor activation [ 58]. It may also diminish \\nthe percentages of total T lymphocytes and of Th \\nlymphocytes, and it may increase antibody titers to \\nEpstein-Barr virus (as a consequence of the cellular \\nimmune system’s inability to control the latent virus) [64]. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on Chemotaxis  \\nNormally, there is an increase in chemotaxis [ 65] in \\nresponse to acute stress. However, in chronically stressed \\npersons, the response to typical chemotactic agents is \\nmarkedly reduced after exposure to an acute stress [66]. \\nIn healthy persons, epinephrine has an inhibitory effect on \\nchemotaxis in normal circumstances, but a stimulatory \\none in response to acute stress, putting the organism in a \\nbetter position to oppose pathogens. The opposite seems \\nto be the case of individuals exposed to long-lasting \\nstress: usually the chemotactic capacity develops parallel \\nto the level of adrenergic activation, but the relation is \\nreversed in acutely stressful situations. In other words, \\nchemotaxis is active when it is needed in normal persons, \\nin contrast to chronically stressed individuals, where \\nchemotaxis fails when it is most needed and improves \\notherwise. Therefore, in persons exposed to chronic \\nstress, lymphocytes no longer exert their protective role \\nwhen necessary; instead they may induce pathological \\n 13© 2010, Carol Davila University Foundation '),\n",

The expression of Mac-1 on lymphocytes is \\nincreased during acute psychological stress [65], while the \\nexpression of L-selectin (CD62L) is decreased [ 67, 50]. \\nCorrespondingly, the catecholamine levels are positively \\nassociated with Mac-1 expression on lymphocytes and \\nnegatively associated with L-selectin (CD62L) expression. \\nLFA-1 is a leukocyte integrin, involved in the recruitment \\nto the site of infection, functioning as an adhesion \\nmolecule. The infusion of a β-adrenergic agonist (such as \\nisoproterenol) increases LFA-1 expression on \\nlymphocytes [68], and so does psychological stress [67, \\n50], while β-blocking agents (e.g. propranolol) are known \\nto reverse this  response [ 55]. Hence, there is a general \\nagreement that the changes in adhesion molecules \\nexpression are due to sympatho-adrenergic activation. \\nHowever, besides the catecholamines, corticosteroids \\nalso seem to be involved in the stress-related changes in \\nleukocyte trafficking [33]. \\n \\nThe Effects of Stress on the Humoral Immunity \\nReceptors of glucocorticoids (including cortisol) and \\ncatecholamines (epinephrine and NE) are found on each \\nof the cell types associated with the primary and \\nsecondary antibody response. The increased plasma and \\ntissue concentrations of these hormones during stressful \\nconditions alter the function of these cells, and hence the \\nantibody production. High levels of stress lead to a \\ndecrement in the titers of protective antibodies against \\nvarious pathogens, such as influenza, hepatitis B, and \\npneumonia [ 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]. There is convincing \\nevidence about the impact of stress on the secondary \\nantibody response to immunizations, but less so, about \\nthe primary one. The feebleness of the evidence regarding \\nthe primary response may be due to an inappropriate \\ntiming of the assessment, as it is assumed that there are \\nsome critical moments when the antibody response might \\nbe most vulnerable to stress. There may also be a \\ndifference between the effects of long- and short-lasting \\nstress [12].  \\nIt is believed that there may be a critical period (the \\n10 days after the vaccine is administered) when stress is \\nmore apt to impair the antibody response [75]. Therefore, \\nit seems that the latter stages of the antibody production \\n(which involve cytokine production by activated T cells) \\nare more vulnerable to stress than the earlier stages. This \\nmay have therapeutic cons equences: psychological \\ninterventions are known to increase the humoral immune \\nresponses to vaccination [ 76] and they may be properly \\nscheduled so as to have a maximal impact during the \\nvulnerable period [77].  \\nChronic stress is associ ated with a diminished \\nantibody response to vaccines [ 12, 13]. This effect has \\nbeen most consistently documented in persons caring for \\na spouse incapacitated with dementia [ 70, 71, 78, 69, 74, \\n79]. A bleaker perspective on life might be responsible for \\nthis latter effect, as it has been proven that, besides \\nstress, depression is also detrimental to humoral immunity \\n[80]. Nevertheless, one should not forget the immune-\\nmodulating effects of genetic factors (such as cytokine \\ngene polymorphisms [80]).  \\nThe effect of acute stress on antibody production \\nseems to be less consistent (the impact on secretory \\nimmunoglobulin A production is better proven) and less \\ndurable (an association was found only when a tight timing \\nin the assessment of stress and antibody production was \\nobserved). Acute stress at the time of antigenic challenge \\naugments the antibody response to both thymus-\\nindependent and thymus-dependent vaccines, proving \\nthat stress-induced immune enhancement is not \\ndependent on T-cell involvement [81]. \\nCortisol is one of the pathways through which stress \\nalters the antibody response to a vaccine [ 82]. Stress-\\nincreased cortisol secretion is associated with a feeble \\nantibody response to vaccination [ 69, 83, 82]. Prolonged \\nstress chronically activates t he HPA axis with persistent \\nelevation of systemic glucocorticoids, which may put off \\nbalance the Th1/Th2 cytokine network by inhibiting \\ncytokine synthesis. The resultant immune disorders \\npredisposes to a wide range of diseases [ 84, 85, 86, 87]. \\nOther hormones (such as epinephrine and NE, prolactin, \\nand growth hormone) could also be involved in mediating \\nthe link between stress and secondary antibody response \\n[88].  \\nBesides the endocrine alterations, lifestyle changes \\n(alteration of alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, \\nphysical activity, and sleep) may act as mediators, linking \\nstress exposure to antibody response [ 3, 89]. Indeed, \\nsmoking, physical inactivity, and sleep deprivation are \\nknown to decrease antibody responses to vaccination [ 90, \\n9]. Altered sleep patterns also seem to be responsible for \\nthe impaired immune response following exposure to \\nstress [91, 92]. Sometimes, a vicious circle may arise, in \\nwhich sleep deprivation and feelings of stress promote \\neach other [75] to the detriment of humoral immunity. \\nPsychological interventions aimed at improving \\nstress coping abilities may improve the immune response \\nto vaccines [79]. \\nConclusions \\nBrief acute stressful situations have a stimulating \\neffect on immunity, associated with the general SAM \\nactivation, which promotes the redistribution of immune \\ncells from the blood to other organs in the body. However, \\nenduring stress, which is known to result in down-\\nregulation of β-adrenergic receptors, alters adhesion \\nmolecules expression on leukocytes, with a resultant \\ndecrease of immune response to acute psychological \\nchallenges in chronically stressed persons.  \\nIn contrast to acute stress, chronic stress impairs NK and \\nT cell function.  \\n 14 © 2010, Carol Davila University Foundation '),\n",

Behavioral or neurobiological \\nmechanisms might also be operational, as bad life habits \\n(smoking, alcohol consumption, insufficient sleep, poor \\ndiet etc.) have well-established repercussions on \\nimmunity.  \\nProper counseling and psychological support may \\nappease the deleterious effects of chronic stress, helping  \\n \\nexposed individuals to preserve the strength of their \\nimmune system. \\nIncreasingly, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) \\nis considered a key mediator, and norepinephrine (NE) is \\na serious candidate for the role of neurotransmitter/ \\nneuromodulator in the lymphoid organs [ 4]. There are \\nreceptors for catecholamines on the immune cells. The \\nincrease in the sympatho-adrenergic tone in response to a \\nstressor results in local and systemic changes is \\nrepresented by a release of NE from the nervous \\nterminals in the lymphoid organs, in association with \\nincreased circulating levels of epinephrine. Subjected to \\nthis adrenergic environment, the lymphocytes change their \\npattern of proliferation, circulation, and cytokine \\nproduction.  \\nReferences \\n \\n \\n1.

Shapiro2,* \\n1Surgery Resident; 2Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Head and N eck Surgery, David Geffen Sc hool of  \\nMedicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA \\nAbstract: Acute tonsillitis is an inflammatory process of the tonsillar tissues and is usually infectious in nature. Acute in-\\nfections of the palatine tonsils predominantly occur in school-aged children, but patients of any age may be affected. Ton-\\nsillitis of viral origin is usually treated with supportive care. Bacterial tonsillitis is most commonly caused by Streptococ-\\ncus pyogenes. Polymicrobial infections and viral pathogens are also important sources of infection. Penicillins remain the \\ntreatment of choice for S. pyogenes tonsillitis, and augmented aminopenici llins have gained utility in concert with the in-\\ncreasing incidence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria. We describe the anatomic features and the immunologic function \\nof the palatine tonsils, including a detailed discussion of history and physical examination findings, treatment recommen-\\ndations, and possible complications of acute tonsillitis. Establishing an accurate dia gnosis and initiating appropriate treat-\\nment are key components of managing this common pathologic process. \\nKeywords: Acute, infection, pediatric, tonsillitis. \\nINTRODUCTION \\n Diseases become increasingly important when they are \\ncommon, treatable, and have the potential for significant \\nlong-term morbidity. As a pathologic process, acute tonsilli-\\ntis demonstrates each of these characteristics. Primarily \\ntreated by pediatricians and primary care physicians, this \\ndisease process remains a common occurrence in the general \\npopulation. \\n This discussion outlines the anatomy, immunology, \\nvariations in pathology, and common complications of acute \\ntonsillitis. Acute tonsillitis refers to any inflammatory proc-\\ness involving the tonsillar tissues of the oropharynx. More \\ncommonly, and for the purposes of this discussion, this term \\nis used specifically to describe the infection and inflamma-\\ntion of the palatine tonsils. Acute tonsillitis occurs in school-\\naged children predominantly, affecting nearly all children at \\nleast once in their lifetime. The most common etiologic \\npathogens are bacterial, with Streptococcus pyogenes  con-\\ntributing heavily to the incidence of this disease process. \\nOther bacteria and viral agents are also known to produce \\nacute tonsillar inflammation, each with its own complement \\nof morbidities [1-3].  \\nANATOMY \\n The palatine tonsils are a component of Waldeyer’s ring, \\na circumferential array of secondary lymphoid tissue in the \\noropharynx that provides immunologic surveillance and pro-\\nduces immunoglobulin. The lingual tonsils, adenoids, and \\npalatine tonsils make up this ring, and the palatine tonsils are \\nthe largest of the three tissue groups [1, 4-7]. Located in the \\nlateral aspect of the oropharynx, each palatine tonsil lies in a \\nfossa bound by two pillars of pharyngeal muscle: the palato-\\npharyngeus posteriorly, and the palatoglossus anteriorly. The \\ntonsil itself is surrounded by a capsule of loose connective \\n \\n*Address correspondence to this author at the 62-158 CHS, Division of \\nHead and Neck Surgery, 10833 LeConte Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90095, \\nUSA; Tel: 310-825-2749; Fax: 310-206-7384; E-ma il: nshapiro@ucla.edu \\n \\ntissue which is intimately associated with the tonsillar paren-\\nchyma and loosely attached to the superior pharyngeal con-\\nstrictor fascia on the deep surface of the tonsil. \\n The nerve supply to the palatine tonsil is comprised of \\nsensory fibers from the tonsillar and pharyngeal plexuses, \\nwhich are derivatives of the glossopharyngeal nerve. An-\\nother glossopharyngeal nerve branch, the tympanic branch, \\nis indirectly associated with the tonsillar plexus, explaining \\nthe common occurrence of referred otalgia often seen during \\nacute tonsillitis or after tonsillectomy [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]. \\n The superior and inferior poles of the tonsil receive their \\nblood supply from branches of the external carotid artery. \\nThe superior pole is supplied by the ascending pharyngeal \\nand lesser palatine arteries. The inferior pole is supplied by \\nthe tonsillar branch of the dorsal lingual artery, the ascending \\npalatine artery, and the tonsillar branch of the facial artery. \\nVenous drainage occurs via the peritonsillar plexus, which \\ncommunicates with the lingual and pharyngeal veins, and \\nultimately empties into the internal jugular vein [1, 4, 6, 8]. \\nIMMUNOLOGY \\n The palatine tonsils are favorably located at the entrance \\nto the upper aerodigestive tract. Here, they are exposed to \\nvarious exogenous antigens, such as viruses, bacteria, and \\nfood particles. The parenchyma of the tonsil is composed of \\nantigen sampling M-cells, B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, \\nand plasma cells. The B-lymphocyte is the most abundant of \\nthe palatine tonsil’s immune complement and is actively \\ninvolved in immunologic memory and antibody production \\n[1, 3, 6]. Memory B-cells are located in a region of secon-\\ndary lymphoid tissue called the germinal center. Here, B-\\ncells that have been activated by antigen exposure proliferate \\nand undergo specific immunologic processes designed to \\nenhance the acquired immune response [1, 3]. Surrounding \\nthe germinal center is the mantle zone, composed of mature \\nB-cells. Together, the region defined by the germinal center \\nand mantle zone is termed the lymphoid follicle, and it is \\nsurrounded by T-cells in the extrafollicular area [3, 4].

Instead, the epithelium-lined tonsillar crypts func-\\ntion to trap exogenous material and transfer these antigens to \\nthe immunologically active lymphocytes [1, 4, 6, 10]. \\n It is thought that the immunologic surveillance and activ-\\nity of the tonsils peaks in early childhood, commonly before \\nage 10. After this period, involution of the tonsil takes place, \\nand a fluctuation in the ratio of T and B cells ensues. As a \\nresult, much debate has existed historically regarding the \\nconsequence of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the pe-\\ndiatric population [1]. Histologically, regression of the ton-\\nsils is associated with a decline in lymphatic tissue as it is \\nreplaced by fibrinous tissue [11, 12]. \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \\n The characteristics of the physical examination are not \\nspecific or unique to the patient with acute tonsillar disease. \\nThe palatine tonsils are often easily visualized in the pediat-\\nric patient using a tongue depressor to steadily depress the \\nposterior oral tongue. In contrast, the palatine tonsil may be \\nless evident in the adult patient secondary to involution; \\nhowever, the tonsillar pillars should remain visible. A grad-\\ning system exists that allows the physician to document ton-\\nsil size with some degree of objectivity by quantifying the \\npercentage of the tonsil that lies outside the tonsillar fossa [1, \\n8] Fig (1). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig (1).

Am ., 1989, \\n36(6), 1551-1569). \\n The clinical presentation of acute tonsillitis varies based \\non etiology, most commonly presenting with fever, odyn-\\nophagia, dysphagia, and tonsillar erythema. Physical exami-\\nnation characteristics specific to each disease process are \\nreviewed in the following sections.  \\nACUTE BACTERIAL TONSILLITIS \\n The human oropharynx is host to myriad resident bacte-\\nria, including Streptococcus pneumonia,  Haemophilus influ-\\nenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis , in addition to Propioni-\\nbacterium, Nocardia, and Fusobacterium [1, 6, 13].  The \\nprevalence of oropharyngeal bacterial colonization is thought \\nto fluctuate with the onset of an acute viral infection, and \\nvaries among individuals [1, 2]. The natural history of an \\nacute bacterial infection usually involves the obstruction or \\ninflammation of tonsillar crypts. Subsequent accumulation of \\ncrypt debris allows bacterial flora to multiply, causing leu-\\nkocytic exudates, inflammation, and erythema. \\n Acute bacterial tonsillitis is often preceded by a viral \\ninfection and is commonly polymicrobial, composed of ex-\\nogenous and resident flora [1-3, 13].  Streptococcus pyogenes  \\nis considered to be the most common single organism asso-\\nciated with bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis [1-3, 6, 11, \\n12]. This organism is a known precursor to rheumatic fever, \\nwhich occurs secondary to an autoimmune response. Recog-\\nnition of this association has led to a dramatic decline in the \\nincidence of rheumatic fever in the United States [1, 14, 15].  \\nIt has been suggested that all previously-infected tonsils have \\nsome amount of S. pyogenes  present at the time of tonsillec-\\ntomy despite the presence or absence of signs of acute infec-\\ntion. This is possibly due in part to a decreased clearance of \\nbacteria from the tonsillar stroma. Surface proteins on S. \\npyogenes, which resist tonsillar clearance, have been demon-\\nstrated on an animal model. Accordingly, approximately 20-\\n40% of 5- to 12-year-old patients have positive cultures \\nwithout exhibiting evidence of active disease [3]. \\n Despite the probability of low-grade colonization by S. \\npyogenes, active infection of the tonsils is a separate and \\ndistinct clinical process that warrants appropriate treatment. \\nCommon signs and symptoms on presentation include exu-\\ndative inflamed tonsils in conjunction with fever, dysphagia, \\nodynophagia, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy [1, 4, 6] \\nFig ( 2). Current primary care literature supports the treat-\\nment of presumed group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal \\n(GABHS) tonsillitis based on the presence of these criteria \\nalone [16]. Common practice, however, often includes throat \\nculture with or without rapid streptococcal antigen testing, \\nregardless of the presence or absence of these clinical criteria \\n[17]. Although results of pharyngeal cultures can take up to \\n48 hours to obtain, the tests are highly sensitive. In contrast, \\nrapid streptococcal detection kits are available, which pro-\\nvide an acceptable level of specificity, although sensitivity is \\nsub-optimal. When used appropriately, however, these tests \\nserve as a useful adjunct by which S. pyogenes tonsillitis can \\nbe diagnosed in some patients. A negative test in the pres-\\nence of clinical suspicion can be followed by a culture, with-\\nholding antibiotics until results are obtained. Physical ex-\\namination findings consistent with acute bacterial tonsillitis \\nare a necessary component of the diagnosis, as the presence \\n'),\n",

In contrast, chronic \\ninflammation is characterized by enlarged and activated \\ngerminal centers, with a marked increase in IgG production. \\nCrypts are distended, often containing debris, bacteria and \\noccasionally calcification (tonsillithiasis) [1, 11]. \\n Penicillin is the treatment of choice for S. pyogenes  ton-\\nsillitis; however, the increased incidence of beta-lactamase \\nproducing bacteria may warrant a change of antibiotic cover-\\nage in the face of persistent symptoms. An antibiotic such as \\namoxicillin with clavulanic acid is appropriate under these \\ncircumstances. Penicillin-allergic patients may be treated \\nwith clindamycin. Those patients who, despite appropriate \\ntreatment, continue to have recurrent infection, may benefit \\nfrom tonsillectomy. \\nACUTE VIRAL TONSILLITIS \\n Viral tonsillitis is similar to its bacterial counterpart. \\nDysphagia, fever, odynophagia, and tonsillar erythema are \\ncommon upon presentation [1, 6, 8]. Viral pathogens fre-\\nquently contributing to acute tonsillitis include the Epstein-\\nBarr virus (EBV), rhinovirus, enterovirus , influenza , and \\nadenovirus [1, 6, 10, 18-20]. Many viruses implicated in \\nacute tonsillitis are normal oropharyngeal flora. In contrast \\nto bacterial tonsillitis, rarely do viral pathogens result in an \\nexudative tonsillitis [1, 6, 8, 21]. \\n EBV tonsillitis is a frequently discussed etiologic agent \\nassociated with viral tonsillitis. EBV is known to colonize \\nthe tonsils of healthy individuals, with a 28% detection rate \\nin one study [18, 22, 23]. EBV is thought to remain latent in \\nthe B-lymphocytes of germinal centers, interacting to pro-\\nduce the infected M-cells found in the extrafollicular area \\n[20]. Part of the syndrome known as mononucleosis, EBV is \\nalso known to produce enlarged tonsils with a gray discol-\\noration in association with palatal petechia, fever, posterior \\ncervical lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and fatigue \\n[1, 6, 10, 18, 20, 22]. In conjunction with physical exam \\nfindings, a diagnosis is made via serology, which includes \\nthe heterophile antibody test and complete blood count with \\nmanual differential. A differential representing 50% lym-\\nphocytes with 10% atypical lymphocytes (activated T-cells) \\nis supportive of a diagnosis.  Fewer than 60% of patients have \\na positive test within the first two weeks of illness [1, 8, 10, \\n18]. Appropriate clinical suspicion and accurate diagnosis \\nare crucial. Due to the association of hepatosplenomegaly \\nwith the mononucleosis syndrome, patients must be cau-\\ntioned to avoid contact sports during their illness, as they \\nhave the potential to sustain a splenic rupture. Treatment is \\nlargely supportive, consisting of precautionary guidance, \\nfluid resuscitation, and rest. Tonsillar enlargement may be \\nsignificant and has the potential to cause acute airway ob-\\nstruction requiring systemic steroids, and placement of a \\nnasopharyngeal or surgical airway (see “Airway obstruc-\\ntion”). \\n Lastly, amoxicillin-related antibiotics are known to cause \\nan immune-mediated rash when given to patients with \\nmononucleosis. Antibiotics are therefore avoided in patients \\nwith an established or suspected diagnosis of EBV tonsillitis \\n[1, 6, 8]. \\nOTHER ETIOLOGIC AGENTS \\n Less commonly, acute tonsillitis may arise secondary to \\nother etiologic agents, including the coxsackievirus; Corny-\\nbacterium diphtheria ; and sexually transmitted diseases such \\nas Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and Chlamydia trachomatis . \\nCoxsackievirus \\n Acute tonsillitis secondary to the coxsackievirus results \\nin vesicular lesions on the tonsillar surface, posterior pha-\\nryngeal wall, and the soft palate. Given the term herpangina, \\ncoxsackievirus tonsillitis is associated with dysphagia, odyn-\\nophagia, and high fevers. It may also represent a component \\nof hand, foot, and mouth syndrome, with associated vesicles \\non the palms and soles. Treatment is generally supportive \\nwith hydration, antipyretics, and analgesics [1, 2, 4, 8]. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig (2).

To-\\nday, approximately 200-300 cases per year are documented \\nin the United States, and a high level of suspicion is there-\\nfore required for diagnosis [1, 8, 24]. The organism is readily \\nidentifiable on culture, and Klebs-Loffler bacilli are identifi-\\nable by gram stain [1, 25]. On physical examination a thick, \\ngray exudative membrane is classically visualized. The \\nmembrane is friable and historically has been considered to \\npose a risk of dislodgement and airway obstruction if intuba-\\ntion is required. For this reason, tracheotomy is the recom-\\nmended means to secure an airway if justified by the clinical \\npresentation. Treatment is required, as distant end-organ \\ninjury may occur secondary to diphtheria exotoxin if not \\nmanaged appropriately [26]. Treatment consists of penicillin \\nas well as Diphtheria antitoxin, preferably within 48 hours of \\nsymptom onset. \\nNeisseria Gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia Trachomatis \\n Gonorrhea is one of the most frequent sexually transmit-\\nted bacterial infections reported in the United States. While \\noral-genital infections are predominantly transmitted via \\nsexual contact, maternal-fetal transmission during birth may \\nresult in systemic or ophthalmic infections. As a result, both \\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis  are rarely identified in \\nthe pediatric patient. Diagnosis of either etiologic agent \\ntherefore mandates the consideration of underlying sexual \\nabuse in this patient population. \\n Symptoms localized to the pharynx include mild pharyn-\\ngeal discomfort and dysphagia. Other symptoms incude \\nheadache, myalgias, arthralgias, dysgeusia, cervical lympha-\\ndenopathy, and nasal discharge. Diagnosis is often estab-\\nlished clinically, based on patient history and risk factor \\nstratification. Risk factors include recent known exposure to \\ngonorrhea and multiple sexual partners. Pharyngeal culture \\naimed specifically at detecting gonorrhea is routinely per-\\nformed despite the initiation of empiric antibiotic treatment. \\nImportantly, the gram-negative intracellular organism C. \\ntrachomatis is thought to have the ability to produce a simi-\\nlar pharyngeal infection and frequently coexists in the patient \\nwith pharyngeal gonorrhea. In contrast to gonorrhea, \\nchlamydial infections are rarely detected on pharyngeal cul-\\nture, despite evidence of systemic disease. As a result, treat-\\nment for both N. gonorrhoeae  and C. trachomatis  is recom-\\nmended. The treatment of choice therefore includes intra-\\nmuscular ceftriaxone in addition to either azithromycin or \\ndoxycycline [27, 28]. \\nTONSILLECTOMY \\n Surgical excision of the palatine tonsils remains one of \\nthe most common procedures performed in the United \\nStates. Recently-revised guidelines have been established so \\nas to supplement clinician judgment in the decision-making \\nprocess prior to tonsillectomy. These recommendations can \\nbe summarized to include: documented recurrent pharyngeal \\ninfections at a frequency of 7 episodes in one year, five epi-\\nsodes per year for two years, three episodes per year for \\nthree years, or recurrent infections with modifying factors. \\nModifying factors include a history of peritonsillar abscess, \\nmultiple antibiotic allergies, or the presence of periodic fe-\\nver, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) \\nsyndrome [29]. Previously described absolute indications for \\ntonsillectomy include tonsillar enlargement resulting in se-\\nvere dysphagia, cardiopulmonary strain, febrile convulsions, \\nor concern for neoplasia. \\nCOMPLICATIONS OF TONSILLITIS \\n The identification and appropriate treatment of acute ton-\\nsillitis are essential due to the multitude of sequelae that may \\narise in the untreated or unrecognized patient. \\nRheumatic Fever and Glomerulonephritis \\n GABHS tonsillitis has the potential to cause both rheu-\\nmatic fever as well as acute post-streptococcal glomeru-\\nlonephritis (PSGN). While the risk for rheumatic fever ap-\\nproaches zero with adequate treatment, PSGN is an unfortu-\\nnate possibility despite treatment and should be recognized \\nin the appropriate setting [30].  \\nPediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Asso-\\nciated With Streptococcal Infections \\n Obsessive-compulsive traits, anxiety disorders, and \\npathologic compulsive tics associated with streptococcal \\ntonsillitis and pharyngitis are increasingly being recognized \\nas a unified entity. The abrupt onset of symptoms generally \\noccurs within weeks of the pharyngeal or tonsillar infection, \\nand, by definition, is confined to the pediatric population. \\nTonsillectomy is considered a treatment option [30, 31]. \\nPeriodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, and \\nAdenopathy Syndrome \\n Similar to cyclic hematopoiesis, PFAPA is a periodic \\nfever syndrome predominantly diagnosed in children be-\\ntween two and six years of age, with a slight male predilec-\\ntion. The disease is characterized by sporadic inflammatory \\nreactions without known provocation. Febrile events (fre-\\nquently reaching or exceeding 40’C) are accompanied by \\none of the three cardinal symptoms, including pharyngitis, \\ncervical lymphadenitis, and oral aphthous ulcers. Abdominal \\npain is also frequently present [32, 33]. Diagnosis is made \\nbased on clinical criteria. Although studies exist that suggest \\na genetic origin, specific gene abnormalities have not been \\nidentified to date. Initial management requires a workup for \\nfever of unknown origin and the exclusion of alternative \\ndiagnoses, including cyclic neutropenia, malignancy, and \\ninfection. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, but \\nadenotonisllectomy has likewise been demonstrated to in-\\nduce remission and/or reduce the severity of episodes [33]. \\nAlthough sporadic reported cases occurring in adults exist, \\ninflammatory episodes become infrequent after ten years of \\nage [33, 34]. \\nAirway Obstruction \\n Acute tonsillar enlargement has the potential to cause \\nlife-threatening airway obstruction and should be treated \\nemergently. Non-surgical treatment options include intrave-\\nnous steroids, nasopharyngeal airway placement, heliox, and '),\n",

Numerous etiologies \\nexist and commonly include bacterial or viral agents. Each \\npathologic process carries a unique complement of symp-\\ntoms, physical exam findings, and treatment options. De-\\npending on the cause of tonsillar inflammation and infection, \\nmorbidity can be significant and can involve both local tis-\\nsues and distant organs. A thorough approach to the patient \\nwith acute tonsillitis involves an equally thorough under-\\nstanding of tonsillar anatomy, immunologic function, and \\nsusceptibility to infection. Accurate diagnosis and appropri-\\nate treatment are key components of managing this common \\npathologic process. \\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST \\n N Shapiro, MD – Consultant – ArthroCare ENT. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \\n None declared. \\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT OR FUNDING \\n None. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] Wiatrak, B.J.; Woolley, A.L.

Since the failure of the MVA85A vaccine 2 years ago, there have been no new tuberculosis vaccine candi-\\ndates entering clinical testing. The current status quo of the lengthy treatment duration and poor treatment\\noutcomes associated with MDR/XDR tuberculosis and with comorbidity of tuberculosis with human immuno-\\ndeﬁciency virus and noncommunicable diseases is unacceptable.

For extrap-\\nulmonary tuberculosis, sampling is dependent on the suspected\\nsite of disease and requires invasive procedures. Attempts to de-\\nvelop blood, urine, and breath-based tests have met with limited\\nsuccess, as they are lacking in sensitivity and speciﬁcity [7]. In\\n2010, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation\\nagainst the use of serological tests [8]. Several novel diagnostic\\ntechnologies are being explored with the aim of providing better\\npoint-of-care rapid tests for tuberculosis. They include nucleic\\nacid ampliﬁcation tests (NAATs), imaging, and the analysis of\\nvolatile organic compounds.\\nNucleic Acid Ampliﬁcation Tests\\nThe most advanced of the new tests, andﬁrst to the market, were\\nsimple methods for amplifying and detecting nucleic acids that\\ndo not need laboratory facilities orspecialist technical skills.\\nThey have the potential advantage of incorporating detection\\nof mutations predictive of drug resistance. The Xpert MTB/RIF\\nassay (Cepheid Inc) is an automated polymerase chain reaction–\\nbased test that can identifyMtb DNA in clinical specimens and\\ndetect rifampicin resistance. It has been widely rolled out globally\\nand evaluated extensively at all points of healthcare [9–17]. The\\ncurrent assay might miss up to 15%–30% of rifampicin rpoB\\ngene mutations that confer resistance. An optimized version of\\nthe Xpert MTB/RIF is being developed, and preliminary data\\nsuggest 10-fold higher sensitivity than the standard Xpert assay\\n[18]. The optimized version has improved the performance both\\nin terms of sensitivity for detection ofMtb and for the detection\\nof rifampicin resistance mutations that are missed by the current\\nassay. However, this optimized assay at this point has not been\\ntested in any human clinical context. In addition, the GeneXpert\\ntechnology is not really an optimized point-of-care assay and\\nrequires some technical training and equipment maintenance.\\nWhen used at the point of care, it also cannot perform in settings\\nrequiring high throughput.\\nTwo tuberculosis tests recently released to the market are descri-\\nbed in Table1. Evaluation of these devices is ongoing, and there is\\nas yet little published data regarding their clinical performance.\\nStudies on the Truenat MTB test (Molbio Diagnostics, India)\\n[19] undertaken in India found sensitivity and speciﬁcity to be\\nsimilar to that of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay [20, 21], whereas a\\nstudy using EasyNAT in Tanzania reported high speciﬁcity\\n(100%) and a sensitivity compared with culture of 66.7%,\\nwith 10% of smear-negative cases found to be positive [22]. A\\nstudy from China on the EasyNAT Diagnostic Kit (Ustar Bio-\\ntechnologies, China) [23] using processed sputum reported sen-\\nsitivity and speci ﬁcity of 84% and 98%, respectively. The\\nsensitivity in smear-negative cases was 60% [24]. There are sev-\\neral tests ready for evaluation, but not yet released into the mar-\\nket, and a fuller description of the tuberculosis NAAT product\\ndevelopment pipeline may be found in the 2014 UNITAID Tu-\\nberculosis Diagnostics Technology and Market Landscape Re-\\nport [25].\\nImaging\\nA number of imaging techniques can be used to gauge the ex-\\ntent of disease and to monitor treatment, and imaging remains\\na ﬁrst-line tool for investigating extrapulmonary manifestations\\nof the disease [26]. Chest radiography played a major role in re-\\nducing the prevalence of tuberculosis in Europe and North\\nAmerica in the 1950s and 1960s, with mobile radiograph units\\nused for mass screening of communities. The introduction of\\ndigital radiography has improved image quality and facilitates\\nthe storage and sharing of images and, if required, a second\\nopinion may be sought by remote (electronic) access. Compared\\nto ﬁlm-based radiographs, running costs are reduced and\\nreagent stockouts avoided, but the cost of buying/leasing and\\nmaintaining the equipment remains high.

Studies suggest that sensitivities\\nfrom automated readers can be similar to those obtained by\\neye but that speciﬁcity is reduced [27], aﬁnding conﬁrmed by\\nstudies in Africa [28, 29]. Alternative imaging technologies such\\nas magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and\\npositron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-\\nCT) may eventuallyﬁnd utility in the investigation of extrapul-\\nmonary disease [26].\\nPET-CT is another modality that is being explored for tuber-\\nculosis [19].Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulates in metabo-\\nlically active immune system cells and can serve as a marker\\nof tuberculosis-associated in ﬂammation. FDG PET-CT at 2\\nmonths has been shown in pilot studies to correlate with out-\\ncome in patients with conﬁrmed MDR tuberculosis [30]. How-\\never, as FDG accumulates in all metabolically active cells, it has\\nlow speciﬁcity as a diagnostic and is unable to distinguish be-\\ntween tuberculosis and other metabolically active lung processes\\nsuch as malignancy. New radioprobes for PET and single-\\nproton emission computed tomography are being developed\\nthat target not glucose metabolism but markers of tuberculo-\\nsis-speciﬁc pathology including tissue pH, hypoxia, tissue calci-\\nﬁcation [31], and inﬂammation [32, 33].\\nBreath Tests\\nVolatile organic compounds (VOC) and gases are produced by\\nMtb as byproducts of their metabolic processes, and their detec-\\ntion by analysis of breath or volatile compounds [34] emanating\\nfrom clinical specimens is being exploited for development of\\nbreath-based tests. The most sensitive detectors and those best\\nsuited to differentiating complex mixtures are olfactory systems\\nof mammals and insects [35]. Giant African pouched rats (Cri-\\ncetomys gambianus) have been trained to recognize the smell of\\nMtb-infected sputum [36]. When samples were exposed to ten\\ndifferent rats, 91% ofMtb smear-positive samples were detected\\n[37]. Attempts to mimic the rats using electronic and chromato-\\ngraphic methods have so far been disappointing. E-nose techno-\\nlogies that showed early promise were found to be unreliable\\n[38]. Developers of a chromatographic-based breath test have\\nreported sensitivities and speciﬁcities of 71% and 72%, respec-\\ntively, when comparing untreated tuberculosis patients against\\nnonsymptomatic individuals [38].\\nE-health\\nA feature shared by many of the new diagnostic devices is the\\ncapacity to transmit data via wireless or cell phone technology\\nto an external database. The ability to store, retrieve, and share\\ndata in a central repository offers considerable logistic advan-\\ntages for health providers and may facilitate an improved ser-\\nvice for patients. However, as presented in Table2, there are a\\nnumber of concerns to be addressed about this new and cur-\\nrently unregulated technology. It is as yet unclear who shall\\nown the data, and for what purposes it would be used. A second,\\nand pressing issue, is compatibility and standardization of data\\nhandling storage and systems, because if manufacturers choose\\nto adopt different systems, the potential beneﬁts of e-health to\\nthe patient and the health provider will be diluted.\\nNEW TUBERCULOSIS DRUGS, REPURPOSED\\nDRUGS, AND TREATMENT REGIMENS\\nAdvances in new and repurposed drugs continuously update\\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for use in de-\\nsigning treatment regimens for MDR and XDR tuberculosis.\\nFigure 1 illustrates tuberculosis drug development over time.\\nRecent attention has focused on development of the new\\nTable 2.

Recent phase 2 clinical trials of sutezolid\\n(NCT01225640) assessing safety and efﬁcacy using early bacter-\\nicidal activity (EBA) and whole-blood bactericidal activity were\\ncompleted [45] (Table3). Tedizolid, recently approved by the\\nUS Food and Drug Administration for skin and skin structure\\ninfections, has shown activity in vitro againstMtb [61], but no\\nstudies inMtb-infected humans has been performed.

The Rapid Evaluation of Moxiﬂox-\\nacin in Tuberculosis (REMoxTB) study was a randomized, dou-\\nble-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating 2 regimens in\\nwhich either ethambutol or isoniazid was substituted by moxi-\\nﬂoxacin in a single 4-month combination therapy [84]. The\\nOﬂoxacine-Containing, Short-Course Regimen for the Treat-\\nment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis trial [85, 86] evaluated a stan-\\ndard 6-month regimen that included ethambutol during the\\n2-month intensive phase against a 4-month regimen in which\\nethambutol was substituted with gatiﬂoxacin during the inten-\\nsive phase and continued, along with rifampicin and isoniazid,\\nduring the continuation phase. The High-Dose Rifapentine\\nwith Moxiﬂoxacin for Pulmonary Tuberculosis trial [87] evalu-\\nated 2 regimens in which moxiﬂoxacin replaced isoniazid in an\\nintensive phase. Although these results have been disappoint-\\ning, ongoing combination regimens in phase 3 clinical trials\\nusing existing, repurposed, and new drugs, together with devel-\\nopments in adjunct host-directed therapies, provide hope for\\nincreasing therapeutic efﬁcacy; shortening treatment duration\\nand improving treatment outcomes for drug-susceptible and\\ndrug-resistant tuberculosis remain global priorities. Rifapentine\\nand clofazimine and high-dose rifampicin are under investiga-\\ntion for treatment-shortening regimens of drug-susceptible tu-\\nberculosis, not just for MDR and XDR tuberculosis.\\nDesign and selection of future experimental regimens will need to\\nincorporate a triage process so that accelerated evaluation of treat-\\nment-shortening regimens can be achieved. Whereas the recent\\nphase 3ﬂuoroquinolone trials have pointed to the difﬁculty of pre-\\ndicting successful 4-month regimens using existing biomarkers, an\\nalternative strategy uses novel trial designs looking at clinically rele-\\nvant outcomes as an alternative to biomarkers for screening new\\ndrugs or drug combinations. Viable approaches include the multi-\\narm, multistage trial design and other adaptive trial designs [88].\\nWhile optimal drug treatment regimens are developed, even if\\nthey are made up of fewer drugs and are for a shorter duration, it\\nwill be critical that adherence to full-course chemotherapy is mon-\\nitored to minimize the generation of drug resistance.\\nTUBERCULOSIS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe universal hope that by 2015 a candidate vaccine that would\\nbe able, at least partially, to boost protection induced by BCG\\nalone would become available from the existing pipeline [89]\\nhas not materialized. The failure of the MV A85A vaccine to\\ndemonstrate any improvement over BCG in an infant efﬁcacy\\ntrial [90] has led to reluctance by funders to invest in further\\ntuberculosis vaccine ef ﬁcacy trials, and the effectiveness of\\nother vaccines in clinical development has been brought\\nunder close scrutiny [91, 92]. The post-2015 strategy of the\\nStop TB Partnership is more ambitious, aiming for a 90% re-\\nduction in tuberculosis incidence by 2035 [1]. Mathematical\\nmodeling highlights the contribution that an effective vaccine\\ncould make toward achievement of this goal [93]. Given the cur-\\nrent uncertainty in theﬁeld, there is a high risk of failure in the\\ndevelopment and testing of a new tuberculosis vaccine; howev-\\ner, as the potential gains in terms of reduced global mortality\\nand morbidity are also high, clinical development of tuberculo-\\nsis vaccine candidates must continue.\\nFollowing the failure of MVA85A, there has been no new,\\nhigh-proﬁle tuberculosis vaccine candidate entering clinical test-\\ning in the last 2 years. The number of candidates in clinical test-\\ning remains at 16 and can be divided into priming vaccines\\n(VPM1002, MTBV AC), prime-boost vaccines (M72 + AS0,\\nMV A85A, Crucell Ad35, Hybrid 1 + IC31, Hybrid 4 + IC31, Hy-\\nbrid 56 + IC31, Ad5Ag85A, ChAdOx1 85A + MV A85A, Combi-\\nnation Crucell Ad35 + MVA85A, DAR-901, ID93 + GLA-SE),\\nand immunotherapeutic vaccines (Mycobacterium indicus pranii,\\nMycobacterium vaccae,R U T I )[89]. As BCG confers some pro-\\ntection in childhood, the optimum strategy is believed to be a\\nprime-boost strategy in adolescents or young adults that would\\nprevent progression to pulmonary tuberculosis disease. However,\\nthe incidence of disease in adolescents is lower than that of in-\\nfants, and efﬁcacy trials in adolescents would be substantially\\nlarger than the MVA85A infant efﬁcacy trial, which recruited\\n2797 infants and had follow-up for a median of 24.6 months.\\nIn addition, with a large proportion of the population in tuber-\\nculosis-endemic countries already latently infected with tubercu-\\nlosis, the vaccine candidate likely to have the greatest impact on\\ntransmission would be one that worked both before and follow-\\ning latent tuberculosis infection [91].\\nSince 2013, attention has been focused on strategies for re-\\nducing the risk of failure in tuberculosis vaccine efﬁcacy trials\\nwith a disease endpoint. Such strategies include improving an-\\nimal models, human challenge models, and prevention of infec-\\ntion trials.

The\\nproportion of adverse events was significantly higher when the linezolid daily dosage exceeded 600 mg.

Out of 195 MDR/XDR-TB patients, 85 were treated with linezolid for a\\nmean of 221 d. Of these, 35/85 (41.2%) experienced major AEs attributed to linezolid (anaemia, thrombocytopenia and/or\\npolyneuropathy), requiring discontinuation in 27 (77%) cases. Most AEs occurred after 60 d of treatment. Twice-dailyadministration produced more major AE than once-daily dosing (P = .0004), with no difference in efficacy found. Outcomes\\nwere similar in patients treated with/without linezolid (P = .8), although linezolid-treated cases had more first-line (P = .002) and\\nsecond-line (P = .02) drug resistance and a higher number of previous treatment regimens (4.5 vs 2.3;P = .07). Linezolid 600\\nmg OD added to an individualized multidrug regimen may improve the chance of bacteriological conversion, providing a betterchance of treatment success in only the most complicated MDR/XDR-TB cases. Its safety profile does not warrant use incases for which there are other, safer, alternatives.\\n[66]\\nForty-one patients were enrolled, who had C-positive XDR-TB and who had not had a response to any available\\nchemotherapeutic option during the previous 6 mo. Patients were randomly assigned to linezolid therapy that startedimmediately or after 2 mo, at a dose of 600 mg per day, without a change in their OBR.

By 4 mo, 15/19 patients (79%) in the immediate-\\nstart group and 7/20 (35%) in the delayed-start group had C conversion (P = .001). In addition, 34/39 patients (87%) had a\\nnegative C within 6 mo after linezolid had been added to their drug regimen. Of the 38 patients with exposure to linezolid, 31(82%) had clinically significant AEs that were possibly or probably related to linezolid, including 3 patients who discontinued\\ntherapy. Patients who received 300 mg per day after the second randomization had fewer AEs than those who continued\\ntaking 600 mg per day. 13 patients completed therapy and have not had a relapse. 4 cases of acquired resistance to linezolidhave been observed. Linezolid is effective at achieving C conversion among patients with treatment-refractory pulmonaryXDR-TB, but patients must be monitored carefully for AEs.\\n[67]\\nThe authors evaluated treatment with linezolid (800 mg once daily for 1 to 4 mo as guided by SS/C status and tolerance and then\\nat 1200 mg thrice weekly until≥1 y after C conversion), in addition to OBD among 10 consecutive patients with XDR-TB or\\nfluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB. All achieved stable cure, with anemia corrected and neuropathy stabilized, ameliorated, oravoided after switching to intermittent dosing. Serum linezolid profiles appeared better optimized.\\n[68]\\nProspective pharmacokinetic study aimed at quantifying the effect of clarithromycin on the exposure of linezolid. All subjects\\nreceived 300 mg linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively coadministered with 250 mg and 500 mgclarithromycin once daily.

Mortality, treatment interruptions, defaulting, and AEs were all in line with DR-TB treatment outcomes\\noverall. The most commonly reported AEs were gastrointestinal disturbances and skin pigmentation. Clofazimine could beconsidered as an additional therapeutic option in the treatment of DR-TB. The optimal dose of clofazimine and duration of use\\nrequire further investigation.\\n[70]\\nThe authors searched multiple databases for studies published through February 2012 that reported use of Clofazimine in MDR-\\nand XDR-TB treatment regimens. They identified 9 observational studies (6 MDR-TB and 3 XDR-TB) including patients withMDR-TB treated with clofazimine. Overall, 65% (95% CI, 54– 76) of the patients experienced favorable outcomes (cure or\\ntreatment completion). Using random-effects meta-analysis, 65% (95% CI, 52– 79) of those with MDR-TB and 66% (95% CI,\\n42– 89) of those with XDR-TB experienced favorable treatment outcomes.\\n[71]\\nThe authors reported the treatment outcome of all patients with MDR-TB enrolled from May 1997 to December 2007. The most\\neffective treatment regimen (among 6 standardized treatment regimens) required a minimum of 9 mo of treatment with\\ngatifloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide throughout the treatment period supplemented by prothionamide,kanamycin, and high-dose isoniazid during an intensive phase of a minimum of 4 mo, giving a relapse-free cure of 87.9% (95%CI, 82.7– 91.6) among 206 patients. Major AEs were infrequent and manageable. Compared with the 221 patients treated with\\nregimens based on ofloxacin and commonly prothionamide throughout, the HR of any adverse outcome was 0.39 (95% CI,\\n.26– .59). Serial regimen formulation guided by overall treatment effectiveness resulted in treatment outcomes comparable to\\nthose obtained with first-line treatment.\\n[72]\\nThe study was aimed to directly compare the activity of a standard second-line drug regimen with or without the addition of\\nclofazimine in a mouse model of MDR-TB. Our comparative outcomes included time to C conversion in the mouse lungs and\\nthe percentage of relapses after treatment cessation. After 2 mo, the bacillary load in lungs was reduced from 9.74 log\\n10 at\\nbaseline to 3.61 and 4.68 in mice treated with or without clofazimine, respectively (P < .001). Mice treated with clofazimine\\nwere C-negative after 5 mo, whereas all mice treated without clofazimine remained heavily C-positive for the entire 9 mo of\\nthe study. The relapse rate was 7% among mice treated with clofazimine for 8– 9 mo. The clofazimine contribution was\\nsubstantial in these experimental conditions\\n[73]\\nMoxifloxacin Fluoroquinolone The study compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin (M) and high-dose levofloxacin (L) alone or in combination with ethio namide\\n(Et), amikacin (A), and pyrazinamide (Z) given for 2 or 7 mo. After 2 mo of treatment, lung CFU counts were similar in mice\\nreceiving either FQ alone, but, after 4 and 5 mo, CFU counts were 2 log10 lower in mice receiving moxifloxacin. Mice receiving\\n2MEtZA/3MEt and 2LEtZA/3LEt had 1.0 and 2.7 log10 lung CFUs, respectively. When Z was given throughout, both regimens\\nrendered mice culture negative by 5 mo, and most mice did not relapse after 7 mo of treatment, with fewer relapses observed\\nin the M group after 6 and 7 mo of treatment. In murine TB, M had superior efficacy compared with L despite lower serum drug\\nexposures and may remain the fluoroquinolone of choice for second-line regimens. Z contributed substantial sterilizing activitybeyond 2 mo in FQ-containing second-line regimens, largely compensating for L’s weaker activity.\\n[74]\\nThe study was aimed to compare the antimicrobial activity and safety of MXF vs isoniazid during the first 8 wk of combination\\ntherapy for pulmonary TB. Of 433 participants enrolled, 328 were eligible for the primary efficacy analysis. Of these, 35 (11%)\\nwere HIV positive, 248 (76%) had cavitation on baseline chest radiograph, and 213 (65%) were enrolled at African sites.Negative C at week 8 were observed in 90/164 (54.9%) participants in the isoniazid arm, and 99/164 (60.4%) in the MXF arm(P = .37). In multivariate analysis, cavitation and enrollment at an African site were associated with lower likelihood of week 8 C\\nnegativity.

At 3 mo of treatment, 68 (88.3%) of the 77 patients in the LFX\\ngroup and 67 (90.5%) of the 74 in the MXF group showed conversion to negative C (OR for LFX compared with MXF, 0.78;95%, CI, .27– 2.20). AEs were reported in 6 patients (7.7%) in the LFX group and 4 (5.2%) in the MXF group (P = .75). The\\nchoice of LFX or MXF for treatment of patients with MDR-TB may not affect sputum C conversion at 3 mo of treatment.\\n[76]\\nThe use of FQs to treat lower LTRIs other than TB allows selection of FQ-resistant TB when TB is misdiagnosed. This study maps\\nnational guidelines on the use of FQs for LRTIs in Europe and determines the risk of FQ-resistant TB upon FQ treatment beforeTB diagnosis. A questionnaire was developed to map existing national LRTI and CAP guidelines. A systematic review and\\nmeta-analysis were performed to determine the risk of FQ-resistant TB if prescribed FQs prior to TB diagnosis. 15 of 24 (80%)\\nresponding European Respiratory Society national delegates reported having national LRTI management guidelines, 7including recommendations on FQ use and 1 recommending FQs as the first-choice drug. 18/24 countries had national CAPmanagement guidelines, 2 recommending FQ as the drug of choice. 6 studies investigating FQ exposure and the risk of FQ-\\nresistant TB were analyzed. TB patients had a 3-fold higher risk of having FQ-resistant TB when prescribed FQs before TB\\ndiagnosis, compared to non-FQ-exposed patients (OR, 2.81, 95% CI, 1.47– 5.39). Although the majority of European countries\\nhold national LRTI/CAP guidelines, the results suggest that a risk of developing FQ resistance exists.\\n[77]\\nMeropenem-\\nclavulanate\\nCarbapenem- Clavulanic\\nacid\\nThe study was aimed to evaluate the contribution of meropenem-clavulanate when added to linezolid-containing regimens in\\nterms of efficacy and safety/tolerability in treating MDR- and XDR- TB cases after 3 mo of second-line treatment. The clinical\\nseverity of cases was worse than that of controls (drug susceptibility profile, proportion of SS positive and of re-treatmentcases). The group of cases yielded a higher proportion of SS converters (28/32 [87.5%] vs 9/16 [56.3%];P = .02) and C\\nconverters (31/37 [83.8%] vs 15 /24 [62.5%];P = .06). Excluding XDR-TB patients (11/98 [11.2%]), cases scored a significantly\\nhigher proportion of C converters than controls (P = .03). One case had to withdraw from meropenem-clavulanate due to\\nincreased transaminase levels. The results of our study provide: (1) preliminary evidence on effectiveness and safety/tolerability of meropenem-clavulanate; (2) reference to design further trials; and (3) a guide to clinicians for its rationale usewithin salvage/compassionate regimens.\\n[78]\\nRifapentine Rifamycins The study aimed to compare rifapentine and isoniazid once a week with rifampicin and isoniazid twice a week. 1004 patients\\nwere enrolled (502 per treatment group); 928 successfully completed treatment, and 803 completed the 28-mo study. Cruderates of failure/relapse were 46/502 (9.2%) in those on rifapentine once a week, and 28/502 (5.6%) in those given rifampicintwice a week (relative risk 1.64, 95% CI, 1.04– 2.58, P = .04). By proportional hazards regression, 5 characteristics were\\nindependently associated with increased risk of failure/relapse: C-positive at 2 mo (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.7– 4.6); cavitation on\\nchest radiography (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.6– 5.9); being underweight (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8– 4.9); bilateral pulmonary involvement\\n(HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0– 3.1); and being a non-Hispanic white person (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1– 3.0). Adjustment for imbalances in 2-\\nmonth C and cavitation diminished the association of treatment group with outcome (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, .83– 2.18; P = .23). Of\\nparticipants without cavitation, rates of failure/relapse were 6/210 (2.9%) in the once a week group and 6/241 (2.5%) in the\\ntwice a week group (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, .38– 3.50; P = .81). Rates of AEs and death were similar in the 2 treatment groups.\\nRifapentine once a week is safe and effective for treatment of pulmonary TB in HIV-negative people without cavitation onchest radiography. Clinical, radiographic, and microbiological data help to identify TB patients at increased risk of failure or\\nrelapse when treated with either regimen\\n[79]\\nThe study compared the antimicrobial activity and safety of rifapentine vs rifampicin during the first 8 wks of pulmonary TB\\ntreatment (intensive phase), with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Negative C on solid media occurred in 145/174\\nparticipants (83.3%) in the rifampicin group and 171 of 198 participants (86.4%) in the rifapentine group (difference, 3.0%;\\n95% CI,−4.3 to 10.5); negative C in liquid media occurred in 110/169 (65.1%) in the rifampicin group and 133/196 (67.9%) in\\nthe rifapentine group (difference, 2.8%; 95% CI,−6.9 to 12.4). Among 529 participants who received study therapy, 40/254\\nparticipants (15.7%) in the rifampicin group and 40/275 participants (14.5%) in the rifapentine group prematurely discontinued\\ntreatment (P = .79). The rifapentine regimen was safe but not significantly more active than a standard rifampicin regimen, by\\nthe surrogate endpoint of C status at completion of intensive phase.\\n[80]\\nS114 \\x81 CID 2015:61 (Suppl 3) \\x81 Schito et al'),\n",

The\\nEMI-TB Consortium (Eliciting Mucosal Immunity in Tubercu-\\nlosis), led by the Institute for Infection and Immunity, St Georg-\\ne’s University, London, was awarded€8 million to establish\\neffective mucosal immunity against Mtb (http://www.emi-tb.\\norg/). Both consortiums will be generating vaccine candidates\\nfor clinical testing, and with renewed activity in preclinical de-\\nvelopment, there is a need to prepare for future screening and\\ntesting of these candidates.\\nIn addition, the Global Tuberculosis Vaccine Partnership\\n(GTBVP), a global initiative working on tuberculosis vaccines,\\nis now being established. The GTBVP includes the European\\nCommission, the European Investment Bank, the Bill & Melinda\\nGates Foundation, and the Department of Science and Technol-\\nogy South Africa in collaboration with Aeras, TBVI, the South\\nAfrican Medical Research Council, and the European and De-\\nveloping Countries Clinical Trials Partnership. The aim of the\\nGTBVP is to mobilize and optimize use of globally available\\nfunds to manage the global vaccine pipeline efﬁciently and ef-\\nfectively, to provide a rational process for selecting the best can-\\ndidates and help them to move forward into the clinical\\ndevelopment, while ensuring they comply with established\\nand consensed criteria at the global level.\\nPreparation for clinical testing of a vaccine can substantially\\naccelerate the progression of a candidate. Recent studies have\\nshown that a subunit vaccine can be delivered safely to the\\nlung using an aerosol delivery device in both nonhuman primates\\nand humans Although these studies were performed with\\nMV A85A, the proof-of-concept safety and immunogenicity\\ndata generated from this study [94, 95] will accelerate the clinical\\ntesting of aerosol vaccines emerging from the TBV AC2020 and\\nEMI-TB consortiums.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe current status quo of the lengthy treatment duration and\\npoor treatment outcomes associated with MDR/XDR tuberculo-\\nsis, and with comorbidity of tuberculosis with HIV and noncom-\\nmunicable diseases, is unacceptable. New inn ovations for\\nshortening duration of therapy and improving treatment out-\\ncomes are urgently required. The tuberculosis drug pipeline re-\\nmains sparse. The tuberculosis drug pipeline remains thin [57].\\nA range of host-directed therapies, including cellular therapy, re-\\npurposed drugs, and immune-based therapies, are emerging [96–\\n101] and provide hope for reducing duration of therapy and im-\\nproving treatment of MDR tuberculosis. These require evaluation\\nin randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials as adjuncts to\\ncurrent tuberculosis treatment regimens. Meanwhile, proactive\\nscreening for tuberculosis using best available diagnostics, making\\nTable 4 continued.\\nDrug Class Main Findings Reference\\nUsing a mouse model with a high bacterial burden and human-equivalent drug dosing, the study compared the efficacy of\\nrifapentine- and MXF-containing regimens with that of the standard daily short-course regimen based on rifampicin, isoniazid,\\nand pyrazinamide.\\nBactericidal activity was assessed by lung CFU counts, and sterilizing activity was assessed by the proportion of mice with C-\\npositive relapse after 2, 3, 4, and 6 mo of treatment. The results demonstrate that replacing rifampicin with rifapentine and\\nisoniazid with MXF dramatically increased the activity of the standard daily regimen. After just 2 mo of treatment, mice\\nreceiving rifapentine- and MXF-containing regimens were found to have negative lung C, while those given the standardregimen still harbored 3.17 log\\n10 CFU in the lungs (P < .01). No relapse was observed after just 3 mo of treatment with daily\\nand thrice-weekly administered rifapentine- and MXF-containing regimens, whereas the standard daily regimen required 6 mo\\nto prevent relapse in all mice. Rifapentine should no longer be viewed solely as a rifamycin for once-weekly administration. The\\nresults suggest that treatment regimens based on daily and thrice-weekly administration of rifapentine and MXF may permitshortening the current 6 mo duration of treatment to 3 mo or less.\\n[81]\\nAbbreviations: τ2, tau-squared statistic; AE, adverse events; BID, twice daily; C, culture; CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; CFU, colony-forming unit; CI, confidence interval; DR-TB, drug- resistant tuberculosis; FQ,\\nfluoroquinolone; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HR, hazard ratio; LFX, levofloxacin; LTRI, respiratory tract infections; MDR-TB, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; MXF, moxifloxacin; OB, once daily; OBR, optimized\\nbackground regimen; OR, odds ratio; RR, relative risk; SS, sputum smear; SS/C, sputum smear and culture; TB, tuberculosis; TDM, therapeutic drug monitoring; XDR-TB, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.\\nAdvances in Clinical Tuberculosis Research\\x81 CID 2015:61 (Suppl 3) \\x81 S115'),\n",

Skin cancers are defined as either malignant or benign cells that typically arise from excessive exposure to UV radiation. Arguably, skin cancer is a type of cancer that can most easily be prevented; prevention of skin cancer is relatively simple, but often ignored. An important aspect in discussing the epidemiology of skin cancer is understanding the treatments that are available, as well as the prevention methods that can be implemented in every day practice. It is estimated that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer during his or her lifetime, and that one person will die from melanoma every hour of the day. To an epidemiologist and health promotion advocate, these figures are daunting for a disease, especially for a disease that has ample means of prevention.

Thus, skin cancers are cancers that arise from the abnormal division or mutation of skin cells. There are three main types of skin cancer: squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC), basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), and melanoma. Basal-cell skin cancer and squamous-cell skin cancer are both part of a broader category known as nonmelanoma skin cancer, whereas melanoma is an aggressive cancer that typically presents as a mole.

Population is defined as “all inhabitants of a given country or area considered together;” distribution is defined as “the occurrence of diseases and other health outcomes in various populations” while a determinant is “any factor that brings about a change in a health condition or other defined characteristic” (Friis, 2010, p. 282).

Primary prevention is before the disease ever occurs, secondary prevention is taking measures to prevent the disease while it is progressing, and tertiary prevention is during the later stages of the disease (Friis, 2010). Another important aspect of epidemiology is looking at the number of cases, both current cases and the number of new cases, in studying a disease; epidemiologists define this as the prevalence and incidence of a specific disease.

Average annual total treatment costs for skin cancer also increased substantially between these periods to $8.1 billion annually. Increased skin cancer treatment costs resulted from an increase in the number of people treated for skin cancer and an increase in per person treatment costs. Annual spending increased more rapidly for skin cancers than for other cancers, suggesting that the economic burden of skin cancer is a particular cause for concern. (p. 184) As Guy (2015) concludes, overexposure to the sun causes damage beyond skin cancer; it also causes a variety of financial burdens in caring for the skin cancer that could have been prevented.

The World Health Organization estimates that 65,000 people die from melanoma each year worldwide; these numbers are astounding seeing that there are ample ways to prevent the cultivation of melanoma.

Typically, signs of aging, which may include sagging skin, age spots, and wrinkles, are a direct result of overexposure to UV light; often skin damage begins in the adolescent years, and is not recognized until the later in life. This is the sole reason that annual skin checks and self-assessments are so important to the prevention of skin cancer and education about the effects of improper skin care.   There are many facets of skin cancer to consider when studying skin cancer and mortality in ethnic minorities. P. Bradford (2009) claims that “multiple studies have demonstrated 5-year melanoma survival rates of Blacks and Hispanics are consistently lower than those of Caucasians. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics and Blacks tend to present with more advanced, thicker tumors and thus tend to have a poorer prognosis, with higher mortality. (p. 170).

Education and Health Promotion of Skin Cancer Prevention  As previously stated, the most important way to address skin cancer is prevention. Too often, sun damage is done when individuals are in their early teens and twenties, and they do not see the harm that they are doing until much later in life. It is vital that every individual, whether a ten-year-old girl or an 80-year-old man, wears some sort of sunscreen every single day. It is proved that this one action alone can reduce the risk of melanoma by over 50% (AAD, 2016). It could be argued that while skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, it is also the most preventable kind of cancer. While many cancers have to do with genetic mutations, skin cancer simply results from the overexposure to the sun, and the risk could be greatly reduced by applying a sunscreen-'),\n",

There is an interesting program in place in Australia called SunSmart with promotes prevention. According to G. Guy (2015), The SunSmart public education program promoting sun protection and skin cancer prevention messages through structural, environmental, and legislative initiatives was estimated to save 22,000 life years, while saving approximately $2 for every dollar invested. Reducing indoor tanning, which is associated with an increased risk of NMSC and melanoma is also an important strategy for decreasing the burden of skin cancer.

As important as sunscreen use and skin checks are to prevention, discouraging the use tanning beds and overexposure to the sun are vital to promoting skin cancer prevention (Narayanan, 2010).

As you can see from the context provided by AI, it is not possible to identify a single condition that matches all your symptoms.  To provide accurate diagnosis and treatment advice, I need more information about you such as age, medical history, medications used, family history of any conditions, physical examination findings, blood tests results etc. I also recommend consulting a doctor or healthcare provider near you who can assess you clinically and order appropriate investigations if needed.

       "\"Hi! It's nice to know that you are interested in knowing the causes of asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the respiratory tract and is characterized by periodic episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The exact causes of this condition are still not well understood but are known to be influenced by various factors. Some of these include: 1) Genetic predisposition - if you have a family history of asthma or other allergies, you may be at greater risk for developing it. 2) Allergies - exposure to allergens such as dust mites, pollen, and pet dander can trigger an allergic reaction in the airways. This is often accompanied by symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. 3) Respiratory infections - viral infections that cause respiratory tract infections can also trigger asthma attacks. 4) Air pollution - exposure to polluted air can irritate your airways and make them more susceptible to inflammation. 5) Stress - stress is known to exacerbate existing asthma symptoms, but there is limited evidence about it as an independent risk factor for the condition. 6) Obesity - obesity has been linked to a higher risk of developing asthma in children and adolescents. For this reason, maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and a balanced diet is important for preventing asthma attacks. 7) Environmental factors - exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides can contribute to the development of asthma. 8) Smoking - smoking can irritate your airways and increase the risk of developing asthma. 9) Family history - if one or both parents have asthma, you may be more likely to develop it yourself. 10) Exposure to second-hand smoke - exposure to second-hand smoke is also a known trigger for asthma attacks.\\n\\nThe causes of asthma can vary from person to person and can include any combination of the above-mentioned factors. However, with proper diagnosis and treatment using medication and lifestyle changes, you can effectively manage your symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.\""

So better to avoid lifting heavy objects until the pain subsides. You should take a warm bath with water for 15 minutes and then apply hot fomentation over the affected area. This will help in quick relief of your symptoms.
